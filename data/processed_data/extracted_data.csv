The...",2023-01-27 00:00:00,Indian Tycoon’s Conglomerate Shaken by Market Rout,"The conglomerate controlled by Gautam Adani, the politically connected Indian industrialist, lost about $50 billion in value this week after it was upended by a small investment firm in New York.

Late in the day on Tuesday, Hindenburg Research, a firm that made its name by betting against cryptocurrency companies and unprofitable electric vehicle makers, published a report accusing the billionaire tycoon’s company, the Adani Group, of “a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme.” After an initial market wobble on Wednesday, trading paused on Thursday, when markets in India closed for the country’s annual Republic Day.

But when trading resumed on Friday, some of Mr. Adani’s companies dropped 20 percent in frenzied trading, the maximum allowed by exchanges, before trading was halted. India’s benchmark stock index fell 1.6 percent that day, its worst drop in more than a month. Overall, the Adani Group lost about a fifth of its value since the Hindenburg report was released.

The Adani Group has dismissed Hindenburg’s allegations in a series of rebuttals, calling them “a maliciously mischievous attempt” to profit by sinking its shares. “The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens,” the company’s legal chief said, and threatened to sue.","The conglomerate controlled by Gautam Adani, the politically connected Indian industrialist, lost about $50 billion in value this week after it was upended by a small investment firm in New York.

India’s largest life insurer is plowing more money into Gautam Adani ’s flagship unit, undeterred by a short seller’s fraud allegations that wiped out more than $50 billion of the conglomerate’s market value in two sessions.State-controlled Life Insurance Corp. of India is spending about 3 billion rupees ($37 million) as an anchor investor in a $2.5 billion new share sale by Adani Enterprises Ltd ., according to a filing. The investment would add to its current holding of 4.23%.LIC’s investment signaled its vote of confidence in Asia’s richest man and his beleaguered group on Jan. 25, which is facing its toughest test yet after US-based Hindenburg Research in its report earlier this week characterized its meteoric rise as “the largest con in corporate history.” LIC is among 33 institutional investors coming in as anchors in the FPO, along with names such as Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Al Mehwar Commercial Investments LLC.While the amount Mumbai-based LIC is investing is relatively tiny — considering it has almost 43 trillion rupees of assets under management at LIC — it marks a contrarian position to other domestic financial institutions that have little to no Adani investments. It also comes in the face of a contagion that hit stocks exposed to Adani Group , including LIC that plunged the most in more than a month on Friday in Mumbai.“LIC thinks contrarian,” said Arun Kejriwal, founder of Kejriwal Research & Investment. “It has always minted money whenever there is market volatility. It doesn’t receive money for short duration. It acts as long-only fund.”An email and text messages sent to the LIC chairman seeking comments on its Adani Group investments were not immediately answered.With over 250 million policy holders across India and assets under management as large as the nation’s mutual fund industry, LIC is among India’s systemically most important institutions. Its exposure to the Adani Group, known to be closely aligned to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development goals, is also symbolic of the tycoon’s political clout. LIC is an investor in five Adani companies , with stakes ranging from 1% to 9% that was worth a total of 722.68 billion rupees on Jan. 24 — just before the Hindenburg report was published.No other Indian insurance company has any significant holding, as per December 2022 data filed with stock exchanges. Most mutual funds have largely stayed away from the group, despite some wild rallies seen by some of the stocks. Adani Enterprises for instance, surged over 1,900% in the last five years, trumping even the likes of Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc.The high exposure of state-backed financial institutions “has implications for financial stability” and for the millions of Indians “whose savings are stewarded by these pillars of the financial system,” Jairam Ramesh, a lawmaker with the opposition Indian National Congress party, said in a statement Friday.The sell off triggered by Hindenburg’s report may now be adding more weight to such concerns. The rout deepened Thursday, with some units like Adani Green Energy Ltd . and Adani Total Gas Ltd. tumbling by their daily limit of 20%. Adani Enterprises fell 19%.The short seller has alleged that Adani Group was involved in “brazen” market manipulation, accounting fraud, used offshore shells for money laundering and siphoned from listed companies. The conglomerate has dismissed the report as “a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations.” It said it’s also exploring legal action.Last week, Adani Group Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh acknowledged the lack of interest shown by domestic institutional investors.“We understand mutual funds missed Adani growth stock rally,” he said at a press briefing. “We should have communicated to mutual funds.”","It also comes in the face of a contagion that hit stocks exposed to Adani Group , including LIC that plunged the most in more than a month on Friday in Mumbai.“LIC thinks contrarian,” said Arun Kejriwal, founder of Kejriwal Research & Investment.

Adani Group has dismissed the report as baseless and said it is considering whether to take legal action against the New York-based firm. The conglomerate termed the report on the group ‘malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale’ and is exploring legal action against the US investor on its report alleging ‘brazen’ market manipulation and accounting fraud by Asia’s richest man’s empire.

In a statement later on Twitter, Hindenburg said it fully stands by its report and would in fact welcome any legal action by Adani group. “If Adani is serious, it should also file suit in the U.S. where we operate. We have a long list of documents we would demand in a legal discovery process,"" the statement posted on Twitter read.

The Adani Group has been diversifying its business interests and last year bought cement firms ACC and Ambuja Cements from Switzerland's Holcim for $10.5 billion. ACC was down 15% on Friday, while Ambuja plunged up to 25%.

The most-liquid stocks controlled by the Adani Group, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd and Ambuja Cements, are also the most vulnerable in the event of an extended selloff in the diversified conglomerate’s shares, as per Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Nitin Chanduka.

Adani Group had announced the acquisition of Holcim's stake in Ambuja (63.19%) and stake in ACC (4.48%; Ambuja directly owns around 50% stake in ACC). Adani Group's open offer for a 26% stake each in Ambuja/ACC ended on September 9, 2022.

Adani Enterprises shares lost more than 19% on Friday, sliding below the ₹3,276 level at which anchor investors were allotted shares in the follow-on equity sale. Adani Transmission shares tumbled over 19% and Adani Total Gas sank 19.1% in their biggest daily drop since mid-March 2020, while Adani Green Energy sank about 16% on the BSE.

NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s Adani Group vehemently objected Wednesday to allegations by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research that caused shares in its companies to plunge by as much as 8.1%.

Hindenburg issued a report late Tuesday saying it was betting against shares in companies within the Adani empire, founded by Asia’s richest man, coal magnate Gautam Adani. Businesses in the conglomerate span industries including construction, data transmission, media, renewable energy, defense manufacturing and agriculture.

Adani made a vast fortune mining coal as energy hungry India grew swiftly after its economy was liberalized in the 1990s. The market value of his companies has soared in recent years, one of the reasons Hindenburg said it judged the seven key Adani listed companies to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.”

Shares in Adani Transmission plunged 8.1% on Wednesday. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. sank 6.1% and other group companies fell between 1.1% to 5%. The lost market capitalization amounted to more than $9 billion, according to the Financial Times.

The Adani Group’s chief financial officer issued a statement expressing shock over Hindenburg’s report, which he called a “malicious combination of misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts.”

“The group has always been in compliance with all laws, regardless of jurisdiction, and maintains the highest standards of corporate governance,” said the statement by group CFO Jugeshinder Singh.

Hindenburg Research said its report followed a two-year investigation. It alleged the Adani Group had engaged in stock price manipulation and accounting fraud, among other abuses. It said its report listed 88 questions it invited the company to answer.

The company is well-known for short-selling. That involves borrowing a stock one expects to lose value and selling it at its current market price with the plan to buy the same number of shares back later at a lower price.","FILE- Adani group Chairman Gautam Adani speaks during the inauguration of the 9th Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit in Gandhinagar, India, Jan. 18, 2019.

Billionaire Gautam Adani has slipped from being the world’s third richest man to the fourth, after an activist investment firm released a report Tuesday accusing his company, Adani Group, of “brazen” stock manipulation and accounting fraud worth $218 billion, wiping $5.51 billion from his personal net worth by Thursday.

Hindenburg Research, which in the past has shorted—or bet against—companies like electric truck maker Nikola Corp and Twitter, said it holds short positions in Adani companies through U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.

Tuesday’s report sent shares tied to seven of the Adani Group’s listed companies falling by more than 5% on Wednesday, taking a $10.8 billion hit, and forcing the company to issue a strong denial of its contents.

Below, what to know about Adani and the corporate corruption allegations.

Who is Gautam Adani?

Gautam Adani is a self-made billionaire, and India’s richest man, with a net worth of roughly $118 billion as of April 2022. Much of this wealth was accumulated during the past three years through his company Adani Group, as the share prices of his key listed companies climbed, pushing the billionaire’s rank to the third-richest man in the world, behind Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

The industrialist began as a commodity trader in the 1980s before he founded his company Adani Group in 1988, eventually expanding it into a private infrastructure empire that operates ports, airports, and coal mines across India and the world. The group also has multiple subsidiaries through its data and cable centers and the manufacturing of defense goods. It plans to expand further through a $70 billion investment in green energy businesses in the coming year.

The company’s success has often been linked to lucrative government concessions, thanks to Adani’s close ties with India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. In the past, Adani has been a vocal supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for a “self-reliant India.”

What do Hindenburg’s findings reveal?

Among other allegations, the report says that Adani Group engaged in stock price manipulation and accounting fraud over the course of decades, and found evidence that the group’s key listed companies fell in value by 85% despite “sky-high valuations.” It also said that substantial debt puts the group on “precarious financial footing.”

The report names several family members—like Gautam Adani’s brothers, Rajesh and Vinod Adani, as well as associates of the Adani Group—for their involvement in major bribery and tax evasion cases. Members of the Adani family have been the subjects of past corruption investigations carried out by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Directorate of Review Intelligence. The Hindenburg report also claims that Adani family members allegedly cooperated in the creation of offshore shell entities worth $4.5 billion through forged documents, primarily in tax-haven jurisdictions like Mauritius, the UAE, and the Caribbean islands. Hindenburg said that SEBI was still investigating a case in Mauritius in September 2022, but that no action has been taken against the group so far.

Hindenburg said the report’s findings were based on interviews with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives at Adani Group, thousands of documents, and due diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.

How has the Adani Group responded to the allegations?

Adani Group’s chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh said in an official statement Wednesday that the company was shocked by the report, calling it a “malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless, and discredited allegations.”

Adani Group did not address specific allegations in its official statement but said it has always been in compliance with the law. The conglomerate also said that the timing of the report suggested malicious intent to “undermine the Adani Group’s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming follow-on Public Offering from Adani Enterprises,” referring to the group’s plans for increasing the amount of freely traded shares.

On Thursday, Adani Group said in a new statement that it is considering legal action against Hindenburg. “We are evaluating the relevant provisions under US and Indian laws for remedial and punitive action against Hindenburg Research,” said Adani Group Legal Head Jatin Jalundhwala. He added that the report created “volatility in Indian stock markets” that was “of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens.”

The report was published days before bidding for a $2.5 billion stock sale for Adani’s secondary shares begins Friday, which will include anchor investors like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Morgan Stanley.","Gautam Adani is a self-made billionaire, and India’s richest man, with a net worth of roughly $118 billion as of April 2022.

NEW DELHI: Just as when billionaire Gautam Adani was busy selling fresh shares worth Rs 20,000 crore of his empire's flagship company Adani Enterprises , in an FPO, he was left ambushed by a 106-page-long report by American whistle-blower and short-seller Hindenburg Research. Alleging accounting fraud, stock manipulation and other corporate governance issues, the report left a meteoric impact on both Adani's personal wealth as well as those of shareholders.In the last two trading days, Thursday being a market holiday, the 60-year-old Ahmedabad-based college dropout has been left poorer by around $29 billion, pushing him to the seventh slot in the elite list of world's richest billionaires.Adani is now behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in the rich list but still ahead of Carlos Slim Helu's family and Google co-founder Larry Page.Data from the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list shows that Adani lost around $21.9 billion today alone, and his wealth is now estimated at $97.3 billion.Five out of 10 Adani Group stocks - Adani Ports , Adani Enterprises, Adani Transmission Adani Green , and Adani Total Gas - lost around 20% each during the day. The worst hit was Ambuja Cements which lost up to 25% before recouping some of the losses.Today was the second distressing day for the self-made business mogul's empire on Dalal Street. Investors have altogether lost around Rs 4 lakh crore in a span of just 2 days.In the damaging report, Hindenburg alleged stock manipulation and accounting frauds at Adani Group. ""Even if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations,"" the report said. As a disclaimer, the firm, led by Nate Anderson, said it had taken short positions in Adani Group companies.Proxy advisory firm InGovern said Hindenburg, as a short seller, should be considered as just another market participant with a motivated view, releasing a negative report to bring down the stock price.Adani Group, as well as some analysts, raised questions about the timing of the release of the report, which coincided with the largest-ever FPO in India.Dalal Street veteran Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL Securities said the longer-term prospects of Adani Enterprises remain very robust.""You cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt, and it is a misnomer that I think all their businesses are in fine shape. So I would definitely advocate a buy, at least in the FPO,"" he said.Bhasin also said Gujarat Ambuja and Adani Ports are looking very attractive at this price.","Sensex crashes over 850 points on Adani rout; Nifty below 17,650; PSU stocks bleed After a 774-point crash seen on Wednesday derivative expiry day, Sensex ended Friday with a loss of 874 points as a report by American firm Hindenburg Research left Adani Group stocks bleeding.

Adani Group and Azerbaijan are planning to hold comprehensive discussions on future collaboration.

Recently, Adani met with the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev in Davos.

As per the statement released by the office of the President of Azerbaijan, during the discussions, both parties noted that ""Azerbaijan is the initiator of the East-West and North-South transport corridors, as well as one of the major transport-logistics hubs, and explored potential avenues of cooperation in this respect.""

Thereby, the statement added, ""the parties discussed Azerbaijan's attractiveness for foreign direct investments, the development of the country's economy, and the prospects for cooperation with the Adani Group in petrochemical, mining, and metallurgical industries, as well as other areas of mutual interest.""

Also, they acknowledged the significance of the Middle Corridor via Azerbaijan within the context of the East-West transportation corridor.

Further, the statement highlighted that as per Gautam Adani, the firm has vast experience in the fields of port management, transport, and transportation in India and other regions of the world and has made direct investments in these fields in a number of nations.

Accordingly, Adani and the Republic of Azerbaijan's President agreed ""to conduct reciprocal visits of delegations and to hold comprehensive discussions on future collaboration.""

Asia's richest man is set to launch its much-awaited follow-on public offer (FPO) on Friday at a price band of ₹ ₹3,112 to ₹3,276 per FPO equity share. The FPO is to the tune of ₹20,000 crore.

Bidding was allowed for anchor investors in the FPO on January 25, and the remaining investors including retail investors will be able to bid from January 27 to January 31st.

If the FPO is fully subscribed, then Adani's ₹20,000 crore offer will become the second largest follow-on public offer in India after Coal India's ₹22,558 crore issue in 2015. Earlier in 2020, Yes Bank had launched a ₹15,000 crore FPO.

A study by market regulator SEBI shows that 9 out of 10 individual traders were making losses in the F&O segment. They made an average loss of ₹1.1 lakh during financial year 2022. As high as 90 per cent of active traders incurred an average loss of ₹1.25 lakh.

India is the world’s largest market for trading in equity F&O, which most experts say is nothing but a form of gambling. Yet, F&O trading has seen a stupendous five-fold growth in less than four years between FY19 and FY22.

According to SEBI, samples from only the top 10 brokers showed that in FY22 there were 45.2 lakh unique individual traders in the F&O segment, up from just 7.1 lakh in FY19. Of this, 88 per cent were active traders, who were making consistent losses. Over 80 per cent of traders in the F&O segment were male.

About 98 per cent of all retail derivative traders were dabbling in the ultra-high risk options segment and 11 per cent in futures in FY22 compared to 89 per cent and 43 per cent, respectively, in FY19.

A new fad

Experts say F&O trading has become a fad due to the mushrooming of discount broking firms that lure traders with fast mobile apps and zero brokerage. In FY22, nearly 35 per cent of the F&O players were in 20- 30 years age group, rising from just 11 per cent in FY19.

Among the active traders (excluding outliers), the average net loss stood at ₹50,000 in FY22, which was 15 times higher than those who made average profits. Only 11 per cent individual traders made an average profit of ₹1.5 lakh. In this, active traders that made an average ₹1.9 lakh at 10 per cent. In this, too, excluding the outliers, 6 per cent of individual traders made an average profit of ₹3,400.

Only the top 1 per cent and 5 per cent active traders who were also profit-makers accounted for nearly 51 per cent and 75 per cent of the profits, respectively, in the retail segment, data showed.

Young traders (under 20) who accounted for 1 per cent share posted the highest average profits among those who made profits. Also, the same age group traders suffered the largest average loss among all the loss makers compared to all other age groups.

In FY22, 89 per cent of the individuals who traded in index options, and 82 per cent in the stock options incurred an average loss of ₹0.77lakh and ₹0.66 lakh, respectively. Among the loss makers, 74 per cent and 67 per cent traders in index and stock futures suffered an average loss of ₹0.96 lakh and ₹2.1 lakh, respectively.

Hedge solution

Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Securities, said: “The data is an eye opener. Curbs on individual F&O traders seem an urgent need. Solution is to push retail traders towards F&O products and funds that operate on hedge mechanism. If retail clients use back-tested F&O software that can hedge positions, then the probability of their making a loss will fall sharply. Funds can design such products, which should be back-tested before being allowed. It will help F&O trading to be conducted in an organised manner.”

Yet, F&O trading has seen a stupendous five-fold growth in less than four years between FY19 and FY22. According to SEBI, samples from only the top 10 brokers revealed that there were 45.2 lakh unique individual traders who participated in F&O trading in FY22 up from just 7.1 lakh in FY19. In this, 88 per cent were active traders, who were making consistent losses. Over 80 per cent of traders in F&O were male participants. About 98 per cent of all the retail derivative traders were dabbling in the ultra-high risk options segment and 11 per cent traders in futures in FY22 as compared to 89 per cent and 43 per cent, respectively during FY19. In this, share of traders in the age group of 20-30 years was over 30 per cent in FY22 compared to 11 per cent in FY19.

Gaining momentum

Experts say F&O trading is a fad that gained momentum due to the mushrooming of discount broking firms that lure traders with fast mobile apps and zero brokerage. Nearly 36 per cent of the F&O players in India during FY22 were in the age group of 20-30 years. Their participation has risen significantly since FY19 when it was just 11 per cent.

Among the active traders (excluding outliers), average net losses stood at ₹50,000 in FY22, which was 15 times higher than those who made average profits. Only 11 per cent individual traders made an average profit of ₹1.5 lakh. In this, active traders that made an average ₹1.9 lakh profit stood at 10 per cent. In this too, excluding the outliers, 6 per cent individual traders made an average profit of nearly ₹3,400. Only the top 1 per cent and 5 per cent active traders who were also profit makers accounted for nearly 51 per cent and 75 per cent of the profits, respectively, in the retail segment, data showed.

Young traders (age group <20 years) that accounted for 1 per cent share witnessed the highest average profits among those who made profits. Also, the same age group traders suffered the largest average loss among all the loss makers compared to all other age groups. During FY22, 89 per cent of the individuals that traded in index options, 82 per cent in the stock options incurred an average loss of ₹0.77 lakh and ₹0.66 lakh, respectively. Among the loss makers 74 per cent and 67 per cent traders in index futures and stock futures suffered an average loss of ₹0.96 lakh and ₹2.1 lakh, respectively.

The stock which closed at Rs 617.6 on December 30, 2022 fell to Rs 546.20 on January 23 2023, losing 11.56% during the period. However, Adani Wilmar stock became a multibagger last year after a muted market debut. The Adani Group stock made its market debut on February 8, 2022 at Rs 221 on BSE. By the end of last year, the stock had delivered 179.40% returns to investors.

Meanwhile, the stock is also trading 38% lower to its record high of Rs 878.35 on April 28, 2022 on BSE.

In the current trading session, Adani Wilmar stock rose 2.53% to Rs 560 on BSE. Total 1.76 lakh shares of the firm changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 9.88 crore on BSE. Market cap of the firm rose to Rs 72,788 crore.

In the previous session, Adani Wilmar stock ended 1.51% lower at Rs 546.20 on BSE. Total 1.29 lakh shares changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 7.13 crore on BSE. Market cap of the firm fell to Rs 70,998 crore.

In terms of technicals, the relative strength index (RSI) of Adani Wilmar stock stands at 36.8, signaling neither the stock is overbought nor oversold. The PE ratio of Adani Wilmar stands at 87.86 signaling the stock is overvalued compared to the industry. The PE of the industry stands at 66.65. Adani Wilmar shares are trading lower than 5 day, 20 day, 50 day, 100 day and 200 day moving averages

The Adani Group firm reported a 73 per cent fall in net profit for the quarter ended September 2022. Net profit slipped to Rs 49 crore against Rs 182 crore profit in the second quarter of the previous fiscal. However, revenue rose 5% to Rs 14,209 crore in Q2 against Rs 13,584 crore in the September quarter of the previous fiscal.

Here’s a look at what analysts and brokerages said on the prospects of the stock amid the ongoing correction and post December quarter earnings.

Vaishali Parekh, Vice President - Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher said, “Recently, the stock has slipped below the crucial support zone of Rs 560 levels weakening the bias and is anticipated to witness some more slide with next major support near Rs 490-495 zone. For the bias to improve from current levels, it has to move past the Rs 590-595 zone decisively to establish some conviction for further continuation of the uptrend.

Currently, the overall bias is weak with further slide expected and next major support zone near Rs 490-495 levels. Of late the stock has witnessed diminished volume participation with gradual slide happening and for the bias to improve, one should wait for some positive movement with decent volume participation to be witnessed where one can establish some view to buy the stock.

The stock has slipped heavily and moved past below the significant 200DMA level of Rs 635 last month weakening the bias and trend. As per the daily chart, further slide is anticipated keeping the previous low of Rs 495 zone as the major support zone.”

Ganesh Dongre, Sr. Manager - Technical Research Analyst, Anand Rathi Shares and stock Brokers said, ""On the daily chart, the stock is still under selling pressure. On the indicator front, the stock is also trading below 200DMA, which is a sign of weakness. So until we don't cross 200DMA which stands at Rs 640, we will avoid this stock as a fresh buy. Also on the weekly chart, the stock is still making lower highs and lower low formations indicating nervousness among the participants. So, we will avoid buying this stock at the current level.""

Rajesh Palviya, VP - Technical and Derivative Research, Axis Securities said, “The stock has been consolidating on a monthly chart in the range of Rs 850-860 on the upside and Rs 530-550 on the downside. Any sustained move below the Rs 530 level will lead to a decisive fall, while on the other hand, it needs to cross Rs 650-670 levels for a significant upward move.

Currently, the stock is trading well below its 50, 100 & 200-day moving averages indicating overall limited upside. However, a sustained move below the Rs 530-525 mark on a closing basis will turn out to be daunting, testing lower levels.

As per the current trend, conservative-long term investors can opt for the wait-and-watch strategy and, after the breakout on the upside, may initiate a buy. Traders, who are not risk averse, can initiate a buy at the current market price with a stop loss of Rs 520 for a target of Rs 600-620.

On the daily chart, we noticed Adani Wilmar had formed a Bearish Engulfing Pattern indicating a downtrend for a short-to-immediate term. However, the impact of the same is more significant if it occurs after a significant up move in price accompanied by large candles, which are not cent percent accurate in the current case. So to make an inference from the pattern, we can say that a YES bearish pattern has formed but of a lesser magnitude. It will ultimately be the price action that is likely to dominate the trend.”

Ashish Manoj Katwa, Technical Research Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio said, “On the weekly scale, AWL has been trading continuously in the bearish channel since the April 25, 2022. In addition, the price has settled below the 20, 50 & 100 Exponential Moving averages which would be short-term concerning. However, the stock is taking support near the 50% retracement level, if it breaks this level, the stock may move toward the 490 to 485 zone.

AWL has given handsome return to the investor after the listing of the IPO. Now, the stock is trading in a broad consolidation range with pessimistic buyers, indicating a short-term correction in the stock. Investors opt to buy in decline cautiously as stock may slowly rebound from the current level, in the coming days. It would be a better opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate the stocks in the Rs 490 to 485 zone. An Important level to watch on the upside is Rs 670.

On the weekly chart, the price has been falling continuously in a bearish channel with Lower Highs & Lower Lows formation from the last couple of weeks. The price has respected the channel's upper and lower trend line every time it has touched. At the same time, on a daily chart, the stock has given a breakdown of the consolidation pattern indicating a bearish trend may continue in the near term. The technical indicator Ichimoku cloud suggests that the price is trading below the cloud which now acts as an immediate Resistance for the stocks. RSI on the weekly and daily timeframe is below 50 marks reflecting the bearish pressure in the price.”

Abhijeet from Tips2trade said, ""Slowing urban consumption resulting in expected drop in margins is leading to a fall in consumer stocks including Adani Wilmar. Currently 566 becomes a strong gap down resistance and a fall till support of 550.8-524 looks a possibility. Investors should buy only if Daily close is above 566 for targets of 623-637 in the near term.""

DUBAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding Company (IHC.AD) on Monday said it would invest 1.4 billion dirhams ($381.17 million) in Adani Enterprises' (ADEL.NS) follow-on public offer.

IHC's statement comes as the Indian company, owned by Asia's richest man, Gautam Adani, has faced losses of $65 billion in its companies' market value after Adani's rebuttal of a U.S. short-seller's criticism failed to pacify investors.

""Our interest in Adani Group is driven by our confidence and belief in the fundamentals of Adani Enterprises Ltd; we see a strong potential for growth from a long-term perspective and added value to our shareholders,"" IHC CEO Syed Basar Shueb said in a statement.

IHC, Abu Dhabi's largest listed company, invested $2 billion in Adani Group companies last year, including Adani Enterprises.

Adani Group has hit back at the report by Hindenburg Research published last week that flagged concerns about Adani Group's debt levels and the use of tax havens.

Adani said it complied with all local laws and had made the necessary regulatory disclosures.

Investors' response to Hindenburg's criticisms will be tested this week by Adani Enterprises' $2.5 billion follow-on share offering which closes on Tuesday.

""The advantage of the FPO (follow-on offer) is the historical reference for the company's earnings report, company's management, business practices, and much data to bank on before making any investment decision,"" Shueb said in a statement, which did not mention the Hindenburg report or its impact.

IHC spokesman Ahmad Ibrahim has said the company does not comment on other businesses' activities as a matter of policy.

Shueb said the company was ""watching the international market closely for new prospects, and we will continue exploring further opportunities outside our traditional market in 2023.""

The Abu Dhabi conglomerate is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE's national security adviser and a brother of the UAE's president. It has seen a meteoric rise to dominate Abu Dhabi's stock market, with two of its subsidiaries among the top four companies by valuation.

IHC is looking to boost its global acquisitions by 70% this year, with a focus on the clean energy and food processing sectors, it said.

Hindenburg Research's report accused Adani of stock manipulation...,2023-01-28 15:01:12+05:30,'Myths of short seller': Adani gives point by point reply to Hindenberg's allegations,"The timing could not have been worse for Gautam Adani's ₹20,000 crore follow-on public offer (FPO) which came at a time when investors were offloading their positions in the group's seven listed stocks extensively. It was a bloodbath on Friday, with Adani stocks hitting lower circuits and some of them even witnessing a double-digit decline. The reason behind the free fall in Adani stocks would be Hindenburg Research's allegations over the Group. However, Adani has fought back by giving a much clear picture of its business portfolio.

On Friday, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas closed at 20% lower circuits each. While Adani Power and Adani Wilmar hit 5% lower circuits each. Adani Ports wasn't performing any better and tumbled by over 16% at the end of the day.

Meanwhile, Adani's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, which launched its FPO on Friday, nosedived by around 20% before closing at ₹2,762.15 apiece on BSE.

The first day of the FPO saw muted demand across investors.

Under the ₹20,000 crore worth FPO, on Friday, only 4,70,160 equity shares were bid against the offered size of 4,55,06,791 equity shares. The price band for the FPO is set from ₹3,112 to ₹3,276 per FPO equity share for all categories of investors.

If Adani's FPO is fully subscribed, then this will become the second largest follow-on public offer in India after Coal India's ₹22,558 crore issue in 2015. Earlier in 2020, Yes Bank had launched a ₹15,000 crore FPO.

But circumstances changed drastically a few days before Adani's FPO and it would be Hindenburg Research's report under which it accused Adani of stock manipulation and fraud schemes.

In its report on January 24, the New York-based investment research firm said, ""we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the ₹17.8 trillion ($218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.""

Hindenburg's report indicated that Gautam Adani, Founder, and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group’s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.

The findings of Hindenburg's research report on Adani involved interactions with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of Adani and also reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.

Also, the research said, even ""if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.""

Adani companies' debt was also among the key factors that Hindenburg pointed out.

It said, key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported ‘current ratios’ below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.

Hindenburg's research note came as a shock and Adani stocks went into frenzied selling.

Although, Adani has denied Hindenburg's accusations.

On January 27th, Adani Enterprises filed a presentation covering Adani Group’s response to Hindenburg Report. It was titled ""Myths of Short Seller"".

Hindenburg is the short seller.

According to Adani's presentation, Hindenburg asked 89 questions in total. While some of these questions are in regards to the group's related party transactions, DRI (Directorate of Revenue Intelligence), and court cases. However, there are 21 questions in total that cannot be claimed to be the result of any investigation over a 2-year period or any such assertion as they were disclosed in public documents all the way back from 2015 onwards.

Further, Adani said, 8 of 9 listed companies have a big 6 auditor such as Deloitte Haskins & Sells, SRBC & Co. (EY), SRBC & Co. (EY) & Dharmesh Parikh & Co. (Joint Auditors), Shah Dhandharia & Co., Ernst & Young, PKF, Walker Chandiok & Co. and K S Rao & Co., etc.

Moreover, on the leverage issue, Adani mentioned 100 of its various companies are rated ( these account for nearly 100% of its EBITDA). Also, in regards to revenue or balance sheet being artificially inflated or managed, it said, out of 9 listed companies in Adani portfolio — 6 are subject to specific sector regulatory review for revenue, costs, and capex.

Meanwhile, in terms of governance, 4 of Adani's large companies are in the top 7% of the peer group in Emerging markets or the sector or the world. On LAS position, Adani said, overall promoter leverage is less than 4% of promoter holding.

Earlier, on January 25, Jugeshinder Singh, Group CFO, Adani said, ""We are shocked that Hindenburg Research has published a report on 24 January 2023 without making any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix. The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless, and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts.""

""The timing of the report’s publication clearly betrays a brazen, mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group’s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming Follow-on Public Offering from Adani Enterprises, the biggest FPO ever in India,"" Singh added.

Also, on January 26, Jatin Jalundhwala, Group Head - Legal, Adani said, ""the maliciously mischievous, unresearched report published by Hindenburg Research on 24 Jan 2023 has adversely affected the Adani Group, our shareholders, and investors. The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens.""

Nevertheless, the panic selloffs in these seven stocks have led to a massive correction in Gautam Adani's net worth. Asia's richest man's wealth is to the tune of $92.7 billion as of January 28. As per Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Adani's net worth has dropped by $20.8 billion at the latest. However, year-to-date, Adani's wealth has dipped by $27.9 billion.","On Friday, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas closed at 20% lower circuits each.
If Adani's FPO is fully subscribed, then this will become the second largest follow-on public offer in India after Coal India's ₹22,558 crore issue in 2015.
Adani companies' debt was also among the key factors that Hindenburg pointed out.

MUMBAI -A $2.5 billion share sale by India's Adani Enterprises remains on schedule at the planned issue price, the company told Reuters on Saturday, while sources said bankers were considering changes due to a market rout in the group's shares.Bankers on the deal were considering extending the sale or cutting the issue price after shares of Adani plunged following a report from a U.S. short seller, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday.Adani Group in a statement said: ""There is no change in either the schedule or the issue price.""""All our stakeholders including bankers and investors have full faith in the FPO (Follow on Public Offer).

NEW DELHI (AP) — Asia’s richest man, Gautam Adani, saw his companies shed $68 billion in market value after short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused him of “pulling the largest con in corporate history,” triggering a massive sell-off of Adani stocks.

The report by from U.S.-based Hindenburg about India’s second-largest conglomerate accused it of stock price manipulation and fraud just as the group began a share offering meant to raise $2.5 billion.

Adani, 60, has since slid from a ranking of being the world’s third richest man to the 11th, as his net worth shrank more than $30 billion to an estimated $84 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.

WHO IS GAUTAM ADANI?

Son of a middle class family in Ahmedabad in western India’s Gujarat state, Adani quit college to become a diamond trader in Mumbai, India’s financial capital. In the 1980s, he started importing plastics before establishing Adani Enterprises, which traded in everything from shoes to buckets and remains his flagship company.

India opened up its economy in the 1990s and a new middle class emerged as tens of millions of people escaped poverty and the economy boomed, prompting Adani to bet on infrastructure and coal.

Adani’s first big project, the Mundra port in Gujarat, opened in 1998 and is now India’s largest. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. is India’s biggest private port operator. Within a decade, Adani became India’s largest developer and operator of coal mines. It has expanded to Australia and Indonesia and, according to Adani Power’s website, is on track to be “one of the largest mining groups in the world.”

Adani companies operate airports in major cities, build roads, generate electricity, manufacture defense equipment, develop agricultural drones, sell cooking oil and run a media outlet. Despite his fossil fuel roots, the billionaire’s Adani Green aims become the world’s largest renewable energy player by 2030.

HOW ADANI BECAME ASIA’S RICHEST MAN

Adani’s net worth shot up about 2,000% in recent years as share prices for his listed companies soared.

His critics say much of his success stems from his close ties to the government and to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has at times campaigned using an Adani jet. They have accused the government of adjusting bidding rules to make it easier for Adani to win contracts to operate airports, for example. The company denies this, saying contracts were won fairly through a transparent process.

Before Modi took office, Adani was friendly with the rival Congress Party, which governed Gujarat state when many of his early projects began. Adani has been “close to every politician in power,” R N Bhaskar, a journalist who wrote a biography on Adani, told The Associated Press.

Adani’s supporters say he has cleverly aligned the group’s priorities with those of the government by investing in key industries like renewable energy, defense and agriculture. And his projects overseas, in strategically important countries like neighboring Sri Lanka, help New Delhi compete with rival Beijing in the region.

WHY HAS THE ADANI GROUP LOST $68 BILLION?

Companies in the Adani Group lost about $68 billion, as estimated by Bloomberg, after Hindenburg Research issued its report last week. The short-selling firm says it spent two years investigating the Adani group and concluded the seven Adani listed companies were overvalued, with an “85% downside risk.” The report cited information from former Adani executives, thousands of documents and other research.

The main allegations against the conglomerate include stock price manipulation and accounting fraud, among other abuses. The report alleges the Adani Group has used offshore shell companies linked to Adani’s family to drive up share prices. It posed 88 questions for Adani to answer.

Five-year-old Hindenburg, run by Nathan Anderson, drew attention in 2020 when it accused electric vehicle maker Nikola of lying and misrepresenting its technology. Nikola’s founder was found guilty of fraud last year.

The Adani group has dismissed Hindenburg’s allegations and issued a 413-page report that rejected its questions, saying none of them were “based on independent or journalistic fact finding.” Adani’s response included documents and data tables and said the group has made all necessary regulatory disclosures and has abided by local laws.

Hindenburg respond by saying Adani had answered only 26 of its 88 questions and failed to address many of the issues it raised.

Adani has said it was considering taking legal action. Hindenburg welcomed the idea, saying a U.S. legal challenge might give it access to documents related to Adani’s business dealings.

HOW TENS OF BILLIONS IN MARKET VALUE VANISHED

Hindenburg’s report raised concerns of wider problems and prompted investors to dump Adani Group shares. Since Jan. 25, the flagship company, Adani Enterprises, and others in the group have plunged by as much as 20% in a single day.

Some analysts said if the issues raised by Hindenburg were found to be true, that could hurt financial institutions and banks the group has borrowed from.

But Aveek Mitra, founder of Aveksat Financial Advisory, says he believes the situation will only cause “a few days of turmoil.” Hindenburg has raised important questions about the valuations of Adani stocks, but it doesn’t mean its entire business or assets are “a sham,” he said.

Adani Enterprises’ share offering was fully subscribed as of late Tuesday, suggesting the company still enjoys support. Still, shares in three Adani companies were down between 5 to 10%.

“If shares continue to plunge, Adani as a businessman will need to take that into consideration and see where and how to next invest,” said Mitra.

“It could also increase scrutiny since lenders may require more assurances which could make the company more careful,” he said. “But whether this is a setback or a temporary blip for Adani, that is the billion dollar question.”","FILE- A motorist rides past Adani Corporate House in Ahmedabad, India, Friday, Jan. 27, 2023.

REUTERS/Amir Cohen















HAIFA, Israel, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Indian magnate Gautam Adani said on Tuesday he would keep investing in Israel after his group took over one of the country's main ports.

The entrance of Adani has spurred Israel's leaders to revive hopes of creating a trade gateway connecting the Mediterranean port of Haifa and the broader Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, which does not have ties with Israel.

Adani spoke at a ceremony in Haifa welcoming Adani Ports (APSE.NS) and local chemicals and logistics group Gadot - the partners who purchased the port for 4 billion shekels ($1.15 billion).

The Indian billionaire did not speak about his group's recent share sale or a scathing short-seller's report that has pummeled his stocks.

""We will transform the entire port landscape,"" Adani said. ""Our intention is to make the right set of investments that will not just make the Adani-Gadot partnership proud, but will make the whole of Israel proud.""

Adani joins China's Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG), which opened in 2021 new piers across the bay in Haifa. The entry of major operators from Asia promises to boost Israel's standing as a regional trade hub.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the ceremony he was working to leverage the investments in Haifa to establish a trade route connecting the Mediterranean and the Gulf, bypassing the Suez Canal.

The idea has been tossed around for years but Israel hopes it became more realistic after normalizing ties with a number of Arab countries in the U.S.-sponsored Abraham Accords.

""We are talking to our Arab neighbours, after the historical Abraham Accords, about connecting the rail links of Saudi Arabia through Jordan to Haifa port,"" Netanyahu said.

""Haifa will become the entry point and exit point for a vast number of goods that will reach the Mediterranean and Europe directly, without having to go around the Arabian peninsula.""

The sale of the Haifa seaport took five years and marks the culmination of a nearly two-decade reform of an underperforming sector plagued for years by labour strikes.

Israel has been selling its state-owned ports and building new private docks in an effort to bring down costs and cut above-average waiting times for vessels to unload.

It has been an excruciating fall. Billions of dollars of market cap got eroded in just two trading sessions. What led to this...,None,"No large shareholder has exited Adani Group; huge promoter debt unsubstantiated speculation, says CFO Jugeshinder Singh","“A lot of large institutional investors are long-term strategic infra, intergenerational investors. They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities -- public companies, nine we have now, are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in India. Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement,” says, Group CFO,I will answer the second part first. Have we seen the exit of any large shareholders? From the data that we have as of the week, the answer is no. A lot of large institutional investors are long-term strategic infra, intergenerational investors. They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities -- public companies, nine we have now, are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in India.Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement. Therefore we do not expect it and neither has there been any movement in the long-term strategic investors and positions.On the first part of the question – yes, we saw short-term volatility and the share prices have consequently changed but again because the fundamental business has not altered in any way, we believe that this volatility will pass. In a week's time, our quarterly results will come out and people will see that the group continues on its upward trend and therefore we believe that over a period of time, it will be seen that we are a core infra utilities platform and therefore on a weekly basis, our cash flows do not alter.So to give you an example here, every week on average, our portfolio makes about Rs 1,100 crore. This Sunday also, that number was achieved. Next Sunday it will be the same, the following Sunday it will be the same. We believe that it will become clear to investors that this short-term volatility will be addressed as we go through over the next few months.As correctly highlighted, even in this report, I could not find anything with assets and performance of our businesses. So, they talk about promoter level debt. We hardly borrow on a corporate basis. At promoter level also, we do not borrow much. At a promoter level, we are net lenders to the market. Therefore, on a corporate basis also, we do not have much debt. On a promoter basis, as I explained, we are net lenders. So it is a completely unsubstantiated speculation that we have huge amounts of debt at promoter level.We are one of the few groups that formally declare total pledge positions on a regular basis quarterly. It goes out as part of our credit report which goes to all investors or banking partners or shareholders, even independent directors. So the informed investor is very clear that we do not have this. This report to that extent is mere speculation on that point of debt.On other aspects, we will discuss but as we go through this period, it has to be recognised and I would like to clarify for the public that for our large companies, say Adani Transmission or Adani Port or Adani Green or Adani Total Gas , their credit profile is similar to that of the government sovereign companies. We are the highest rated infrastructure portfolio in the country with the exception of the Government of India. This has to be seen in that context. We are very comfortable with this and we believe that it is a completely unsubstantiated rumour mongering though it affects us temporarily.False.No, it is nothing to do. Our promoter shareholding is both for India and we hold some of our shares from overseas. In our Holcim transaction, when we issued an open offer document, the entire structure of our overseas holding was fully disclosed. Our domestic holding structure has been disclosed in public documents for investors for the past 12 years.Therefore for anything beyond that, we are fully disclosed in our offering documents for investors, for regulators and for everybody. It is mere speculation and we cannot answer to speculation because this holding structure from family trust, intermediate companies and companies that hold shares domestically, be it Dubai to Mauritius, is fully disclosed in a comprehensive manner. Therefore they have made speculative charges that we control or do not control some company.They raised a specific question. We have addressed this in our rebuttal to that report. Now this is a specific question they asked. They said that in relation to Carmichael Rail and I am aware of this because this is part of AEL, we transferred an asset to a private company and then the private company immediately wrote down the value of their asset. So their implication is we over inflated Adani Enterprise revenue by writing off the asset in a private company. Now this charge is of malicious nature and that is my media statement because I knew this at that point in time also.This is the malicious nature of this report which is borderline lying and it is certainly a misrepresentation. First, we actually disclosed these ourselves that this is a related party transaction. Then we disclosed fully how the transaction was done. Now if somebody claims to have done two years of research, they would have known that this asset when you are transferred, had its accounting treatment known in Adani Enterprise. They could have seen from the same note that in Adani Enterprise, we had already written down the value of the assets and charged it to the P&L as a loss. They knew this and yet they still published this question.I am assuming they know this because they claim to have done two years of research. Now if they did not know this, then it is just purely ignorant and malicious. If they have knowingly done this, it is a case of genuine falsehoods and misrepresentation. So this is a clear example which we have highlighted and we have made public in our response, which is well over 400 pages fully annotated and we have attached the documents so people can verify themselves that 68 out of 88 are these types of questions they have asked.We borrow very little at the promoter level and we declare it and therefore the coverage that we have in relation to that borrowing is we have cash to actually pay the borrowings full stop. Therefore it is completely baseless that there were margin costs. Before margin cost, we will just pay and borrow and completely retire the shareholder loss.The FPO is as you know is a three-part process and we deliberately selected the FPO because we wanted to make sure and achieve certain outcomes; broader institutional participation, broader analyst coverage and actually broader HNI and retail participation.In the current situation or due to the volatility on Friday, the FPO price is below the retail target price. So we expect retail participation. We will wait to see how it goes but the long term investors see the value of the Adani Enterprise differently and they are fully committed for the FPO and we have no information that that has changed.Therefore we are moving ahead because we believe that with our institutional and strategic investor base, the offer will anyway be fully subscribed. Now once and that is why we clarify….that the FPO is proceeding as normal and the reason the confidence comes is because of the way long-term investors look at AEL value. AEL value is not in the share price of AEL. It is just a holding value.The real value of AEL is in incubating assets like Adani Airports, Adani Data Centre business, Adani new industry green hydrogen business, Adani Roads, Adani Digital Labs, Adani Wilmar and mining services business. Those businesses are still performing as they are and they still have the same value. Now that value will be exercised when we demerge this business in the next four to six years.So long-term strategic investors is what they are aiming for and that value has not changed because that is not representative of the AEL. The AEL share price is not representative of that value fully, it is a discounted value. So long-term investors are comfortable with the underlying value. Retail investors will see some pull back but even some ultra HNI and HNI will participate.Correct. Our objective on the retail investor base is twofold; one, we want to spread out the share register which is our objective and which we expect to complete by 2025-2026. Now in the short term, naturally some change will happen because of the possible pullback of retail investors but it is very important for us to understand what we want to do for the retail investor.We are in infra and being an asset-based company, it is very important that the Indian public owns its own assets. It would be good for the person going to Mumbai airport to own some shares because it is their asset, it is the assets of India. Indian public must participate and we want to encourage that participation. It is a bit of a disappointment that there will be some pullback, but in the longer term, we believe our objective to continue to encourage Indian retail investors will pay dividends and the wealth creation that Indian investors, retail investors should enjoy from Indian assets will occur. That is one of the key objectives of our founder and that the public should participate in the wealth creation of hard real assets in the country.Yes, Gujarat Ambuja shares were never pledged and we had clarified at that time also that it was a representation based on the very technical definition that Sebi has; the shares are never pledged. The way the acquisition of that nature is accomplished is that we tell our bankers and debt capital providers that we will hold a minimum number of shares and not the value of shares.So we are not sellers of our equity and we said we will own 63% odd of Ambuja shares which we own. So it is not a loan against shares, not pledged in any way. It is a security package which is different from pledge but that is counted in encumbrance by SEBI and that is why there was some misunderstanding and people misreported that as pledge.It is not for us to give a discount. It is important for us that there is a value equation here and that is based on the sum of parts of real assets being developed. We very carefully evaluated the events of last week and the consensus feedback was that you please go ahead as planned and that is what we are doing.We are in a position where last week we made an EBITDA portfolio level of Rs 1,100 crore. Next week, it would be the same and the week after that, would be the same. We are a non-discretionary consumer spending portfolio. Therefore, underlying businesses are as they are – super high credit quality, massive cash flows and therefore underlying business even their growth trajectory is not impacted by this let alone anything else.","Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement,” says, Group CFO,I will answer the second part first.

Allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud from New York-based investor Hindenburg Research against Adani Group are piling pressure on the Indian conglomerate and its 60-year-old founder. Gautam Adani became Asia’s richest man last year and was second only to Elon Musk in the world at one point. Unlike Musk, Adani is relatively unknown outside his home country. Here’s some background.

1. Who is Gautam Adani? What’s his net worth?

Adani was born to a small textile merchant family in 1962 in the western industrial state of Gujarat. He dropped out of university and began his career sorting diamonds for a firm in the financial hub of Mumbai. He later imported materials used in manufactured goods and by the mid-1990s was managing the Mundra Port, which he now owns. While his net worth took a beating in the days after Hindenburg’s report was published on Jan. 24, he was still in the top 10 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as of late January.

2. How does Adani make money?

Adani Group today comprises half a dozen major companies with interests ranging from energy to transportation and infrastructure development. It’s India’s largest port operator and manages some of the country’s biggest airports. Adani Enterprises, the group’s listed trading house, reported $9.3 billion in sales in the year through March 31, 2022.

3. What are Adani’s companies?

Adani Green Energy Ltd. (Renewable power generation)

Adani Enterprises Ltd. - (Coal mining and trading)

Adani Transmission Ltd. (Power transmission)

Adani Total Gas Ltd. (Gas distribution)

Adani Power Ltd. (Coal-fired power generation)

The Adani Group also runs a real estate business, a shadow banking firm named Adani Capital and an edible oil and food business via a venture with Singapore-based Wilmar International Ltd.

4. What are Adani’s political connections?

The tycoon is seen as closer to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who also hails from Gujarat state, than any other Indian billionaire. Adani’s corporate strategy has run in parallel with Modi’s efforts to develop India’s $3.2 trillion economy. When Modi promised to bring reliable electricity to more Indians, Adani doubled down on coal-fired power production. The alignment extends to foreign affairs. In 2021, Adani began construction of a major port facility in Sri Lanka. Officials from both countries said the plan was encouraged by the Modi government, which wants to curb Chinese influence in the island nation. Whether building expressways or upgrading data centers, Adani can be counted on to provide money, infrastructure, or expertise, whatever the policy priority.

5. What are Hindenburg’s main allegations?

Hindenburg, founded by short-seller Nathan Anderson, issued a 100-page report accusing the Indian conglomerate of using a web of companies in tax havens to inflate revenue and stock prices, even as debt piled up. Among the allegations:

• It identified 38 Mauritius shell entities controlled by Adani’s brother, Vinod Adani, or his close associates plus entities controlled by him in other tax havens.

• The offshore shell network seems to be used for earnings manipulation.

• Adani Group has previously been the focus of four major government investigations relating to allegations of fraud.

• Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas appear to be audited by a tiny firm, with no current website, only four partners and 11 employees, and which has audited just one other listed firm.

• The auditor “hardly seems capable of complex audit work,” it said, when Adani Enterprises alone has 156 subsidiaries and many more joint ventures.

Hindenburg also said it had taken a short position — basically a bet that the stock price would go down — in Adani’s companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivatives. The shares in fact plummeted, erasing tens of billions of dollars in market value from Adani’s flagship.

6. How did Adani respond?

In a rebuttal published Jan. 29, Adani said that it had addressed some 65 of the 88 questions raised by Hindenburg in public disclosures. It described the short seller’s conduct as “nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law.” The group said it would “exercise our rights to pursue remedies to safeguard our stakeholders before all appropriate authorities.” Hindenburg then said Adani’s response ignored all its key allegations and was “obfuscated by nationalism.”

7. What is Hindenburg Research?

Anderson’s firm — technically a research and trading outfit, not a hedge fund with outside investors — is less than five years old and wagers its own money in the markets. Even in Manhattan’s financial circles, Anderson is hardly a big name. The closely held firm specializes in forensic financial research, according to its website. It first attracted Wall Street’s attention in 2020 for raising serious questions about electric-vehicle makers Nikola Corp. and Lordstown Motors Corp.

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani ’s group published a 413-page rebuttal after allegations of fraud by short seller Hindenburg Research erased $51 billion of his flagship firm’s market value.Some 65 of the 88 questions have been addressed in Adani ’s public disclosures and the conduct of the American short seller “is nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law,” Adani Group said in a statement Sunday.

(With inputs from agencies)

Shares of Adani Group companies remained under pressure for the third straight session on Monday with majority of them witnessing a crash yet again.The deepening market rout has now led to losses worth $65 billion in the group's stock values, according to a Reuters report.The current round of fall follows a report by Hindenburg Research last week which flagged concerns about the conglomerates debt levels and the use of tax havens.On Monday, Adani Transmission dropped 14.91%, Adani Green by 20%, Adani Total Gas by 20%, Adani Power by 5%, and Adani Wilmar by 5%.However, shares of flagship Adani Enterprises climbed 4.21% after its follow on public offer (FPO) was subscribed 2%.The developments also had an impact on the stock market which remained volatile during the entire session. Benchmark BSE sensex gyrated nearly 1,000 points intra-day before staging a smart comeback in late trades on selective buying.Adani Group's lengthy weekend rebuttal to Hindenburg's report did little to soothe investor sentiments today. The 3-day selloff has now erased nearly $65 billion market value amid a share sale by Adani’s flagship that was meant to underline the tycoon’s ascension on the global stage.While the Adani Group has portrayed Hindenburg’s allegations as baseless and an attack against India itself, the latter’s report is reviving longstanding investor concerns about the conglomerate’s corporate governance.The saga also threatens to weaken broader confidence in India, until recently a top investment destination for Wall Street, and accelerate a nascent shift toward a reopening China.The selloff is also fast eroding the wealth of Adani, Asia’s richest man, after his stocks were some of the best performers last year not just in the local market, but also on the broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index.From being the 4th richest in the global billionaire rankings till Wednesday last week, Adani has now dropped to the 8th spot with a total net worth of $88.2 billion, as per the Forbes real time billionaires list. However, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows Adani at 7th spot with a wealth of $92.7 billion.This is in sharp contrast to September last year, when Adani's wealth had surged to over $155 billion, making him the 2nd richest person in global billionaires ranking and the first Indian (and Asian) to break into the top 3 list.In a little over two and half years, Gautam Adani 's wealth had galloped over 13 times. In January 2020 just before the onset of Covid pandemic, his net worth was about $10 billion.In 1988, Gautam Adani had set up Adani Enterprises (then Adani Exports) to start a commodities trading business. Soon he set up Mundra port for captive export-import operations. Within a decade it also emerged as the biggest coal trading company in the country and one of India's largest foreign exchange earners.The Adani group had on Sunday slammed the Hindenburg report and likened the damning allegations to a ""calculated attack"" on India, its institutions and growth story, saying the allegations are ""nothing but a lie"".""Needless to say that Hindenburg has created these questions to divert the attention of its target audience while managing its short trades to benefit at the cost of investors,"" the group said.The Gautam Adani-led group also said that the report is selective and manipulative presentation of matters already in public domain to caste a false narrative.They also claimed that the Hindenburg report is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities.Some 65 of the 88 questions posed by Hindenburg are based on Adani’s public disclosures and the conduct of the American short seller ""is nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law,"" Adani Group statement said.The group further reiterated that it will ""exercise rights to pursue remedies to safeguard our stakeholders before all appropriate authorities.""The Adani Group's response comes ahead of the final few days of a $2.5 billion share sale by Adani Enterprises, which received overall subscriptions of 1% on Friday.""Mala fide intention is apparent given its timing when Adani Enterprises is undertaking the largest equity FPO,"" the group stated.US short seller Hindenburg Research rejected Adani Group's charge that its report was an attack on India, saying a ""fraud"" cannot be obfuscated by nationalism or a bloated response that ignored response to key allegations.Commenting on the 413-page response, Hindenburg said it believed India was a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future and it was Adani Group which was holding it back through ""systematic loot"".Hindenburg stood by its last week's report that said its two-year investigation found Adani Group ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"".Hindenburg said the response by the conglomerate run by Asia's richest man Gautam Adani ""opened with the sensationalistic claim that we are the 'Madoffs of Manhattan'.""Hindenburg responded saying Adani Group ""predictably tried to lead the focus away from substantive issues and instead stoked a nationalist narrative.""""Adani Group has attempted to conflate its meteoric rise and the wealth of its chairman, Gautam Adani, with the success of India itself,"" it said.""We disagree. To be clear, we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future. We also believe India's future is being held back by Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation.""Stating that a ""fraud is fraud even when it's perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world,"" it said Adani's '413-page' response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to the report.According to a report by Reuters, state-run Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), India's largest insurer, is reviewing Adani Group's response to scathing criticism by a US short-seller and will hold talks with the group's management within days.""Presently there is a situation that's emerging and we are not sure what is the factual position ... Since we are a large investor, we have the right to ask relevant questions and we will definitely engage with them,"" LIC managing director Raj Kumar told Reuters.LIC says it has invested Rs 36,470 crore ($4.47 billion) in Adani companies, about 1% of its assets under management.""Of course, we are studying the 413-page reply given by Adani Group,"" Kumar said on Monday about the group's response to concerns raised by Hindenburg.""We will also see if the concerns are addressed. If we believe the concerns are not addressed, we will seek further clarification from them.""LIC owned a 4.23% stake in the flagship Adani Enterprises as of end-December, more than 9% in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, nearly 6% in Adani Total Gas and 3.65% in Adani Transmission, data from the Bombay Stock Exchange shows.Dollar bonds issued by entities of Adani Group continued to fall on Monday following a scathing report by a US short seller which triggered a rout in the conglomerate's listed firms.US dollar-denominated bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone continued their fall into a second week with the bond maturing in August 2027 down 5 cents to 73.03 cents, the lowest since June 2020.International bonds issued by Adani Green Energy, Adani Economic Zone, Adani Transmission and Adani Electricity Mumbai also fell.","""The Adani Group's response comes ahead of the final few days of a $2.5 billion share sale by Adani Enterprises, which received overall subscriptions of 1% on Friday.

Related Articles. finance · Top 10 Best Finance Technology Companies In USA 2023.,2023-01-30 09:51:54+05:30,"Airbus Decides To Hire Over 13,000 Employees In 2023","European aircraft maker Airbus said it plans to employ more than 13,000 people worldwide by 2023. The new hires will support the launch of commercial aircraft and address defense, space, and helicopter challenges, the company said in a statement Thursday. The company said roughly 7,000 of those jobs will be newly created positions. More than 9,000 new jobs will be in Europe and the rest within the company’s global network.

New Opportunities At Airbus

The company said the new hires will have the skills to support its long-term projects and maintain its position as a leader in the aerospace industry. The manufacturer said around a quarter of its planned hiring this year will focus on jobs in the areas of decarbonization, digital transformation, software engineering, and cyber technology.

Thierry Baril, director of human resources and the workplace at Airbus, said the company had demonstrated its resilience during the Covid-19 crisis and was now very well positioned for the challenges. Key profiles that Airbus is looking for in its recruitment include digital and cyber, engineering and manufacturing engineering, and customer service. In the aircraft maker manufacturing environment, recruitment opportunities cover areas such as quality, supply chain management, and industrial operations.

Baril said that while expanding its global workforce with new hires, the company will continue to emphasize diversity across the company. The manufacturer said it had already employed the same number of people in 2022 and currently employs more than 130,000 people worldwide.

Investment work

The travel industry has had a tough time during the Covid-19 pandemic, airlines in particular. Covid lockdowns around the world have made it impossible for people to get out of their homes, let alone travel to other countries. This has had a severe impact on airlines, booking sites, and all industries involved. We saw a slight rebound during 2021, but overall spending remained low at $2.9 trillion. This means that for two years running, all companies in the travel industry have seen sales halve, with some being hit harder than others. Airlines have had a hard time with already low margins.

Now in 2022, with Covid largely gone, tourism is back again and the first airlines have reported green numbers in recent quarters. But the good news didn’t last long. In early 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The company is a big player in the production of commercial aircraft, but it also has strong defense and space businesses.

About Airbus

It is a French multinational airline company, the most significant aerospace company based in Europe. It has around 180 branches and 12,000 suppliers worldwide.

Now let’s look more specifically at their divisions:

Commercial aircraft: This is the company’s most significant segment, accounting for just over 30% of revenue in 2021. Airbus is the world’s most significant commercial aircraft maker, just surpassing its close and better-known competitor Boeing (BA).

The industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% by 2027. According to Airbus, the global aviation services market will double by 2041, and the market is expected to recover to pre-covid levels in 2023. According to the firm, the market will reach a total value of $230 billion in 2041. With the company still lagging behind 2019 revenue levels, there is still significant growth to 2023, and growth will remain solid through 2041 thanks to global trends.

Airbus Helicopters: Airbus offers a full range of rotary-wing aircraft solutions for government, civil and military applications. Airbus Helicopters provides services in more than 150 countries worldwide. Airbus helicopters are used very regularly by hospitals as medical helicopters.

Airbus Defense: Airbus supplies high-tech solutions for all areas of defense: land, air, sea, space, and cyber. Airbus makes fighter jets, drones, and satellites. Airbus Defense reports with Airbus space as the segments share many business parts. These segments accounted for 19.5% of total revenues.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, there was an increase in defense spending. A few months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Germany has already said it will provide a defense fund of 100 billion euros to meet its target of 2% of GDP. Airbus is in a weird space in defense because it mainly provides the military with satellite communications and helicopters. It is not active in the arms or missile industry, such as Lockheed Martin (LMT) or L3Harris (LHX).

But these are just two examples of rising defense spending due to the war in Ukraine. It is expected that the longer the war continues, the more countries will need to spend on defense. The spending is an additional windfall for Airbus as it is a significant player in the defense space.

Airbus Space: Airbus supplies Earth observation equipment for world imagery. Navigation is another area where Airbus is a global leader. Airbus is not a spacecraft or rocket builder. It is active mainly in satellite space. He specializes in:

Satellite Navigation, which has all the necessary skills and capabilities to support the successful implementation of satellite navigation systems, provides Navigation and Position.

Financial performance

During 2021, it was the same 297 commercial aircraft deliveries. A bigger difference can be seen in the total orders placed in the first half of both years. During the first half of 2021, Airbus announced total net orders of just 38 aircraft. During the first half of 2022, a total of 259 aircraft orders increased.

It shows us that airlines are reinvesting in their fleet, creating a backlog for Airbus and potential for revenue growth. Until 2019, Airbus grew its annual deliveries at a solid pace, as shown below. People expect total deliveries to be marginally higher by the end of the year compared to 2021 and then pick up into 2023/24 when the supply chain issues also begin to fade.

Airbus has seen an improvement in its order book, which bodes strongly for future quarters and revenue growth. Airbus commercial aircraft net order income (in units) skyrocketed compared to last year, with a 582% higher income. Airbus Helicopters saw a 33% year-on-year increase in net orders (in units), and the total order book grew to 787 helicopters (+17%). Finally, Airbus Defense and Space saw net order intake increase by 86% year-on-year (in euros) to 6.5 billion euros. Of course, these are not products made in a few days, and it will take several years for Airbus to be able to return to its performance in 2019. Still, the strong build-up shows us that growth is coming.

Risks

The risk for Airbus is the threat of a new wave of covid-19, which could impact tourism and slow the recovery again. While people don’t see Covid having the same impact again as it did in 2020 and 2021, it’s still something to keep in mind. Airbus’ backlog also has a large exposure in China after many orders from most Chinese airlines, and it is these that make up a huge chunk of the backlog.

The risk for aircraft manufacturers is technical problems. We have seen this in recent years when Boeing has had many problems and even crashed their planes, and that has been a massive drag on Boeing in recent years. There is an important risk to be aware of when investing in Airbus.

The biggest risk for this aircraft maker appears to be its supply chain issues. It has already said it expects supply chain issues to persist until at least 2023. For a company that has many different suppliers and a huge number of parts, the supply chain is a key part of the business. The company thinks the supply chain problems will subside, but it could take until the end of 2023 for the aviation industry.

Conclusion

This aircraft maker is a diversified company operating in various industries. In the past, it has proven to be relatively resistant to recession and inflation. The company is still struggling with its supply chain and, thus, with its delivery numbers. The order book shows future growth that will explode this year. People expect Airbus to recover significantly over the following few years, regardless of where the economy goes. Yes, growth may slow during the recession due to airline caution, but defense spending will remain strong and even increase.

Individuals see Airbus trading at a P/E of at least 20-25 as growth increases on the back of a recovery, and the company is a haven in uncertain times. The stock is down 30% so far this year, underperforming the S&P 500. With business fundamentals growing and the stock price falling, this presents a good long-term buying opportunity. For this weakness

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday announced that Visakhapatnam will soon be the state capital.

He was addressing representatives of various companies at a curtain raiser event in New Delhi on Tuesday.

The chief minister invited industrialists to Visakhapatnam for the global investors' summit scheduled to be held on March 3 and 4.

""Here I am to invite you to Visakhapatnam, which is going to be our capital, in the days to come. I myself would also be shifting over to Visakhapatnam in the months to come as well,"" said Jagan Mohan Reddy, who is currently running the government from Amaravati.

This is the first time that the chief minister has made a categorical statement about shifting the administrative capital to Visakhapatnam.

Though it was in 2019 that the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government had mooted the idea of three state capitals with Visakhapatnam as the administrative capital, the protest by farmers of Amaravati over shifting of the capital and the High Court order directing the government to develop Amaravati as the state capital had delayed the process.

It was on December 17, 2019 that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had announced in the state Assembly that three state capitals will be developed reversing the decision of the previous TDP government to develop Amaravati as the state capital.

The YSRCP government mooted Visakhapatnam as administrative capital, Kurnool as judicial capital and Amaravati as legislative capital.

This triggered massive protests from farmers of Amaravati, who had given 33,000 acres of land for the capital and the previous government had also undertaken the works on some components of the mega project.

The farmers had organised a padyatra from Amaravti to Tirupati in 2021 to mobilize public support for their demands. They had launched Maha Padyatra from Amaravati to Arasavalli on September 12 last year. It was scheduled to end at Arasavalli on November 12.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

There's an uncomfortable feeling in markets this week that good news may be bad news once again - mainly because of what the former means for this week's big central banking set pieces.

As U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee kicks off its two-day policymaking meeting, the economic news from around the world brightened considerably.

Possibly wary of a premature easing of financial conditions before its tightening campaign is finished, some investors suspect the Fed may want to hang tough for a bit longer - stressing more needs to be done to ensure inflation is licked even as it slows the pace of rate hikes another notch to a quarter point rise on Wednesday.

Another one-two of half point rate rises from the European Central Bank and Bank of England the following day adds to the trepidation, not least with Spain reminding everyone on Monday that inflation rates can re-accelerate again even after peaking.

And if global recession is avoided, the hawkishness may persist. That's why China's new year bounce back from COVID-lockdowns and the euro zone dodging a downturn due to falling energy prices in a warm winter matter so much. They account for the world's second and third biggest economic areas.

China's economic activity swung back to growth in January after three months of contraction, according to official business surveys released on Tuesday.

The euro zone economy confounded forecasts for a quarterly contraction of gross domestic product in the final three months of 2022. Eurostat estimated GDP in the bloc rose 0.1% in Q4 despite consensus expectations for a fall of 0.1%.

And if the significant energy price relief of the past two months means activity picked up further early this year, the long-standing assumptions for a winter euro zone recession will evaporate.

Underlining the point, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday raised its 2023 global growth outlook slightly due to ""surprisingly resilient"" demand in the United States and Europe, easing energy costs and China's reopening.

Dogged by Brexit, tax rises and serial labour strikes, Britain was the clear outlier and is the only G7 nation to have suffered a cut to its 2023 IMF, with the economy set to shrink by 0.6% this year - a sharp downgrade from the prior IMF forecast.

The constellation leaves markets on the back foot as they await the big monetary policy decisions.

Deep in the weeds of the latest corporate earnings season - with more than a fifth of S&P500 firms reporting this week alone and Apple, Amazon and Alphabet all due on Thursday - Wall St stock futures remain in the red after a dour start to the week on Monday. European and Asia bourses were lower too.

The dollar has picked up across the board, with two-year U.S. Treasury yields giving back only some of their gains to near three-week highs on Monday.

Despite the upbeat macro news, China tech stocks (.STAR50) dropped 1.7% on media reports that the Biden administration has stopped approving licenses for U.S. companies to export most items to China's Huawei, signalling new tension in the Sino-U.S. tech war.

UniCredit (CRDI.MI) jumped 8.1% to the top of STOXX 600 after the giant Italian lender pledged to return 5.25 billion euros ($5.69 billion) to investors based on its 2022 results after posting its best profit in more than a decade.

UBS (UBSG.S) shares fell 3% after the Swiss banking giant predicted an ""uncertain"" year ahead plagued by accelerating inflation and higher interest rates - even as it beat estimates, upped its dividend and proposed another $5 billion stock buyback this year.

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's $2.5 billion share sale inched closer to full subscription on Tuesday as investors pumped in funds after a tumultuous week for his group in which its stocks were pummelled by a scathing short-seller report

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:

* U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee starts two-day meeting

* U.S. Q4 employment costs, Jan consumer confidence, Chicago PMI business survey, Dallas Fed services index, Nov house prices

* U.S. corp earnings: Exxon Mobil, Marathon, Pfizer, McDonald's, UPS, Amgen, Caterpillar, AMD, Stryker, Mondelez, Moody's, GM, MSCI, Electronic Arts, Spotify, Snap, Chubb, Western Digital, Juniper Networks, Boston Properties, Edwards Lifesciences, Match, Sysco, Corning, Pentair, Intl Paper, AO Smith, Dover

Gautam Adani's flagship firm called off its $2.5 billion share sale in a dramatic reversal on Wednesday as a rout sparked by a U.S. short-seller's criticisms wiped billions more off the value of the Indian tycoon's stocks.

While announcing the cancellation, he stated that ""the interest of my investors is paramount, and everything else is secondary."" Why was Adani group’s FPO Called off? ET Now report explains it all.Adani Enterprises FPO of Rs 20,000 crore, had given a price band between Rs 3,112 and Rs 3,276. It had already raised an amount of close to Rs 6,000 crore from Anchor investors and close to Rs 3,610 crore rupees from one of the bigger investors, that is IHC(International holding Holding Company). If you look at the subscriptions, you'll notice that the total FPO was subscribed 1.12 times, with the majority of the subscriptions coming from the NII portion, which is nearly 3.32 times oversubscribed.However, the retail portion was very undersubscribed, just 0.12 times. The main reason why this FPO was called off was the sharp fall in the share prices of Adani Enterprises. It should be noted that the Hindenburg report was out on January 24th. If you see the share prices of Adani Enterprises, they are down nearly 38% and compared to the FPO price band of Rs 3,276.

He added that any further financing to the conglomerate's projects would be ""evaluated on its own merit"".

Khara, who was on a post-earnings call, said that the bank does not envisage the tumult-hit conglomerate facing any challenge to service its debt obligations.

“Lending to Adani Group projects is with regard to ones having tangible assets and adequate cash flows,” Khara said on Friday. He added that the group has an excellent repayment record.

""There have been media reports expressing concern about the exposures of Indian banks to a business conglomerate. As the regulator and supervisor, the RBI maintains a constant vigil on the banking sector and on individual banks with a view to maintain financial stability.

Adani Group firms' stocks lost combined market capitalisation of over $100 billion in the past week after US short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report on the group’s activities, where it accused the conglomerate of “stock manipulation and accounting fraud”.

Adani Group companies have lost around Rs 9 lakh crore m-cap in the last seven trading sessions till Friday. The total market capitalisation of the group tanked to Rs 10 lakh crore on February 3, 2023, from Rs 19.2 lakh crore as of January 24, the day Hindenburg Research made its report public.

Adani Power, Adani Total Gas, Adani Wilmar, Adani Green, Adani Transmission, Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises, Ambuja Cements, ACC, and NDTV are the ten listed Adani Group stocks and the shares have crashed up to 50 per cent since last Wednesday.

Hindenburg Research in its report accused the conglomerate of “brazen stock manipulation, money laundering, and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades”. The short seller claimed that the report was summed up after a two-year investigation. Defending itself, the Adani Group called Hindenburg's report ""maliciously mischievous and unresearched"", which, it said, adversely affected the Adani Group, its shareholders, and investors.

On Wednesday, Societe Generale said that the Indian banking sector's direct exposure to the Adani group was just 0.6 per cent. It said markets are ""overpricing"" the risk to Indian lenders of their exposure to the Adani Group and that a selloff in banking shares seemed overdone.

Earlier, Finance Secretary T V Somanathan said that there was no cause for concern for depositors, policyholders, or investors in any PSU banks or LIC amid the latest Adani group stocks rout. He told a news channel that the exposure of SBI and LIC in any company (Adani Group) is far below the level where it should be a concern for investors, Somanathan told the channel.

NEW DELHI — On Wednesday, Indian businessman Gautam Adani lost the title of Asia's richest man. In early January, not only was he the richest in Asia, he was the third-richest in the world and just a few billion shy of Elon Musk. But in the past week, Adani has dropped several places on lists of the world's wealthiest people kept by Forbes and Bloomberg. In a short span of less than 10 days, his personal fortunes have plummeted by close to $50 billion while his firms hemorrhaged around $100 billion in market value.

The reason? He's been accused of ""pulling the largest con in corporate history"" by a U.S.-based short seller, a research firm that bets against Adani's stock prices.

On Jan. 24, Hindenburg Research released a more than 100-page report, alleging that the Adani conglomerate has ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.""

The Adani Group calls the claims ""nothing but a lie.""

On Wednesday, shares of the Adani Group tumbled further as Bloomberg reported that Swiss investment banking company Credit Suisse has stopped accepting the Indian conglomerate's bonds as collateral. The conglomerate, on the same day, also called off a massive $2.5 billion share sale — in a move that further raised eyebrows from investors.

Hindenburg claims it has evidence of ""brazen accounting fraud, stock manipulation and money laundering at Adani."" It has raised concerns over the level of debt in the group's companies and alleges that the conglomerate illegally routed money through shell companies in tax havens like Mauritius. Several of the group's top executives are members of the Adani family, the report notes, creating an environment ripe for opaque financing decisions.

The allegation that Adani stocks were overvalued didn't come as a surprise to Sonam Srivastava, founder of the Indian investment advisory firm Wright Research. But ""the detailed allegations of fraud and market manipulation are pretty horrendous,"" she says.

""It is quite clear that Adani has had very little auditory supervision, almost no coverage by analysts and the regulator has not taken any steps to investigate their business processes or price actions.""

Amol Agrawal, who teaches economics at Ahmedabad University in Gujarat, India, says the Adani episode is ""a major dent on the image of the group, and reputations are very important here.""

Ties with India's leadership

Enlarge this image toggle caption Vijay Soneji/Mint via Getty Images Vijay Soneji/Mint via Getty Images

Adani's businesses span everything from airports and ports to coal and renewable energy and, more recently, media. The 60-year-old tycoon's meteoric rise over the past few years — about $100 billion of his previously estimated $120 billion net worth (before the scandal broke) came about in the last three years or so — coincided with the election and rise of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Observers note that both men hail from the western Indian state of Gujarat, had humble beginnings and have been friends for many years. In 2014, the then-Prime Minister-elect Modi traveled to New Delhi for his inauguration in Adani's plane.

Hindenburg's report has brought the ties between the two men under renewed scrutiny. ""Adani has pulled off this gargantuan feat with the help of enablers in government and a cottage industry of international companies that facilitate these activities. These issues of corruption permeate multiple layers of government,"" the report alleges.

""No smoke without fire""

Hindenburg isn't exposing the alleged scam purely as a public service, however. It holds short positions in the Adani Group, which means that Hindenburg will gain financially if Adani's shares fall. The short seller has a track record of blowing the whistle on corporate fraud around the world, from the United States to China — and profiting from its exposés. In 2022, for example, it accused Trevor Milton, founder and CEO of the electric vehicle company Nikola of making false claims to drive up its share price. Shortly afterward, Milton was found guilty in a U.S. federal court.

""Short sellers have their own games to play, just like the long buyers,"" says Agrawal. ""But there is no smoke without fire.""

Hindenburg was founded in 2017 by Nathan Anderson, a former hedge fund manager who is now among a small group of activist short sellers on Wall Street — traders who make money by shorting, or betting against, big companies. According to a 2021 New York Times profile of Anderson he's turned his passion of ""finding scams"" into a career.

This isn't the first time accusations of fraud have surfaced against Adani.

In 2021, Indian lawmaker Mahua Moitra, who belongs to an opposition party and used to be an investment banker, wrote to the Securities and Exchange Board of India urging an investigation into Adani's alleged use of offshore companies. ""The regulators never took a stand, and the allegations died down,"" says Srivastava, the investment advisory firm founder.

The Adani Group has been the subject of multiple investigations by government agencies but Hindenburg says most of them have been stalled or stonewalled.

""A calculated attack on India""

Agrawal, of Ahmedabad University, also wonders why it took a research firm based in the U.S. to raise such serious questions about the Adani Group. ""There are so many stock market analysts [in India], why is it that they were not seeing what these guys are seeing?"" he asks.

Most market analyses today, he says, are ""buy, buy, buy"" and it points to a wider problem. ""The stock market and the whole financialization of the world economy has moved in a direction where the only thing you want to do is to make sure that stock markets and whatever companies are trading there are constantly going up. Because if anything happens there's a whole fallout.""

On Jan. 29, the Adani Group released a more than 400-page rebuttal to Hindenburg's findings, which it called ""a malicious combination of selective misinformation and concealed facts."" The statement also cited a conflict of interest on Hindenburg's part as a short seller, alleging that the firm had an ulterior motive.

""This is not merely an unwarranted attack on any specific company but a calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India,"" the statement said. The Adani Group said it's also considering suing Hindenburg.

Hindenburg says it welcomes any legal action and that ""fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism.""

""We believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future. We also believe India's future is being held back by the Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation,"" Hindenburg responded.

On Tuesday, Indian newspaper Mint reported that the Adani Group was planning an independent audit of its eight listed firms. India's securities regulator is also increasing scrutiny of Adani's deals, according to Reuters.

The fallout from the Hindenburg report came amid Adani's crucial $2.5 billion follow-on public offer, or secondary share sale, which got a muted response from retail investors but was backed by investors like the Abu Dhabi International Holding Co. It sailed through on Tuesday with full subscription but the conglomerate withdrew it the next day, citing market volatility. ""It wouldn't be morally correct to proceed,"" Adani told investors Thursday.

Agrawal says whether the Adani allegations would have broader implications for India's reputation remains to be seen.

""If this is a one-off case, and it's quickly figured out, then fine, it will not dent India's image,"" he says.

Optimism over easing inflation, nearing of the end of interest rate hike cycle and buying in financial stocks pushed the markets higher. Traders cheered strong earnings for the index heavyweights.

For the day, the 30-share pack BSE Sensex rallied 909.64 points, or 1.52 per cent, to 60,841.88, whereas Nifty50 Index settled at 17,854.05, rising 243.65 points, or 1.38 per cent. However, broader markets underperformed as BSE midcap and smallcap indices settled in red. India VIX dropped sharply about 9 per cent to 14.4-level.

Adani Group's cash stocks continued to bleed as Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy plunged 10 per cent. Adani Power, Adani Total Gas and Adani Wilmar were down 5 per cent each for the day.

However, Adani Enterprises recovered about 55 per cent from day's low to settled 2 per cent lower on Nifty50 but rose over a per cent on BSE. Adani Ports recovered 25% from day's low and settled up to 8 per cent higher.

The markets were already in the grip of a sharp intra-day volatility over the past week or so and hence the recovery was highly anticipated. While banking and auto stocks led the upsurge, weakness in energy, oil & gas and power stocks show the pain continues in the broader market, said Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice President - Technical Research, Kotak Securities

""Technically, for Nifty traders, the immediate hurdle would be the 20-day SMA at 17,950. As long as the index is trading above 17,700, the pullback formation is likely to continue above which it could move up to 18,000. On further upside the index could move up to 18,150. On the flip side, below 17,700 the weak sentiment is likely to accelerate,"" he said.

On a sectoral front, Nifty PSU bank index soared 3 per cent, whereas financial services and private bank indices were up 2 per cent each. Auto index added over a per cent. Among the losers, pharma and reality indices dropped a per cent each, with metal and media indices being other key laggards.

Barring the Adani Group stocks, Titan surged 7 per cent, most among the Nifty50 index. Bajaj Fiserv and Bajaj Finance jumped 5 per cent each, whereas HDFC, State Bank of India, HDFC, Either Motors, IndusInd Bank and Mahindra & Mahindra gained 3 per cent each.

Among the losers, Divis Labs bled 12 per cent after poor results in December 2022 quarter. Bharat Petroleum and Tata Consumer were down 2 per cent each, whereas Hindalco, HDFC Life and Wipro were other key laggards in the index.

Domestic equities are also rising as a result of dovish comments from global central banks. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) followed suit a day later after the United States Federal Reserve acknowledged in its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday that the disinflationary process may have begun, said Choice Broking in its note.

""At its policy meeting on February 8, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to raise the key policy repo rate by 25 basis points, signaling the end of a nearly year-long tightening cycle. We expect the market to be quite volatile. We advise you to use a stock-specific method,"" it said.

The development came even as S&P Dow Jones said it would drop Adani Enterprises from sustainability indices and the NSE put two Adani Group stocks under a futures and options (F&O) ban on Friday.

The group has incurred a $120 billion loss in market value since the Hindenburg report levelled a litany of charges - including fraud and share price manipulation. The Adani Group however insists that that allegations are baseless, and that it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

What is an ASM framework?

ASM or ‘additional surveillance measure’ framework is a pre-emptive measure taken to enhance ‘market integrity and safeguard the interest of investors’. Both the BSE and NSE have taken this step as per data available with the exchanges on Thursday.

Simply put, the stocks will now be subject to greater scrutiny and restrictions. Their listing under ASM is a warning of sorts for investors about unusual price movement. They cannot be pledged and are also forbidden from intraday leverages like cover orders and bracket orders. Measures such as reduction in price band, periodic call auction, and transfer of securities to Trade for Trade segment from time to time can also apply.

The parameters for shortlisting securities under ASM include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close-to-close price variation and price-earning ratio. The move is not intended as adverse action against the concerned company or entity and is purely on account of market surveillance.

Which Adani companies have been put under ASM framework?

The NSE has put Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone and Ambuja Cements under their short-term additional surveillance measure framework.

What does it mean for these Adani companies?

The NSE and BSE have said that these three companies satisfied the criteria for inclusion in short-term ASM.

“Applicable rate of margin shall be 50% or existing margin whichever is higher, subject to maximum rate of margin capped at 100%, with effect from February 6, 2023 on all open positions as on February 3, 2023 and new positions created from February 6, 2023,"" the bourses said under the short-term ASM.

Market experts believe that putting in this framework means intra-day trading would require 100% upfront margin.

How long can short term ASM last?

According to an FAQ sheet uploaded to the official BSE website, “The stocks shall be retained in each stage as applicable for a minimum period of 5/15 trading days and shall be eligible for review from 6th/16th trading day onwards.""

A stock can be moved out of the short term ASM framework if it does not meet the entry criteria on the review date.

“There is a risk that investor concerns about the group’s governance and disclosures are larger than we have currently factored into our ratings, or that new investigations and negative market sentiment may lead to increased cost of capital and reduce funding access for rated entities,” said S&P.

‘Adverse developments’

Earlier in the day, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that it would remove Adani Enterprises from its widely used sustainability indices with effect from February 7. “Adani Enterprises will be removed from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices following a media and stakeholder analysis triggered by allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud,” said the announcement.

Within hours, Moody’s Investors Service put out a note stating that adverse developments are likely to reduce Adani group’s ability to raise capital to fund committed capex or refinance maturing debt over the next 1-2 years.

Assuaging concerns

Meanwhile, both the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India stepped in to assuage concerns over the possibility of a contagion effect arising out of the developments around the group. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the country’s markets were well-regulated. “One instance, however much talked about globally, I would think is not going to be indicative of how well Indian financial markets have been governed,” said Sitharaman.

The RBI said the banking sector remains resilient and stable in the backdrop of reports about Indian banks’ exposure to Adani group even as the chiefs of top public sector banks stated that their exposure to the conglomerate is well within regulatory limits.

With a fall of 56 per cent, Adani Total Gas plunged the most in the past six trading sessions till February 2. Shares of the company dropped to Rs 1,711.50 on Thursday from Rs 3,885.45 on January 24, 2023.

Other group stocks including Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Transmission, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Ambuja Cements, Adani Wilmar, Adani Power, New Delhi Television and ACC also declined somewhere between 21 per cent and 54 per cent during the same period.

Data available with Ace Equity showed that the six-day average absolute deliverable volumes of Adani Enterprises soared to 27 lakh shares till February 2 as compared with the six-day average of 5.84 lakh between January 17, 2023 and January 24, 2023. However, six-day average deliverable volumes in terms of percentage declined to 17.79 per cent from 25.21 per cent during the same period.

Likewise, the average six-day deliverables volume of Adani Power jumped to 30.82 lakh shares from an average of 8.90 lakh shares (Jan 17-Jan 24). Average deliverable volumes of Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, Adani Wilmar and Adani Total Gas also spiked 680 per cent, 452 per cent, 199 per cent, 229 per cent and 154 per cent, respectively, during the same period.

While decoding the substantial rise in average deliverable volumes, Milan Vaishnav, Founder, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory said that delivery volumes are a technical input. It denotes the number of (or percentage) of a stock that is marked for either taking or giving a delivery. It means that it is not a trading volume.

For example, if the total traded volumes in a particular stock is 1,00,000 and delivery volumes are either 45,000 shares or 45 per cent -- then it would mean that out of the total 1,00,000 shares that were traded, 45,000 or 45 per cent quantity will actually get delivered. In the case of Adani Total Gas, the six-day average deliverable volume in terms percentage stood at 52.55 per cent till February 2 compared with 33.61 per cent six-day average deliverable volume (Jan 17-Jan 24).

“It is important to correctly interpret delivery volumes, they are read along with the price move. High and above average delivery volumes with price rise is a bullish sign. Similarly, if there are high delivery volumes along with a decline in price is bearish,” Vaishnav said.

“I think very high risk appetite investors are doing bottom fishing in select Adani group of stocks in a staggered manner with a long term view. However, there is no confirmation of bottom as yet,” said Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist, WealthMills Securities.

The six-day average deliverable volume of cement majors ACC and Ambuja Cements also climbed 912 per cent and 1,850 per cent, respectively, during the same period.

It was a rough ride on Dalal Street. The market initially gave a thumbs up to the Budget proposals on Wednesday and pushed the sensex up by over 1,200 points soon after the FM’s speech was over with the index nearing the 61k mark. However, strong selling in Adani stocks affected trade sentiment in mid-session and brought the whole market down after a report said that Credit Suisse had stopped accepting bonds issued by the group companies as collateral. As a result, the index dived nearly 2,000 points from the day’s high. However, bargain hunting late in the session, mainly by foreign portfolio investors, helped the sensex close with a modest gain of 158 points at 59,708 points.According to Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund MD Nilesh Shah, through the Budget proposals, the FM aims to achieve fiscal prudence with lower deficit and the path has been set till FY26. “Consumption is supported through tax cuts. Investment outlay is enhanced. Budget numbers are realistic to enhance the (government’s) credibility,” Shah said. “The Budget could have focused more on asset monetisation but that can be pursued otherwise also depending upon market conditions,” he added.During the day, FPIs turned net buyers after selling aggressively in the three previous sessions, during which they had net sold stocks over $2 billion. During the day’s session, foreign funds were net buyers at Rs 1,785 crore, BSE data showed. Domestic funds too were net buyers with a net inflow figure of Rs 529 crore.According to HDFC Securities MD Dhiraj Relli, market players were happy since it was a growth-oriented Budget and the way the finance minister clearly spelt out the maths behind the proposals. The FM also didn’t have any proposal that was negative for any sector except for insurance, he said.“Fear and concerns related to the Budget that exist in the run-up to any Budget is behind the market and hence we saw a relief rally soon after the FM’s speech was over,” Relli said. “I expect the government’s capex plans would be front-loaded,” he said.Although D-Street investors were bullish about the long-term impact of the Budget and blue chips closed with gains, strong selling was visible outside of the index stocks. As a result, the selling left investors poorer by nearly Rs 4 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 270 lakh crore.One sector that was hit hard by the Budget was life insurance. To plug a tax loophole that was being used by rich investors to enjoy tax arbitrage, the FM imposed a tax on returns from some savings products sold by life insurance companies. As a result, HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance lost 11% each, Max Financial lost 10%, SBI Life lost 9%, while LIC closed with an 8% loss.According to Relli, the sharp drop in stock prices of these companies was a knee-jerk reaction to the FM’s proposals. “These stocks are now being re-rated and some of these companies would now need to have a re-look at their business model.”One of the notable gainers in the stock market was ITC, which gained despite the Budget proposing a marginal rise in one of the cesses that cigarette companies pay. The stock gained 2.6% to close at Rs 361, a life-high level. Other sensex gainers included Tata Steel , ICICI Bank and TCS , while the laggards included Bajaj Finserve , SBI and IndusInd Bank.In the forex market, the rupee continued to weaken, mainly on the back of the massive FPI selloff in the stock market in the last few sessions. As a result, the rupee closed at 81.93 to the dollar, weaker by 43 paise over the day.For Thursday, two developments will decide the market’s trend. The late Wednesday decision by the Adani Group to call off its Rs 20,000-crore FPO is expected to have some major impact on the stock market, especially the group’s stocks.Second, late on Wednesday the US Federal Reserve is set to announce its decision on interest rates in the world’s largest economy.Thanks to a massive 28. 5% slide in the Adani Enterprises stock in Wednesday’s session, investors who had bailed out its Rs 20,000-crore follow-on public offer (FPO) were already staring at a loss of nearly 32% on their investment. The extreme volatility led to the company’s decision late on Wednesday night to call off the entire offer.On the BSE, Adani Enterprises closed at Rs 2,129, a 31. 6% discount to the lower limit of the FPO price band of Rs 3,111-3,276. Plus, stock prices of all the other nine Adani companies also closed lower after a report said that Credit Suisse, one Europe’s major banks, had stopped accepting bonds issued by the group companies as collateral. They also valued these bonds at nil.Most group stocks hit the lower circuit level and closed around that mark. The slide had started on January 25 after a US-based short-seller Hindenburg releaseda report about the group, alleging corporate fraud and stock manipulation. Adani Group denied any such corporate malfeasance and in turn accused Hindenburg of having ulterior motives.","However, strong selling in Adani stocks affected trade sentiment in mid-session and brought the whole market down after a report said that Credit Suisse had stopped accepting bonds issued by the group companies as collateral.

SBI’s exposure includes $200 million from its overseas units, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Dinesh Kumar Khara, chairman of SBI, said earlier on Thursday the Adani Group companies were servicing the loans and he doesn’t see an “immediate challenge"" to whatever the bank has lent so far.

The Reserve Bank of India, the nation’s banking regulator, had asked lenders for details of their exposure to the conglomerate following a rout in group companies’ stock prices, Bloomberg News reported earlier Thursday.

A representative for SBI didn’t respond to an email seeking comment on the exposure.

The exposure by various financiers to companies controlled by Gautam Adani has come under increasing scrutiny after their shares plunged following a scathing report from US-based Hindenburg Research. Wealth units of Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. have stopped accepting securities from the group as collateral for margin loans to their clients, Bloomberg News reported earlier.

Adani has repeatedly denied the allegations and called the report “bogus,"" and threatened legal action.

Other domestic banks are also confident the Indian group can service its loans.

State-run Punjab National Bank’s exposure to Adani companies was 70 billion rupees, Atul Goel, its chief executive, told reporters last month. About a third of it was to Adani’s airport business and cash-flows back the entire advances, Goel said.

Private sector IDFC First Bank Ltd. said in an exchange filing on Thursday that the funded outstanding exposure to the Adani Group was less than 0.1% of its total loans. Meanwhile, IndusInd Bank Ltd. with a loan book of 29 trillion rupees said its exposure to the conglomerate accounted for 0.5% of its loan book.

IFR,,Focus shifts to Adani debt refinancing,https://www.ifre.com/story/3728695/focus-shifts-to-adani-debt-refinancing-8xbqnjxjrj,The acquisition financing helped Adani companies acquire controlling stakes in Ambuja Cement and ACC in September from Holcim. The group began discussions in...,None,Focus shifts to Adani debt refinancing,"Adani Group’s abrupt decision on Wednesday to call off what was to be India’s largest follow-on public offering has brought back the spotlight on a US$5.25bn borrowing that funded its purchase of a controlling stake in Swiss building materials firm Holcim’s cement businesses in India last year.

A stinging report from short-seller Hindenburg Research, which criticised the group for its high debt levels and accused it of misusing offshore entities in tax havens, led to steep slides in the shares of the group's seven listed companies and a Rs200bn (US$2.45bn) follow-on for Adani Enterprises was pulled on Wednesday, despite being fully subscribed.

The acquisition financing helped Adani companies acquire controlling stakes in Ambuja Cement and ACC in September from Holcim. The group began discussions in September with lenders to raise up to US$4bn through a three-year term loan to refinance the M&A bridge loans as well as a portion of a US$1bn two-year mezzanine financing that also funded the acquisition of the cement businesses. The existing financing includes a US$500m six-month cash bridge due in March and a US$3bn 18-month piece maturing a year later.

Sources say the US$500m six-month bridge loan will be grouped into the take-out facility, which puts the group under pressure to wrap up the refinancing by next month. Failing that, it would have to extend it – something that would send a negative signal to the market in the light of the share price collapse.

Liquidity and refinancing risks are key for the Adani companies, but debt bankers insisted they aren’t too worried – at least for now.

A senior banker in Singapore said those risks were manageable. “The underlying businesses of ports, airports, power and cement are synonymous with the India infrastructure story and are well-performing, cashflow-generating companies. Of course, earlier plans that were being considered for the debt refinancing will need to be recalibrated in light of recent developments, but credit exposure to the operating companies of the group is not an issue,” he said.

A credit research analyst at an asset management firm in Singapore shared similar views, saying: “we do not foresee a default risk on interest payments in the coming months, because most of the operating entities of Adani Group have decent cash, the group has good assets to divest, and highly leveraged entities like Adani Green Energy can reduce capex plans.”

Reviewing the situation

Adani Group’s founder Gautam Adani, in a video address on Thursday, said: “Our Ebitda levels and cashflows have been very strong and we have an impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations. We will continue to focus on long-term value creation and growth will be managed by our internal accruals. Once the market stabilises, we will review our capital markets strategy.”

Less than a third of the proceeds of the follow-on were intended to repay debt at Adani Enterprises and its unlisted subsidiaries.

The group is known to have several share-backed loans, though bankers declined to disclose whether steep declines in Adani companies' share prices had triggered margin calls.

A US$750m two-year share-backed financing at a holding company level made up the remainder of the US$5.25bn debt funding package that helped the Adani empire acquire the stakes in Ambuja Cement and ACC. As at the end of December, Adani companies held 63.15% in Ambuja Cement and a 56.69% stake in ACC.

“For the US$750m holdco level loan, Adani has plenty of room to top up more shares as collateral despite the recent significant drop in their prices,"" said the banker in Singapore. ""Fortunately for Adani, there is no maturity wall coming up this year.”

Bloodbath

The group has Rs140bn of debt maturing during the 2023 and 2024 financial years, according to Care Ratings, and had combined liquidity of Rs260bn as of December 31.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone and Adani Green Energy have a total of US$1.9bn in principal amount of bonds coming up for refinancing next year.

The Hindenburg report and the subsequent cancellation of the follow-on offer sent prices for Adani companies' US dollar bonds lower by between 12 and 34 points.

Adani Ports' US$650m 3.375% notes due July 24 2024 slumped to 84 cents to yield 15.80% as of Friday, according to Refinitiv data, having traded at a yield of 6.10% before Hindenburg's report was released. Adani Green Energy’s US$750m 4.375% holdco notes maturing on September 8 2024 sank to 61 cents to yield 39.70% and the US$500m 6.25% notes due December 10 2024 for Adani Green Energy's project companies fell to 87.10 cents to yield 14.40%. Adani Transmission's US$500m 4% August 2026 bonds fell to 74.60 cents to yield 13.30%.

“It is difficult for the prices of existing bonds to return to pre-saga levels, due to investor aversion and potential event risks,” said Leonard Law, a senior credit analyst at Lucror Analytics. “Hence, the bonds will likely continue to yield a premium to Indian corporate peers for some time.”

The biggest risk is if the Adani companies faces a severe deterioration in access to financing, particularly at its highly leveraged entities. “A liquidity crunch at any one of the entities may have a ripple effect on financing access for the wider group,” Law said. “The group can likely continue to raise funds from onshore banks and bonds for now.”

The three major credit ratings agencies rate Adani Ports Baa3/BBB–/BBB–, all with stable outlooks. On Friday, Moody's said the adverse developments are likely to reduce Adani Group's ability to raise capital to fund committed capex or refinance maturing debt over the next one to two years, although it noted that some capex is deferrable and rated Adani entities do not have significant maturing debt until 2024. Fitch said there was no immediate impact on the Adani entities that it rates and it expects no material changes to forecast cashflow.

Most bondholders and analysts are confident Adani Ports can refinance the US$650m bonds up for refinancing in July 2024. According to a Lucror note on Thursday, the company could issue “new offshore bonds (albeit at a high yield premium), or repay using a combination of internal free cashflows (after reducing capex), onshore bank and bonds, and raising new equity”.

Another senior banker in Singapore said: “The past few days have been like watching a Netflix movie with every day bringing a new development. Cancelling the [follow-on offer] was the right thing to do, but some form of equity raising is important for Adani to prove that it enjoys long-term support and is serious about deleveraging. Equity is important from the standpoints of perception, confidence and investors and will go some way in comforting lenders and bondholders.”

Ambuja Cements fell 20 per cent to Rs 320.80. ACC, on the other hand, declined 11.13 per cent to Rs 1,750. This is amid a Bloomberg report suggesting that Credit Suisse Group AG has stopped accepting bonds of Gautam Adani’s group of companies as collateral for margin loans to its private banking clients, a sign that scrutiny of the Indian tycoon’s finances is growing after allegations of fraud by short seller Hindenburg Research.

The Bloomberg report suggested that Swiss lender’s private banking arm has assigned a zero lending value for notes sold by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Green Energy and Adani Electricity Mumbai, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. It had previously offered a lending value of about 75 per cent for the Adani Ports notes, one of the people told Bloomberg.

Other banks continue to lend against Adani debt, the Bloomberg report suggested. At least two European private banks kept the level unchanged as of now, with one of those offering lending of between 75 per cent and 80 per cent for Adani Ports dollar bonds, according to the people.

He said that retail investors should not suffer and that the Adani Group shares will continue to tank for a few weeks. Salve’s comments come at a time when Adani Group is battling a rout in its stocks due to the scathing report by the US-based short-selling firm Hindenburg Research.

Salve, who is also a practicing Supreme Court advocate, told India Today’s Rajdeep Sardesai: “He has done a wonderful thing by withdrawing the FPO because the retail investor should not suffer. For the next few weeks, the shares will tank. They will try and control it, but the shares will tank. These allegations will be investigated and thrown out in some time and confidence will be rebuilt. But in the meantime, Hindenburg gets away with it.”

He stated: “Till the time the market continues in this volatile condition, there is bound to be an erosion of confidence. It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and trust, and a moment to destroy it.”

On Thursday, Gautam Adani announced that the company board felt it was not morally right to go ahead with the Rs 20,000 crore FPO issue due to market volatility on Budget day. He added that the interest of investors is paramount and everything else follows thereafter.

He said, “After a fully subscribed FPO, the decision of its withdrawal would have surprised many. But considering the volatility of the market seen yesterday, the board strongly felt that it would not be morally correct to proceed with the FPO.”

During the course of this interview, Salve also took a jibe at the US-based short-selling firm and said some people like making money by leveling such allegations. He further noted that Gautam Adani’s grandchildren will fight the case if the Group sues Hindenburg for damages.

Salve said: “Where India lacks is that in India, we don’t have the legal framework to take on a Hindenburg. If we sue them for damages, Gautam Adani’s grandchildren will be fighting the case.”

Meanwhile, nine companies of the Adani Group have lost $107 billion in market cap after six straight sessions of a blood bath at Dalal Street or nearly 45 per cent.

An eternity for TV. The wealthy and powerful hold our attention.

On the flip side, we’re also fascinated when they fall. For example, many enjoy seeing a billionaire’s net worth drop. Similarly, people love David and Goliath stories, when a small person or entity overtakes a huge obstacle.

Some of those elements are part of this month’s Crisis Averted examples. The incidents below also touch on reputation, the power of words and the value of good communication.

Power of Words

Just days ago, school dropout Gautam Adani was Asia’s richest person and one of the planet’s wealthiest people. The 60-year-old still is a billionaire and his name is ubiquitous in India. Yet in the past few days his companies and net worth have dropped like a lead zeppelin. His personal worth is off $50 billion, Adani Group is down twice that.

Indeed, it’s a zeppelin that’s prompted the losses. In reality it’s a small, NYC short-seller named for a zeppelin, Hindenburg Research.

Investors fear allegations in Hindenburg’s 104-page report about some of Adani's companies are correct. The Jan. 24 report alleges the Indian mogul and his businesses, Adani Enterprises, illegally manipulate markets. Moreover, it claims Adani companies are opaque about much of what they do.

Hindenburg doesn't mince words, saying Adani is pulling ""the largest con in corporate history.""

Of course, anyone can spew claims, yet Hindenburg isn’t just anyone. Exposing business fraud in companies it’s invested in is what Hindenburg does. In addition, when Hindenburg makes allegations, it simultaneously unloads assets in the company it’s targeting.

A Strong Reputation

Importantly, Hindenburg’s reputation is strong. “I researched [Hindenburg] and didn’t find anyone litigating successfully against its reports,” says crisis pro Eric Rose, a partner at EKA. “They’ve been right every time,” he adds.

For example, a few years back, Hindenburg alleged the CEO of Nikola, a developer of alternative energy trucks, was making false claims about its technological prowess. In other words, Nikola’s tech wasn’t as good as CEO Trevor Milton claimed it was.

Hindenburg was correct. As a result of Hindenburg’s report, Nikola’s finances and reputation were walloped. And Milton was convicted of 3 fraud counts. He’s awaiting sentencing.

Similarly, Mr. Adani and his companies are suffering financially and reputation-wise in the wake of Hindenburg’s report. Still, Adani Enterprises had enough market juice for a successful $2.5 billion follow-on public offering (FPO) Jan. 31, days after Hindenburg's report went public.

Or so we thought.

FPO Cancelled

As we went to press today (Feb. 1), Adani Enterprises nixed the FPO. “Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility the company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction,” Adani Enterpises said.

Just the day before (Jan. 31), the FPO's perceived success was, for some, indication Adani's crisis was averted.

Yet a closer look at the FPO shows the bulk of subscribers were large institutions, from India and Abu Dhabi. These organizations apparently were attempting to show support for Adani. Retail investors were just 12% of FPO subscribers.

It's reported that Adani is a close friend of India's prime minister Narendra Modi, which could explain the country's support in the FPO and that of other nations. For crisis consultant Nathan Miller, CEO, Miller ink, these displays of country support ""occur at a very high level...well outside the public eye...it's a case of geopolitics meets finance.""

The Responses

Adani didn't take Hindenburg's report lightly. Just days after Hindenburg branded Adani a fraud, Adani’s businesses responded. One tactic was an attempt at deflection. A statement argued Hindenburg was doing more than targeting Adani, it was attacking India.

Yet the largest response came from a 413-page mammoth report that Rose calls “gobbledygook.” It was a hastily assembled “data dump” of photocopied court documents that did little to combat allegations, he argues. “For years, PR textbooks will use it as an example of how not to respond,” Rose predicts.

Instead, he argues, Adani should have used bullet points, briefly listing allegations and responding with facts. “It should have been 4 pages.”

[Update, Feb. 2, 3pm ET: Adani posted a video statement late yesterday. It was his first mention of falling values in his companies. During the 4-minute video, he says investors are his main concern. Meanwhile, shares in Adani's companies continued falling today.]

Not a Crisis

Despite the FPO's cancellation and Hindenburg's report, “there’s no existential threat” to Adani's empire, Rose says. A true PR crisis is something that potentially could ""end"" a business, he argues. “There was never any chance of that.”

“What he has is a smoldering fire around his reputation that could last for years,” Rose adds. Adani “is still a billionaire…falling a few slots on Forbes’ billionaire list is a first-world problem.”

Adani’s real worry is what, if anything, New Delhi does as a result of Hindenburg’s claims. “In a sense, the Indian regulatory regime hangs in the balance,” Rose says.

Miller agrees Adani will need to do ""a lot of [reputation] work...this is going to be a legacy challenge...the stink of this report remains.”

In addition, Miller puts the Adani-Hindenburg episode to one side. He believes Hindenburg's work is sound. Allegations in Hindenburg's report aren't obscure, he says, ""they were well-known before the report came out."" These include the companies' heavy debt load.

On the other hand, he notes ""there's an army of people using [disinformation on] social media to manipulate markets."" Eventually, he says, information warfare ""is going to be a challenge for every single publicly traded company.""

At the moment, the odds aren't with companies. ""The people deploying these kinds of strategies are far ahead of the publicly traded companies."" He adds, ""it's never been easier for people to manipulate stocks in really destructive ways.""

PagerDuty's Blunder

Sadly, there've been so many tech layoffs lately, it's hard to keep track.

Yet you likely know of Jennifer Tejada, CEO of tech firm PagerDuty and the inappropriate way she announced a lay off of 7% of its workers Jan. 24.

Everyone knows. Rose says a tool he used found more than 400 mentions of Tejada's 1,700-word layoff email, which addressed employees as ""Dutonians,"" also included verbiage about promotions. Moreover, it used corporate-ese, labelling layoffs ""refinements"" and quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in an awkward way.

Again, as you might know, Tejada's 'style' was destroyed on social and elsewhere in the media.

What's Next?

However, you might not know Tejada apologized, three days later. It received less coverage. That said, have Tejada and PagerDuty moved on? Was their crisis averted? Was it a PR crisis at all?

Rose and Miller don’t label it a crisis. “It wasn’t catastrophic,” Rose believes, yet they agree it was severe.

The way she laid off people “was not a mistake…a slip of the tongue or a quote taken out of context…it was composed and calculated...there's no excuse for this kind of communication,” Rose says.

Similarly, Miller says Tejada's email was ""weird"" and ""is a symptom of a broader communication problem."" He adds, ""some CEOs don't know how to address people with empathy...and they're so isolated nobody calls them out on it...[Tejada's] not alone in this.""

As such, the PagerDuty case might not be a situation where ""the chief bungled one."" Instead, he says, the company may lack a communication function. Without it, Tejada ""may not [communicate correctly] ever.""

No Apology without Pressure?

Would Tejada have apologized without receiving a plethora of negative media coverage? No, Miller and Rose say.

However, that could be a high standard. “Many people lack the introspection to apologize because they think they were at fault, most do so under pressure,” says Dr. Kerry O'Grady, faculty director and associate professor of practice, PR and corporate communications, Georgetown University School of Continuing Education.

Yet apologize is what Tejada should do whenever the incident is mentioned, Rose believes. ""People are very forgiving when you admit you were wrong and your apology is sincere,"" he adds.

In addition, Tejada must work on the why, he says. Understand “why she behaved as she did.”

Accordingly, Tejada ""should do something privately to start to connect with the people she offended,” Rose advises. Essentially, go into a type of rehab. “Reach out to people so she has a better understanding of how insensitive her comments were.”

She doesn't have to promote the rehabbing, Rose says. “People will talk about it,” he says.

Though “time heals these sorts of wounds,” the incident will never really end, Rose argues. “The internet is unforgiving…it lives forever…the best Tejada can do is create better [news], that pushes down” stories about her bad email in search rankings.

Adding more, he said that his government has reintroduced the old pension scheme as funds under the new scheme were invested in shares and was of the opinion that the old pension scheme (OPS) should be reintroduced in the entire nation.

Asking the Centre to return the funds of the state government employees deposited in the new pension scheme (NPS), Gehlot added that his state government will move the Supreme Court.

""Employees are our brothers and we cannot leave them to the mercy of the share market. Shares of Adani Saab have fallen and there is a turmoil in the entire country and abroad. Shares of those who have given loans (to Adani group) have fallen including SBI and LIC,"" Gehlot said.

According to Gehlot, the the entire NPS fund is being pumped into the share market. He added that this argument was given by the state government when it implemented the old pension scheme (OPS) in the state.

The Rajhasthan CM also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should answer why he wants NPS to continue.

""I would like to say again that the entire House should unite to talk about it. OPS will have to be implemented - today or tomorrow. The Centre is not giving us our money deposited in the NPS. It is our money. If they will not give, then we will move the Supreme Court,"" Gehlot said.

On the issue of divisions in the party, the state CM rebuffed the leader of the opposition's claim and said there cannot be a bigger lie than the claim that the NDA government takes all religions and castes together.

""This is the issue of our party. This is what Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra campaign is all about...there should be peace, brotherhood and love in the country. This is our thinking. We think that Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains should all remain united in the country,"" the senior Congress leader said.

He said there is not a single Muslim member from the BJP in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

""What kind of democracy do you talk about, do you have democratic thinking? There is a 20 per cent population of such a big religion and your party did not give a single ticket. It neither gave a ticket in Lok Sabha nor in Uttar Pradesh. It did not allow any Muslim to enter Rajya Sabha (on its ticket). How can you say that you take everyone along,"" he said targeting the opposition BJP.

The Budget Session of the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly began on January 23. Gehlot will present the budget for the financial year 2023-24 on February 10.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Hundreds of demonstrators from India’s main opposition party turned out Monday in India’s capital New Delhi and other cities demanding an investigation into allegations of fraud and stock price manipulation by India’s second-biggest business group, headed by coal mining tycoon Gautam Adani.

The Adani Group said Monday that its major investors, known in India as “promoters,” had pledged to prepay $1.1 billion in share-backed loans due for repayment by September 2024. The repayments include shares in Adani’s ports business, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission.

Shares in Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone jumped 9% after the announcement.

In New Delhi, Congress Party workers threw fake currency notes in the air and chanted slogans. Some burnt a suitcase plastered with images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adani. Some protesters scaled police barricades and were detained and taken away in police vans.

Opposition party workers in the financial capital, Mumbai, and in the southern city of Chennai gathered outside the offices of a state-run bank and the country’s largest insurer, which known to have investments in Adani shares.

So far, there is no sign the fracas was spreading across India’s financial sector and the protests are more a reflection of political theater rather than spontaneous public outrage. Lawmakers disrupted Parliament proceedings for a third day on Monday as calls mounted for India’s market regulator to look into Hindenburg’s claims.

Adani and his companies have lost tens of billions of dollars as investors dumped their shares. Last week, the Adani Group cancelled a $2.5 billion share offering, promising to provide refunds to investors.

The billionaire’s fortune had swelled by more than 2,000% in recent years. Critics say he has benefited from strong relationships with Modi and his government, while others point out he also prospered under previous administrations.

“What action has been taken, if ever, to investigate the serious allegations made over the years against the Adani Group?” Jairam Ramesh, the Congress Party’s general secretary, said in a statement issued over the weekend. “Is there any hope of a fair and impartial investigation under you?” he said in a reference to Modi.

Shares in Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship, wobbled Monday and were down 2.1% by mid-afternoon Monday. Its market value has shrunk by more than 50% since the Hindenburg report. Stock in five other Adani listed companies fell 5% to 10%.

The move by Adani to repay share-backed borrowing early addressed one of the key concerns raised by Hindenburg: heavy borrowing using group shares as collateral. Adani said in a written statement that the pledge by major shareholders to repay that debt was “in continuation of promoter’s assurance to prepay all share-backed financing.”

The wild swings in share prices have highlighted concerns over corporate governance, especially as the country tries to woo foreign investors.

On Saturday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a rare statement seeking to calm investors.

“During the past week, unusual price movement in the stocks of a business conglomerate has been observed,” India’s market regulator said, without naming the Adani Group. It said mechanisms were in place to deal with volatility in specific stocks. The SEBI would examine any information before taking “appropriate action,” it said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday dismissed concerns the controversy would alarm global investors, saying India’s financial markets are “very well regulated”.

Hindenburg’s report said it was betting against the seven main publicly listed Adani companies, judging them to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.”

Adani built a fortune in trading and in coal mining and then branched into construction, power generation, operation of ports and airports, manufacturing defense equipment and running a media company.

Before the latest troubles, Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index listed Adani as Asia’s richest person and the world’s third wealthiest. Bloomberg’s rankings now put him at 21st wealthiest after his net worth sank to $59 billion from $120 billion.","The Adani group has denied any wrongdoing.

Legislators of India’s main opposition party have kicked off protests at some state-run companies over the crisis at Adani Group, whose seven listed firms saw another sell-off that drove their market loss to $112bn in less than two weeks.

Members of the Congress party on Monday protested outside several offices of state-owned insurer Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and the State Bank of India (SBI), both of which have exposure to Adani Group companies.

At one of the protest sites in Mumbai, people held up banners with the words “Save SBI”, television footage showed.

The crisis was triggered by United States-based short-seller Hindenburg Research’s January 24 report that accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation, unsustainable debt and use of tax havens.

The Adani Group, one of India’s top conglomerates, has rejected the criticism and denied wrongdoing in detailed rebuttals, but that has failed to arrest the unabated fall in its shares.

In the brutal fallout of the Hindenburg report, Adani Group flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd was forced to abandon a $2.5bn share sale last week, and Group chairman Gautam Adani lost his crown as Asia’s richest person and slipped down the global rankings of the wealthy.

Gautam Adani and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi are from the same state. Adani has denied allegations by Modi’s opponents that he had benefitted from their close ties, and Modi’s government has denied allegations of favouring Adani.

As Adani shares spiralled lower and cast a pall over Indian markets last week, opposition legislators disrupted parliament proceedings on Monday and demanded an inquiry.

Credit ratings warnings

The stock market rout triggered a series of credit ratings warnings on Friday with Moody’s saying the Group may struggle to raise capital, and S&P cutting its outlook on two Group companies.

Even attempts by regulators and the government to calm spooked investors do not appear to be working.

The Reserve Bank of India said on Friday the country’s banking system remains resilient and stable. The next day, India’s market regulator said the country’s financial markets remain stable and continue to function in a transparent and efficient manner.

SBI said on Friday it was not concerned about the exposure to the Adani Group, but further financing to its projects would be “evaluated on its own merit”.

India’s divestment secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told Reuters news agency on Friday that LIC shareholders and customers should not be concerned about its exposure to the Adani Group.

LIC has a 4.23 percent equity stake in the flagship Adani Enterprises, while its other exposures include a 9.14 percent stake in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Reuters said.

Shares of Adani Enterprises, which before the rout gained more than 1,000 percent in five years, sank 9.6 percent on Monday, taking its market capitalisation losses to nearly $28bn since the release of the report.

Adani Transmission Ltd dropped 10 percent, while Adani Green Energy Ltd, Adani Total Gas Ltd, Adani Power, and Adani Wilmar fell roughly 5 percent.

Goldman Sachs echoed the likes of Nomura and HSBC in saying that the latest developments are unlikely to result in a spillover effect for the wider Indian stock market.

Allegations of stock market manipulation and fraud have halved the net worth of Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, one of the wealthiest people in the world, in less than two weeks and wiped more than $110bn from his listed firms in India.

With investor confidence shaken, legislators have demanded an investigation into his businesses. Here’s a look at who Adani is, what concerns have been raised and what has happened since.

Who is Gautam Adani?

He is the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, one of the largest business conglomerates in India. A native of Gujarat — the same state where India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is from — Adani, 60, is a college dropout. He walked away from his father’s textile shop to set up a commodities trading business in 1988, his entry into the world of business.

Forbes magazine ranked Adani as the third-richest person in the world. But a recent stock rout has caused his fortune to slip, as he faces allegations of stock manipulation and debt concerns by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research.

What sectors does the Adani Group operate in?

The group has interests in ports, airports, gas distribution, green energy, data centres, agri logistics, edible oil, and power generation and transmission, among others. It reported revenues of $23bn in the most recent financial year, ending in March 2022.

The group is India’s biggest airport operator and also controls the Mundra Port in Adani’s home state, the country’s largest private port. Within this umbrella of businesses, seven firms are listed on the Indian stock exchanges. The Adani Group also owns a controversial coal mine in Australia, the Carmichael mine, which has been a lightning rod for climate change activists.

Over the years, the group has grown through acquisitions and collaborations. Most recently, in January, just days before the recent allegations, it led the consortium that bought Israel’s Haifa port. Last year, in June, French giant TotalEnergies SE and the Adani Group agreed to invest $5bn to produce green hydrogen and related products in India. In May, Adani became the second-largest cement producer in India after purchasing the Swiss firm Holcim’s India assets for $10.5bn.

Why is Adani’s rise controversial?

Adani’s rise has been meteoric and has benefitted from the support of Prime Minister Modi. Their ties date back to the days when Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat and Adani got land at cheap prices.

Claims of cronyism have followed Adani as he has picked up assets like ports, airport contracts and coal mines across the country, becoming one of the biggest and most powerful businessmen in the country in a very short span of time.

According to data from Forbes, Adani had a net worth of $2.8bn in 2014, just before the national elections that vaulted Modi into the role of prime minister. That wealth had catapulted to $126.4bn until the Hindenburg Research report on January 24 sent his business into crisis.

What is Hindenburg Research and what does its report say?

Hindenburg Research is a US-based forensic financial research firm that analyses the equity, credit and derivative offerings of companies. It looks for corporate wrongdoings and then places short-term bets against them.





The firm has alleged that the Adani Group has engaged in a “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades”.

Hindenburg Research based its assessment on a two-year investigation during which it says it reviewed thousands of documents, conducted site visits in almost half a dozen countries, and spoke with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of the Adani Group.

Here are some concerns the short seller has raised:

Key listed Adani companies have “substantial debt”, and some have pledged shares of their stock for loans. Five of seven key listed companies have reported “current ratios” below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.

The Adani Group uses a web of firms in tax havens to inflate revenue and stock prices and also provide cushioning to capital balances in order to make listed entities appear more creditworthy.

Offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest “public”, non-promoter holders of Adani stock.

The group had “virtually non-existent financial controls” and listed Adani businesses have seen sustained turnover in the role of the chief financial officer (CFO) — including its flagship company, Adani Enterprises, which has had five CFOs over eight years, a red flag for accounting issues.

The independent auditor for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas is a tiny firm called Shah Dhandaria, which has no current website, four partners and 11 employees. The Hindenburg report said it “hardly seems capable of complex audit work”. The audit partners at Shah Dhandharia, who respectively signed off on the annual audits for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas, were as young as 24 and 23 years old when they started. “They were essentially fresh out of school, hardly in a position to scrutinize and hold to account the financials of some of the largest companies in the country, run by one of its most powerful individuals,” the report said.

The report alleged that Adani family members cooperated to create offshore shell entities in tax-haven jurisdictions like Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates and several Caribbean islands, generating forged import/export documentation in an apparent effort to spur fake or illegitimate turnover and siphon money from the listed companies. It also cited previous fraud investigations by the Indian government, which have alleged money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds and corruption, totalling an estimated $17bn.

What has Adani said about the allegations?

The Adani Group said the report was issued with a “mala fide [bad faith] intention” to damage its reputation, days before the group was set to hold a public secondary share sale to raise $2.5bn, the largest such sale in the country. The Adani Group has alleged that the report’s “principal objective” was to derail the share offer.

What has happened since the report came out?

Adani’s secondary share sale was fully subscribed, but in a shocking reversal, the group called it off, marking a stunning setback for founder Gautam Adani and sending his stocks plunging further. About $112bn have been shaved collectively off the group’s various listed firms so far, taking Adani’s personal wealth down as well.

While calling off the secondary share sale, Adani said the group will review its capital market strategy once the markets stabilise.

It is not clear when that will happen as the group’s stocks continue to nosedive. The stock market rout triggered a series of credit rating warnings from the agency Moody’s, which says that the group may struggle to raise capital. The market index S&P has also cut its credit outlook for two Adani Group companies, raising fears of contagion for the rest of the stock market.

In the meantime, legislators from India’s main opposition parties have kicked off protests at some state-run companies with ties to the Adani Group firms and have demanded an investigation into the group.

What next?

The Indian markets regulator is examining the crash in shares as well as probing for any irregularities in the $2.5bn share sale, the Reuters news agency has reported.

To calm investors’ nerves, the Adani Group on Monday made a prepayment of $1.11bn towards loans ahead of their maturity in 2024, releasing shares that had been pledged by the family as collateral. But it is too soon to say how far that step will go in assuaging investor concerns.

While Adani’s net worth has tanked more than half to $61.7bn in less than two weeks, he is still one of the most powerful people in the world, with vast businesses in key sectors in India, employing more than 23,000 people. It is unlikely that he will go away anytime soon.","He is the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, one of the largest business conglomerates in India.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Hundreds of demonstrators from India’s main opposition party turned out Monday in India’s capital New Delhi and other cities demanding an investigation into allegations of fraud and stock price manipulation by India’s second-biggest business group, headed by coal mining tycoon Gautam Adani.

The Adani Group said Monday that its major investors, known in India as “promoters,” had pledged to prepay $1.1 billion in share-backed loans due for repayment by September 2024. The repayments include shares in Adani’s ports business, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission.

Shares in Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone jumped 9% after the announcement.

In New Delhi, Congress Party workers threw fake currency notes in the air and chanted slogans. Some burnt a suitcase plastered with images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adani. Some protesters scaled police barricades and were detained and taken away in police vans.

Opposition party workers in the financial capital, Mumbai, and in the southern city of Chennai gathered outside the offices of a state-run bank and the country’s largest insurer, which known to have investments in Adani shares.

So far, there is no sign the fracas was spreading across India’s financial sector and the protests are more a reflection of political theater rather than spontaneous public outrage. Lawmakers disrupted Parliament proceedings for a third day on Monday as calls mounted for India’s market regulator to look into Hindenburg’s claims.

Adani and his companies have lost tens of billions of dollars as investors dumped their shares. Last week, the Adani Group cancelled a $2.5 billion share offering, promising to provide refunds to investors.

The billionaire’s fortune had swelled by more than 2,000% in recent years. Critics say he has benefited from strong relationships with Modi and his government, while others point out he also prospered under previous administrations.

“What action has been taken, if ever, to investigate the serious allegations made over the years against the Adani Group?” Jairam Ramesh, the Congress Party’s general secretary, said in a statement issued over the weekend. “Is there any hope of a fair and impartial investigation under you?” he said in a reference to Modi.

Shares in Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship, wobbled Monday and were down 2.1% by mid-afternoon Monday. Its market value has shrunk by more than 50% since the Hindenburg report. Stock in five other Adani listed companies fell 5% to 10%.

The move by Adani to repay share-backed borrowing early addressed one of the key concerns raised by Hindenburg: heavy borrowing using group shares as collateral. Adani said in a written statement that the pledge by major shareholders to repay that debt was “in continuation of promoter’s assurance to prepay all share-backed financing.”

The wild swings in share prices have highlighted concerns over corporate governance, especially as the country tries to woo foreign investors.

On Saturday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a rare statement seeking to calm investors.

“During the past week, unusual price movement in the stocks of a business conglomerate has been observed,” India’s market regulator said, without naming the Adani Group. It said mechanisms were in place to deal with volatility in specific stocks. The SEBI would examine any information before taking “appropriate action,” it said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday dismissed concerns the controversy would alarm global investors, saying India’s financial markets are “very well regulated”.

Hindenburg’s report said it was betting against the seven main publicly listed Adani companies, judging them to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.”

Adani built a fortune in trading and in coal mining and then branched into construction, power generation, operation of ports and airports, manufacturing defense equipment and running a media company.

Before the latest troubles, Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index listed Adani as Asia’s richest person and the world’s third wealthiest. Bloomberg’s rankings now put him at 21st wealthiest after his net worth sank to $59 billion from $120 billion.","The Adani group has denied any wrongdoing.

Legislators of India’s main opposition party have kicked off protests at some state-run companies over the crisis at Adani Group, whose seven listed firms saw another sell-off that drove their market loss to $112bn in less than two weeks.

Members of the Congress party on Monday protested outside several offices of state-owned insurer Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and the State Bank of India (SBI), both of which have exposure to Adani Group companies.

At one of the protest sites in Mumbai, people held up banners with the words “Save SBI”, television footage showed.

The crisis was triggered by United States-based short-seller Hindenburg Research’s January 24 report that accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation, unsustainable debt and use of tax havens.

The Adani Group, one of India’s top conglomerates, has rejected the criticism and denied wrongdoing in detailed rebuttals, but that has failed to arrest the unabated fall in its shares.

In the brutal fallout of the Hindenburg report, Adani Group flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd was forced to abandon a $2.5bn share sale last week, and Group chairman Gautam Adani lost his crown as Asia’s richest person and slipped down the global rankings of the wealthy.

Gautam Adani and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi are from the same state. Adani has denied allegations by Modi’s opponents that he had benefitted from their close ties, and Modi’s government has denied allegations of favouring Adani.

As Adani shares spiralled lower and cast a pall over Indian markets last week, opposition legislators disrupted parliament proceedings on Monday and demanded an inquiry.

Credit ratings warnings

The stock market rout triggered a series of credit ratings warnings on Friday with Moody’s saying the Group may struggle to raise capital, and S&P cutting its outlook on two Group companies.

Even attempts by regulators and the government to calm spooked investors do not appear to be working.

The Reserve Bank of India said on Friday the country’s banking system remains resilient and stable. The next day, India’s market regulator said the country’s financial markets remain stable and continue to function in a transparent and efficient manner.

SBI said on Friday it was not concerned about the exposure to the Adani Group, but further financing to its projects would be “evaluated on its own merit”.

India’s divestment secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told Reuters news agency on Friday that LIC shareholders and customers should not be concerned about its exposure to the Adani Group.

LIC has a 4.23 percent equity stake in the flagship Adani Enterprises, while its other exposures include a 9.14 percent stake in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Reuters said.

Shares of Adani Enterprises, which before the rout gained more than 1,000 percent in five years, sank 9.6 percent on Monday, taking its market capitalisation losses to nearly $28bn since the release of the report.

Adani Transmission Ltd dropped 10 percent, while Adani Green Energy Ltd, Adani Total Gas Ltd, Adani Power, and Adani Wilmar fell roughly 5 percent.

Goldman Sachs echoed the likes of Nomura and HSBC in saying that the latest developments are unlikely to result in a spillover effect for the wider Indian stock market. ""We believe credit concerns are likely to be idiosyncratic in nature and are less likely to have broader contagion or systemic issues for the India offshore credit market,"" Goldman Sachs analysts Kenneth Ho and Chakki Ting said in a Friday note. They noted uncertainties surrounding Adani, saying its outstanding U.S. dollar bonds may hurt investor sentiment, but those concerns will be ""unlikely to have a broader contagion impact.""

Adani Group's total gross debt reached 2.2 trillion Indian rupees ($26.8 billion) as of end-March in 2022, according to the latest statement it's released in response to Hindenburg accusations of stock manipulation and fraud. ­­­The group is likely to scrap plans to raise roughly $500 million in overseas bond sales and will ""explore other financing options"" instead, India's Economic Times reported. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index showed founder and Chairman Gautam Adani's net worth fell further on Friday. His personal wealth has more than halved so far this year, down by 51.1%, or $61.6 billion.

'Resilient and stable'

Without mentioning Adani companies by name, the regulator noted ""unusual price movements in the stocks of a business conglomerate,"" adding that it is monitoring those moves. The regulator mentioned the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework – which compiles a list of companies about which the regulator advises investors to be ""extra cautious while dealing in these securities,"" according to the National Stock Exchange of India. Several Adani Group-affiliated companies are included on the ASM framework's long-term and short-term list, according to a notice on the NSE's website updated Monday.

Allegations of stock market manipulation and fraud have halved the net worth of Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, one of the wealthiest people in the world, in less than two weeks and wiped more than $110bn from his listed firms in India.

With investor confidence shaken, legislators have demanded an investigation into his businesses. Here’s a look at who Adani is, what concerns have been raised and what has happened since.

Who is Gautam Adani?

He is the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, one of the largest business conglomerates in India. A native of Gujarat — the same state where India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is from — Adani, 60, is a college dropout. He walked away from his father’s textile shop to set up a commodities trading business in 1988, his entry into the world of business.

Forbes magazine ranked Adani as the third-richest person in the world. But a recent stock rout has caused his fortune to slip, as he faces allegations of stock manipulation and debt concerns by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research.

What sectors does the Adani Group operate in?

The group has interests in ports, airports, gas distribution, green energy, data centres, agri logistics, edible oil, and power generation and transmission, among others. It reported revenues of $23bn in the most recent financial year, ending in March 2022.

The group is India’s biggest airport operator and also controls the Mundra Port in Adani’s home state, the country’s largest private port. Within this umbrella of businesses, seven firms are listed on the Indian stock exchanges. The Adani Group also owns a controversial coal mine in Australia, the Carmichael mine, which has been a lightning rod for climate change activists.

Over the years, the group has grown through acquisitions and collaborations. Most recently, in January, just days before the recent allegations, it led the consortium that bought Israel’s Haifa port. Last year, in June, French giant TotalEnergies SE and the Adani Group agreed to invest $5bn to produce green hydrogen and related products in India. In May, Adani became the second-largest cement producer in India after purchasing the Swiss firm Holcim’s India assets for $10.5bn.

Why is Adani’s rise controversial?

Adani’s rise has been meteoric and has benefitted from the support of Prime Minister Modi. Their ties date back to the days when Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat and Adani got land at cheap prices.

Claims of cronyism have followed Adani as he has picked up assets like ports, airport contracts and coal mines across the country, becoming one of the biggest and most powerful businessmen in the country in a very short span of time.

According to data from Forbes, Adani had a net worth of $2.8bn in 2014, just before the national elections that vaulted Modi into the role of prime minister. That wealth had catapulted to $126.4bn until the Hindenburg Research report on January 24 sent his business into crisis.

What is Hindenburg Research and what does its report say?

Hindenburg Research is a US-based forensic financial research firm that analyses the equity, credit and derivative offerings of companies. It looks for corporate wrongdoings and then places short-term bets against them.





The firm has alleged that the Adani Group has engaged in a “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades”.

Hindenburg Research based its assessment on a two-year investigation during which it says it reviewed thousands of documents, conducted site visits in almost half a dozen countries, and spoke with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of the Adani Group.

Here are some concerns the short seller has raised:

Key listed Adani companies have “substantial debt”, and some have pledged shares of their stock for loans. Five of seven key listed companies have reported “current ratios” below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.

The Adani Group uses a web of firms in tax havens to inflate revenue and stock prices and also provide cushioning to capital balances in order to make listed entities appear more creditworthy.

Offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest “public”, non-promoter holders of Adani stock.

The group had “virtually non-existent financial controls” and listed Adani businesses have seen sustained turnover in the role of the chief financial officer (CFO) — including its flagship company, Adani Enterprises, which has had five CFOs over eight years, a red flag for accounting issues.

The independent auditor for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas is a tiny firm called Shah Dhandaria, which has no current website, four partners and 11 employees. The Hindenburg report said it “hardly seems capable of complex audit work”. The audit partners at Shah Dhandharia, who respectively signed off on the annual audits for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas, were as young as 24 and 23 years old when they started. “They were essentially fresh out of school, hardly in a position to scrutinize and hold to account the financials of some of the largest companies in the country, run by one of its most powerful individuals,” the report said.

The report alleged that Adani family members cooperated to create offshore shell entities in tax-haven jurisdictions like Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates and several Caribbean islands, generating forged import/export documentation in an apparent effort to spur fake or illegitimate turnover and siphon money from the listed companies. It also cited previous fraud investigations by the Indian government, which have alleged money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds and corruption, totalling an estimated $17bn.

What has Adani said about the allegations?

The Adani Group said the report was issued with a “mala fide [bad faith] intention” to damage its reputation, days before the group was set to hold a public secondary share sale to raise $2.5bn, the largest such sale in the country. The Adani Group has alleged that the report’s “principal objective” was to derail the share offer.

What has happened since the report came out?

Adani’s secondary share sale was fully subscribed, but in a shocking reversal, the group called it off, marking a stunning setback for founder Gautam Adani and sending his stocks plunging further. About $112bn have been shaved collectively off the group’s various listed firms so far, taking Adani’s personal wealth down as well.

While calling off the secondary share sale, Adani said the group will review its capital market strategy once the markets stabilise.

It is not clear when that will happen as the group’s stocks continue to nosedive. The stock market rout triggered a series of credit rating warnings from the agency Moody’s, which says that the group may struggle to raise capital. The market index S&P has also cut its credit outlook for two Adani Group companies, raising fears of contagion for the rest of the stock market.

In the meantime, legislators from India’s main opposition parties have kicked off protests at some state-run companies with ties to the Adani Group firms and have demanded an investigation into the group.

What next?

The Indian markets regulator is examining the crash in shares as well as probing for any irregularities in the $2.5bn share sale, the Reuters news agency has reported.

To calm investors’ nerves, the Adani Group on Monday made a prepayment of $1.11bn towards loans ahead of their maturity in 2024, releasing shares that had been pledged by the family as collateral. But it is too soon to say how far that step will go in assuaging investor concerns.

While Adani’s net worth has tanked more than half to $61.7bn in less than two weeks, he is still one of the most powerful people in the world, with vast businesses in key sectors in India, employing more than 23,000 people. It is unlikely that he will go away anytime soon.","He is the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, one of the largest business conglomerates in India.
The Adani Group also owns a controversial coal mine in Australia, the Carmichael mine, which has been a lightning rod for climate change activists.
Last year, in June, French giant TotalEnergies SE and the Adani Group agreed to invest $5bn to produce green hydrogen and related products in India.

He called the nexus between politics and business a case study, and accused the government of bending rules and using agencies to give the Adani Group airport contracts.

""There should be a case study on Adani by business schools such as Harvard, on how the relationship between business and politics works, India is a case study,"" Gandhi said.

By Scott Murdoch

Feb 9 (Reuters) - Index provider MSCI said on Thursday it had determined that some Adani securities should no longer be designated as free float after market participants raised concerns about the eligibility of the Indian conglomerate's companies for some of its indexes.

Changes for Adani securities associated with its MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes are due to be announced on Thursday as part of its regular review for February, it added.

""MSCI has determined that the characteristics of certain investors have sufficient uncertainty that they should no longer be designated as free float pursuant to our methodology,"" it said in a statement.

The group led by billionaire Gautam Adani has been engulfed in crisis since U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report on Jan. 24 accusing the conglomerate of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation. It also raised concern about high levels of debt and what it said were excessive valuations.

The Adani Group has denied the allegations, saying the short seller's narrative of stock manipulation has ""no basis"" and stems from an ignorance of Indian law.

MSCI defines the free float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that is considered available for purchase in public equity markets by international investor.

Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

In response to the MSCI statement, Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson wrote on Twitter: ""We view this as validation of our findings"".

The report and its aftermath wiped out $110 billion off Adani's seven main listed stocks in slightly more than a week, and its flagship Adani Enterprises was forced to abandon a $2.5 billion stock offering.

Some of the companies' shares had been rebounding this week but they tumbled again on Thursday after the MSCI announcement. Adani Enterprises shares sank 10% in morning trading after recouping recent falls to multi-year lows.

Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas and Adani Power were each down 5%, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone were down nearly 9%. The short-selling attack and shelving of the share sale have tarnished Adani's reputation. India's Securities and Exchange Board of India regulator is investigating the market rout, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters this week.

Moody's rating firm has warned the share price declines could hit the group's ability to raise capital, while India's central bank is checking on lenders' exposure. JPMorgan said on Tuesday that Adani group companies remain eligible to be included in the bank's influential bond indexes.

Hindenburg has said it had taken short positions in Adani's U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivatives.

Adani companies said in filings on Tuesday the group was considering an independent evaluation of issues surrounding legal compliance, related party transactions and internal controls following the Hindenburg report.

However, headline peers traded with some caution, ahead of RBI's monetary policy outcome later in the day.

All eyes will be on RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das as the market experts are expecting a 25 basis points hike in the policy rates. For the bulls, less-hawkish Powell boosted the confidence of the traders.

At 9.20 am, the 30-share pack BSE Sensex was trading 220.75 points, or 0.37 per cent higher at 60,506.79. NSE's Nifty50 gained 76.20 points, or 0.43 per cent, at 17,797.70. Broader markets rose in tandem as BSE midcap and smallcap indices added one-third a per cent each. Fear gauge India VIX dropped over a per cent to 13.93-mark.

Both momentum indicators are advocating strength to persist from the lower levels; stochastic continues to trend higher and RSI still trading above its 9 EMA’s line while bouncing back from its oversold zone, said Yes Securities in its morning note.

'In the coming sessions, the trend is likely to be sideways or positive. We expect the index to hold key support of 17,650 followed by 17,550 levels where dips can be utilized for creating a long position. Fresh upside momentum is expected above 17,900-18,000 zones from where it can extend up to 18,200 levels,"" it said.

On a sectoral front, Nifty metal index rose 2 per cent, whereas IT index was up a per cent. Financial Services, PSU Bank and media index also posted decent gains. However, auto and realty indices led the losers, followed by pharma counters.

Among the Adani Group counters, Adani Enterprises hit an upper circuit of 10 per cent, whereas Adani Ports soared another 6 per cent. Adani Wilmar and Adani Transmission hit an upper circuit of 5 per cent each, whereas Adani Total Gas posted similar cuts. Adani Green Energy and Adani Power were also trading higher in the early trade.

Barring the Adani Group stocks, Ultratech Cement rose about 3 per cent amid the GST rate cut possibilities on the cement sector. Hindalco and SBI Life rose 2 per cent each. Bajaj Finance, Tata Consumer Products and Divis Labs were among the other top gainers.

Losers were led by Bharti Airtel, which dropped 2 per cent after a mixed bag in December 2022 quarter. Auto stocks including Eicher Motors, Hero Motocorp, Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors were also down a per cent each.

The important trends impacting markets globally are the developments in the US economy and rate action by the Fed. Fed chief Powell’s remarks yesterday were taken positively by the market. His comment that the 'disinflationary process will take a bit of time' is taken as confirmation of the disinflationary process underway, said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

""Also, the fact that the disinflationary process is happening even while the economy is creating a record number of jobs is regarded as positive. The unabated FII selling - Rs 7,774 crores in the last 3 sessions- is the biggest drag on the market now. In this context traders will also use rallies to sell,"" he said.

In the broader markets, Wonderla Holidays and CreditAccess Grameen surged 9 per cent each, whereas 63 Moons Technologies and Supriya Life Sciences gained 7 per cent each. Paytm jumped 7 per cent after strong Q3 numbers, whereas Zomato gained 7 per cent ahead of its earnings on Thursday.

This time, the PIL seeks the constitution of a committee under the head of a retired Supreme Court Judge to investigate the contents of the Research Report.



It was on January 24 that US-based Hindenburg published its report accusing Adani group of widespread manipulations and malpractices to inflate its stock prices. Adani Group refuted the allegations by publishing a 413-page reply and even went to the extent of terming it as attack against India. Hindenburg shot back with a rejoinder, saying that 'fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism and stood by its report.

Since the publishing of the Hindenburg report, Adani shares have been nosediving in the share market. The embattled group was also forced to recall its FPO, with the tumbling down of stock prices.

The petitioner, Vishal Tiwari, highlighted the drastic condition and fate of people when the shares 'fall' in the securities market due to various reasons.

""Lots of people who had the whole life time saving in such stocks gets a maximum setback due to fall in such shares with huge amount of money getting into drain. Various instances of suicides and other life taking incidences come up because of such huge loss of money where lifesaving of individuals is invested in.""

The PIL petition further drew a comparison between common citizens and big corporations in terms of getting a long sanctioned. This process is not easy for the citizens whereas, loans worth thousands and lacs of crores are disbursed to big business entities in a very short time.

The plea said that he publication of Hindenburg Report has led to the loss of a huge amount for various investors who have invested their life saving in such shares. In the aftermath of an 'unprecedented attack on billionaire Gautam Adani's vast empire by Hindenburg', the market value of all 10 Adani stocks have halved with investors sitting with a colossal loss of Rs 10 lakh Crore, the plea stated.

""In the last seven trading sessions since the release of the report by the American short-seller, the market capitalisation of all 10 Adani Group stocks is down by over 51% to Rs 9.31 lakh Crore. Adani Group stocks fell 5-20% on Friday, wiping out ₹3.19 trillion in investor wealth after Hindenburg Research said it stood by its findings of alleged share price manipulation and accounting fraud by the conglomerate"".

Interestingly, till date, the Respondents have taken no concrete step of action regarding the Adani-Hindenburg fiasco, despite there being a massive attack perpetrated on the economy system of the country.

It is the petitioner's case that State Bank of India which is India’s one of largest financial institutions, has provided loans amounting to $2.6 billion to companies in the Adani Conglomerate—there's no refinery process for loan disbursement, i.e., under what criteria and regulations this public money is spontaneously being used.

""The question that public interest now throws upon is how such public money is being floating in the money market without any refined process of loan being disbursed and such therefore has shaken the country through its huge exposure after the Hindenburg Report.""

Though, the Adani Enterprises rejected the report as “unresearched” and “maliciously mischievous”, the present PIL aimed to focus on the fate of such investors who've lost their money with no redressal available.

Stating that's it's a matter of ""serious concern"", the plea argued that such unregulated disbursal of loan with huge loss in the form of such huge exposure has destroyed public money at large with no redressal being addressed by the Respondents as to how to recover the losses in respect to public money.

""It is ultimately the public money for which the Respondents are answerable and there needs to be strict concern for mitigating of such loan with clear process and sanction policy for such high-stake loan amount.""

In this light, the plea also sought directions to setup a special committee for overseeing the sanction policy for High power loans crossing Rs. 500 crores which are given to big corporates.

Another PIL was filed a few days back by serial litigant Advocate ML Sharma, seeking to declare 'short-selling' as the offence of fraud. He seeks investigation against Nathan Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg, ""for exploiting innocent Investors via short selling under the garb of artificial crashing"".

BENGALURU, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Adani Total Private Ltd expects to receive 2.2 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at its terminal at Dhamra on India's eastern coast during the year ending March 2024, the company's chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday.

Adani Total has a 20-year take-or-pay contract to provide regasification services to state-run Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) for 3 million tonnes of LNG per annum at the Dhamra terminal. Government-run gas distributor GAIL (India) Ltd (GAIL.NS) has a similar 1.5 million tonnes per annum deal.

Adani Total - in which French oil and gas major TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) has a 50% stake - said it was still in discussions on how much gas it would supply Indian Oil and GAIL, adding that a final decision had not been taken yet.

""We are still in discussions, we have not finalized supply plans, but we are, in the first year, expecting close to about 2.2 million tonnes,"" Chief Executive Satinder Pal Singh told Reuters on the sidelines of the India Energy Week conference.

Indian Oil and GAIL did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on supply plans.

India's LNG imports fell for the second straight year in 2022, mainly due to fewer imports by utilities as the country ramped up coal-fired power production at the expense of natural gas.

The energy-hungry country expects deeper penetration of city gas distribution to drive LNG demand in the coming years.

The Dhamra terminal, which was supposed to be commissioned during the second half of 2021, is now expected to start operations in the fiscal year beginning April.

Under so-called ""take-or-pay"" obligations, payments are still due even if a buyer cancels a cargo due to unusually low demand.

""The demand is always there at the right price. I think things are starting to look better but it's a volatile market,"" Singh said.

Global LNG prices eased off record highs in the second half of 2022, amid ample inventories in North Asia and Europe.

Under the bid, worth Rs 5,400 crore, the Adani Group was supposed to supply around 7.5 million smart meters to the power distribution company.

In a notification dated February 4, the state discom said: “The tender has been cancelled due to unavoidable reasons.” The notification added that UP discoms, such as Madhyanchal, Dakshinanchal, Purvanchal, and Paschimanchal, had floated tenders for the supply of more than 25 million smart meters. The combined value of the whole project was Rs 25,000 crore.

MVVNL had invited the e-tender for the appointment of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) service provider for smart prepaid metering in MVVNL.

The Adani Group had submitted the lowest bid of Rs 10,000 per smart meter. But MVVNL officials termed it as very high, following which the discom cancelled the tender citing “unavoidable reasons”, the discom notification said. The MVVNL has now allowed all the companies to re-bid into the process.

Besides Adani Group, GMR, L&T, and Intellismart Infra had submitted their tenders for the project. It is interesting to note that none of these companies are manufacturers of smart meters. After winning the bid, the companies would probably engage smaller manufacturers to produce the smart meters.

Now, the discom is likely to opt for a fresh tendering process. There is a possibility that other UP discoms involved could tread a similar line after MVVNL’s step.

Meanwhile, the UP power consumers’ forum had already challenged the bids before the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC).

Under the standing billing guideline of the Rural Electrification Corporation, the price of the meters had been fixed at Rs 6,000 per unit.","Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (MVVNL), Uttar Pradesh's power utility, has cancelled its order to Adani Group to supply smart meters to the electricity distribution company (DISCOM).

She alleged that Gautam Adani, the chairman of Adani Group, had misused the system to acquire many businesses. The government, Moitra said, should launch a thorough probe as the country's reputation and financial stability were at risk.

Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Motira said an investigation by the market regulator Sebi was ongoing but Adani Group put out a statement saying it had been exonerated by the highest court of the land. ""Which court? Which nation?"" she asked. The parliamentarian further said that Gautam Adani, in his response to charges by Hindenburg, said his brother had no formal designation in the group so any transactions with his brother and entities controlled by him not be disclosed as related transactions.

""Why has Sebi been the silent operator? Why would they permit a Rs 20,000 crore FPO without (submitting) an investigation report? Why didn't Sebi ask whether bankers had signed off on the valuation? How's Mr A's son's father-in-law allowed to be on the Sebi committee on insider trading and corporate governance? How?"" Moitra asked while firing a barrage of questions at the government.

""What about the DRI, what about customs? What about GST? What are they doing? This is the deception of the highest order,"" the TMC MP asked. Adani, she alleged, has been permitted to use LIC, SBI, and the PSU banks to get money as and when he liked. She said LIC already had Rs 36,000 crore exposure to the group and the SBI had an outstanding loan of Rs 27,000 crore. ""Why were they again anchor investors in FPO?"" she asked.

Last month, Adani Group launched Rs 20,000 crore FPO (Follow-on Public Offer). For the first few days, the response was tepid due to the adverse report by Hindenburg and the subsequent stock plunge. However, the issue was subscribed fully by the closing day. The next day, markets crashed further, wiping off significant money of new investors in just a day. Rocked by the market volatility, the conglomerate called off the FPO saying it would not be morally correct to go ahead with it.

Today, Moitra alleged that the government tweaked rules to favour Adani. ""Odisha's Dhamra LNG Terminal was not awarded by tender. And even if it is awarded by tender, rules are tweaked to favor him (Gautam Adani). For example, when he won six airport tenders, the Airport Authority of India delayed the handover for three airports. He invoked force majeure (unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract), and they accepted it.""

The TMP MP further alleged that the GVK was forced to sell its stake to the Adani Group. She said GVK built the Mumbai airport, and they did a fantastic job. ""On July 2, 2021, the CBI filed a case against the GVK group. On July 18, the ED raided GVK in Mumbai and Hyderabad. Then they sold 50.05 per cent to A's company,"" she said.

Moitra said Adani managed to use his proximity in the shipping ministry to prevent dredging in Mumbai ports for years. ""So the traffic in JNPT (Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust) can't grow."" She also alleged that GAIL and IOC were manipulated into signing a Rs 46,500 crore 20-year pay or use contract for him in Dhamra that he got without tender.

Concluding her discussion, the parliamentarian said that India was on its way to becoming the third-largest economy in the world. The government, she said, should immediately order a thorough probe into all matters as the country's reputation, system, and stability of the markets were at risk. ""Don't worry about infrastructure assets.

BQ Prime,2023-03-02 14:33:12.783968,Adani Groups Infrastructure Businesses — Infravisioning With Vinayak Chatterjee,https://www.bqprime.com/opinion/adani-groups-infrastructure-businesses-infravisioning-with-vinayak-chatterjee,"Adani Group is one of the largest players in electricity generation, transmission and distribution across the full value chain. It is present in both...",None,Adani Group's Infrastructure Businesses — Infravisioning With Vinayak Chatterjee,"Vinayak Chatterjee: Bucket number one seeks to answer your question on the size and scale of Adani’s involvement and investment in Indian infrastructure projects.

Broadly, they are grouped in five investment groups. The first is energy and utility. The second is transport and logistics. The third is intermediate manufacturing. Fourth is natural resources and the fifth is not infra but it is FMCG, with one of their companies in the food business. So, here are the five buckets or the five groupings.

Let's look at energy and utility, which is group number one for the infra. Adani Group is one of the largest players in electricity generation, transmission and distribution across the full value chain. It is present in both conventional as well as renewable sectors, and it also has a vibrant investment programme for the manufacture of solar, wind and green hydrogen components. So, it has a significant presence in the energy and utility space.

The second group is transport and logistics. It is common knowledge that in the private sector, Adani Group is the largest owner operator of ports and airports. Increasingly, it is building a sizable portfolio in roads also, both as an investor and as an EPC contractor, and very few are aware of the fact that it is a significant player in warehousing. About 30% of India's grain storage is stored in Adani warehouses, whether in Punjab or at the ports. So, in transport and logistics, ports, airports, roads and warehouses, that's a very interesting and dominant cluster.

The third group is intermediate manufacturing. It is the second largest player in the cement business, with the acquisition of ACC Ltd. and Ambuja Cements Ltd. It also has projects in the intermediate space, which is green PVC, etc. So, after cement, it also has projects in the intermediate space.

Then, it has a group called natural resources. It is well-known that Gautam Adani’s entrepreneurial journey started in many sectors and in many senses in and, in fact, in coal mining and coal trading. Now, they have coal mines in Australia and Indonesia; there is a vibrant coal trading business. So, that's the natural resources, and with cement, you will have to be industrial resources with stuff like mining limestone, limestone quarries and all that.

All four form part of what would be called the natural resources mining space. Finally, in the non-infra space, there is a very interesting player in India’s FMCG market, which is the operation of this firm called Adani Wilmar Ltd., which manufactures and supplies this fairly famous brand of 'Fortune' oils. But it has gone far beyond oils to supply a lot of food staples into Indian households. ...Its turnover has overtaken that of Unilever India, which says quite a lot.

Therefore, having laid out this play of infrastructure, investments and projects, what is the common link? The common link is very simple. In practically every segment, it is the market leader.

It's interesting, it's not easy for a group to be a market leader in this wide span: in energy utility, transport logistics, intermediate, natural resources and FMCG, it is a market leader. In all, these businesses address very fast-growing domestic demand. If India is the fastest growing economy in the world, that gives energy to Fortune oil; it has an insatiable appetite to consume such outputs. It faces fast growing domestic demand. It has all these entities.

...I will see newspaper reports saying that the entire group is family dominated, but interestingly, all these businesses are headed by fairly reputed professional managers. It has all these businesses that have strong cash flows.

Advocate Vishal Tiwari, the PIL petitioner, mentioned the matter before Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha, and Justice JB Pardiwala today for urgent listing.

When asked by the Chief Justice what the matter was pertaining, Advocate Vishal Tiwari submitted–

""A similar petition is also coming tomorrow. This pertains to the Hindenburg report which has tarnished the image of the country and caused loss. This may be also heard tomorrow with the other matter.""

The PIL filed by Tiwari seeks the constitution of a committee under the head of a retired Supreme Court Judge to investigate the contents of the Hindeburg Research Report.

The CJI agreed to the request and directed for the PIL to be tagged with another one which is listed tomorrow (10th February 2023).

The other petition in question is filed by serial litigant Advocate ML Sharma and seeks to declare 'short-selling' as the offence of fraud. The said petition seeks investigation against Nathan Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg, ""for exploiting innocent Investors via short selling under the garb of artificial crashing"".

It was on January 24 that US-based Hindenburg published its report accusing Adani group of widespread manipulations and malpractices to inflate its stock prices. Adani Group refuted the allegations by publishing a 413-page reply and even went to the extent of terming it as attack against India. Hindeburg shot back with a rejoinder, saying that 'fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism' and stood by its report.

Since the publishing of the Hindeburg report, Adani shares have been nosediving in the sharemarket. The embattled group was also forced to recall its FPO, with the tumbling down of stock prices.

PM Modi took a swipe at protesting opposition members, saying their acts help BJP flourish further. He went on to say, “ I want to tell these MPs (Opposition MPs)...the more you throw 'keechad', the better the lotus will bloom.""

He added that ""the country carefully hears what is said in this House. Some MPs are bringing disrepute to this House.""

Prime Minister replied to allegations by Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and said ""Kharge Ji complains that I visit Kalaburagi. He should see the work done there.

So many people getting empowered, while someone's account getting closed, I can understand the pain.""

""Mallikarjun Kharge said that Congress built a strong foundation in 60 years. In 2014, when I saw minute details, I saw that in 60 years, the Congress family has only built potholes on the path.

The group will now shoot for revenue growth of 15% to 20% for at least the next financial year, down from the 40% growth originally targeted, said the people, who didn’t want to be named as the discussions are private. Capital expenditure plans will also be scaled down, they said, as the group prioritizes bolstering its financial health over aggressive expansion.

The shift shows how the ports-to-power conglomerate is focused on conserving cash, repaying debt and retrieving pledged shares as it scrambles to undo the damage from a scathing report by Hindenburg Research on Jan. 24. Even though Adani Group denied the allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation levied by the American short seller, the scandal triggered a stock rout that has wiped more about $120 billion off the Adani empire’s market value.

Holding back on investments for even as little as three months could save the conglomerate as much as $3 billion — funds that can be deployed to pay down debt or boost the cash pile, said another person.

The group’s plans are still being reviewed and are set to be finalized in the next few weeks, the people said.

An Adani Group representative didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comments on its plan to slash revenue target and delay capital expenditure.

‘Inter-Linkages’

“The scale and economic inter-linkages of the Adani businesses make it relevant to discuss what any pullback in the group’s investments could entail for the economy as a whole,” Barclays Plc’s analysts led by Avanti Save wrote in a Feb. 10 report. “A disruptive outcome of the situation or a sharp pullback in the group’s investments could have implications for India’s capex cycle.”

Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh told a local newspaper last month that the Adani group may dial back capital expenditure, as a follow-on share sale by Adani’s flagship firm was under way amid Hindenburg’s accusations.

If the follow-on offer failed to get subscribed, “we will postpone the growth program for six to nine months and then do it later,” Singh told The Hindu Businessline in an interview published Jan. 29. The sale was scrapped three days later, amid pressure from investors.

The retreat is a marked turnaround for a tycoon who was been on a rapid — and debt-fueled — expansion spree over the past few years, and reflects the significant impact Hindenburg’s assault has had on the conglomerate.

The first-generation entrepreneur, who started with an agri-trading firm in 1980s, rapidly built an empire that now spans ports, airports, coal mines, power plants and utilities. In the past couple of years, it forayed into green energy, cement, media, data centers and real estate, taking on considerable leverage in a way that has spooked some credit watchers.

Assuage Concerns

In the days following the Hindenburg-triggered stock meltdown, Adani and his companies have been working to assuage investor and lender concerns.

On Feb. 1, the flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. abruptly shelved the $2.5 billion follow-on share offer — despite it being fully subscribed the day before — as the tycoon sought to avert embarrassing mark-to-market losses for his investors amid the unrelenting stock selloff. A couple of days later, the company canceled a retail bond sale.

Adani Group has been focusing on staving off concerns about its financial health and shoring up sentiment.

On Feb. 6, the group said Adani and his family prepaid loans worth $1.11 billion to release pledged shares across three firms while the ports unit announced plans on Feb. 8 to repay 50 billion rupees debt in the year starting April to boost a key credit metric.

The conglomerate plans to prepay a $500 million bridge loan due next month after some banks balked at refinancing the debt, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday citing people familiar with the discussions. It was part of fundraising last year to finance the acquisition of Holcim Ltd.’s India cement assets.

Big Four Auditor

Adani Group plans to hire a Big Four auditor to “to carry out a general audit,” French energy giant TotalEnergies SE said in a statement earlier this month while describing its investments in India. This will help address some of the red flags raised by Hindenburg.

The Indian conglomerate has hired public relations firm Kekst CNC as its global communications adviser, Bloomberg News reported Saturday citing people familiar with the matter. Kekst, according to its website, has been involved in high-profile litigation matters, “working against some of the most aggressive counterparties.”

The attempts to calm investor nerves helped rally shares early last week but headwinds remain strong.

The stock selloff resumed after MSCI Inc. slashed the amount of shares it considers freely tradable for four of the companies — a move that will result in lower weightings in its indexes. Moody’s Investors Service on Friday cut its outlook for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and three other group companies citing the rout in shares.

Without naming Hindenburg Research, the ratings agency highlighted ""the recent release of a report from a short-seller highlighting governance concerns in the Group."" The U.S. short-seller in a Jan. 24 report accused the Indian conglomerate of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, and Adani has denied those allegations. Adani group companies have lost more than $100 billion in market capitalization as shares plunged since the Hindenburg report.

Credit concerns

For Adani Green Energy, Moody's said the downgrade to negative takes into consideration the company's large capital spending program and dependence on support from its sponsors. Moody's described Adani Green Energy's support will potentially come in the form of subordinated debt or shareholder loans, adding that it will ""likely be less certain in the current environment.""

""The negative outlook also factors in the company's significant refinancing needs of around $2.7 billion in fiscal year ending March 2025 and limited headroom in its credit metrics to manage any material increase in funding costs,"" it said.

MSCI on Thursday evening said it had cut its determined free float for four companies in the Adani Group: Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC. Free float measures for four other companies in the group remained the same.

The cuts, which will come into force at the end of February, will result in smaller weightings for those stocks in MSCI’s closely watched indices, triggering outflows as investors who track the benchmarks reduce their shareholdings.

On Wednesday, MSCI said “certain investors” in Adani Group “should no longer be designated as free float pursuant to our methodology” after receiving feedback from “a range of market participants”.

MSCI defines the free float of a company’s shares as the proportion available for purchase in public markets by international investors.

Indian tycoon Gautam Adani’s sprawling airports-to-energy empire has come under intense pressure and lost more than $100bn in market capitalisation after short seller Hindenburg Research accused his group of fraud and stock price manipulation.

The wipeout prompted a margin call from lenders, which include Barclays, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, on a $1.1bn share-backed loan, while France’s TotalEnergies paused a planned $4bn hydrogen project with the group.

Adani Group stocks are in several of MSCI’s equity benchmarks including the India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock indices.

Rival index provider FTSE Russell said last month that Adani index constituents included in its benchmarks “will continue to remain eligible in accordance with the underlying index methodologies”.

Shares in Adani Group’s listed companies sold off following Wednesday’s statement, with flagship business Adani Enterprises falling as much as 15 per cent after posting gains for two straight days.

An Asia equity strategist at one Wall Street investment bank said MSCI was likely to follow the precedent set by previous reviews of different companies and cut its free float estimates by about half.

“Potentially the weight of Adani stocks in the indices will be cut in half as a result, and passive investors will have to sell to reduce [the stocks’] weight accordingly in their portfolios,” the strategist said, adding that the bank estimated this would result in about $1bn-$1.5bn of outflows.

Those outflows will add to pressure on the company’s Mumbai-listed shares, which are components in MSCI’s India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock benchmarks.

The Adani Group did not respond to a request for comment.

Hindenburg’s report alleges that the Indian business empire uses funds domiciled offshore in Mauritius to conceal the true extent of the Adani family’s ownership of the group’s listed companies, as well as to skirt rules governing how much stock insiders can own.

Nathan Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg, said on Twitter following the MSCI announcement: “We view this as validation of our findings on offshore stock parking by Adani.”

The Adani Group, whose stocks account for more than 3 per cent of MSCI’s India index, has denied the claims.

Indian tax officials visited one of the warehouses of Adani Wilmar, the group’s joint venture with the Singapore food processing business, in the state of Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday evening.

“The officials did not find any irregularities in the operations and dealings conducted by the company,” said Adani Wilmar. “We would like to emphasise that this was a routine inspection carried out by the relevant authorities and there was no raid as previously stated or reported in the media.”","MSCI on Thursday evening said it had cut its determined free float for four companies in the Adani Group: Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC.
Free float measures for four other companies in the group remained the same.

The finance professor at the Stern school of business said fundamentals ""never come into play"" for Indian markets. ""Nobody wants to talk fundamentals, nobody wants to be bearish about a company and say that stock looks overpriced. It's not healthy for a market,"" Damodaran, told CNBC's ""Streets Sign Asia"" on Thursday. ""That's why I said Adani is not about the company … this is about the weakest links in the India story. And from my perspective, this is not a con game. This is just a company that's played those weaknesses."" Damodaran's remarks are an extension of his recent blog post, where he shared his views on the ongoing Adani affair.

On Jan. 24, U.S. based short-seller firm Hindenburg released a report accusing Indian billionaire Gautam Adani of pulling the ""largest con in corporate history,"" and alleged the conglomerate has engaged in stock manipulation and fraud. The Adani Group firmly denied the accusations, calling it a ""calculated attack on India"" and its institutions.

Valuation issues

Even though the Adani conglomerate spans ports, airports, mining, cement, power companies, Damodaran said he believed the Group's core business is in infrastructure. ""What I see is an infrastructure company ... if we just value the company as an infrastructure company, then the numbers just don't make sense from pricing perspective. How does the stock quadruple in market cap over a two or three year period?"" he pointed out. Even without the Hindenburg report, the professor noted he was ""hard pressed"" to explain why the company's share is so overpriced.

Adani Group's total gross debt reached 2.2 trillion Indian rupees ($26.8 billion) as of end-March 2022, according to calculations by Refinitiv Eikon. ""I am willing to believe that Adani Group has played fast and loose with exchange listing rules, that it has used intra-party transactions to make itself look more credit-worthy than it truly is,"" Damodaran said in the blog post. He added: ""Even if it has not manipulated its stock price directly, it has used the surge in its market capitalization to its advantage, especially when raising fresh capital.""

Damodaran also said the Adani affair provides an opportunity for Indian institutions to learn lessons and try to fix the problems. ""As for the institutions involved, which include banks, regulatory authorities and [Life Insurance Corporation], I have learned not to attribute to venality or corruption that which can be attributed to inertia and indifference,"" the economist said on his blog. ""A more nuanced version of the Adani story is that the family group has exploited the seams and weakest links in the India story, to its advantage,"" he said on the blog, adding that ""there are lessons for the nation as a whole, as it looks towards what it hopes will be its decade of growth.""

Exposure to Indian banks

The fallout from the Adani scandal has raised concerns about the Group's exposure to Indian banks. State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, told CNBC the loans they have extended to the Adani group are well covered and there should be no immediate risks.

CNN,2023-03-02 14:33:35.830421,Gautam Adani will be playing defense for a while after mauling by short seller,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/india-adani-hindenburg-report-impact-intl-hnk/index.html,"The sprawling Adani Group, which he founded over 30 years ago, has established interests in industries ranging from logistics to mining.",2023-02-10 00:00:00,Gautam Adani will be playing defense for a while after mauling by Hindenburg,"New Delhi (CNN) Gautam Adani may have to be a very different kind of businessman now.

The sprawling Adani Group, which he founded over 30 years ago, has established interests in industries ranging from logistics to mining. It hasn't stopped there. In the last few years, the tycoon has launched an astonishing expansion drive, moving into fields as diverse as media, data centers and airports, fueled by a borrowing binge.

But the trouncing his conglomerate has received in the three weeks since Hindenburg Research accused it of ""the largest con in corporate history"" may mark a big shift in his business strategy, analysts said.

""Until this report came out, if there was anything that was on sale in India, Adani would buy it,"" said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Piper Serica Advisors. ""The easy money they had access to is history now,"" he added, referring to the ease with which the group was able to raise capital for big acquisitions.

Adani's juggernaut, worth over $200 billion earlier this year, has borrowed $30 billion, making it one of the most indebted businesses in the country.

Adani Group has published a 400-page rebuttal of the claims made in a January 24 report by Hindenburg, an American short seller. But that didn't stop a brutal stock market meltdown that destroyed over 50% of the group's value, and wiped over $60 billion from Adani's personal fortune. The entrepreneur was Asia's richest man before the report came out and now occupies the 21st spot on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.

This week has remained turbulent for the group. While shares enjoyed a brief rebound mid-week, most of the 10 listed firms controlled by the conglomerate fell again in Mumbai on Friday.

The blows keep coming

The last two days have brought more bad news, including a major index provider, MSCI, reducing the weightings of some of the group's companies Thursday after it reviewed the proportion of shares not held by insiders. That means investors tracking an index will have to cut their holdings in those companies.

""We view this as validation of our findings on offshore stock parking by Adani,"" Hindenburg founder Nate Anderson said on Twitter . In its report, Hindenburg had alleged that ""offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest 'public' holders of Adani stock.""

An Adani Group spokesperson declined to comment.

On Friday, Moody's downgraded to negative from stable the outlook for the credit ratings of some Adani Group companies, including Adani Green Energy and two subsidiaries of Adani Transmission. It cited the ""significant and rapid decline"" in stock market values following the Hindenburg report.

Meanwhile, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said Thursday it had ""for all practical purposes...fully divested"" from the Adani companies. The world's biggest holder of equities had started shedding its stake long before the Hindenburg report was published.

One of Adani's biggest international partners , TotalEnergies, said Wednesday that it has put a green hydrogen deal with the group on hold

""It was announced, nothing was signed. It doesn't exist,"" said Patrick Pouyanne, the CEO of the French oil giant. ""Mr Adani has other things to deal with now.""

It's payback time

Those other things include repaying debt to calm investors and financiers. Moody's said last week that the plunge in the value of Adani companies was likely to reduce the group's ability to raise capital.

He needs to ""forget about aggressive acquisitions and focus on giving cash back to lenders,"" said Agarwal.

The besieged group has already taken some steps in that direction. On Monday, it said it will be paying back loans worth $1.11 billion ahead of their scheduled maturity in September 2024. The loans were backed by shares in Adani Ports, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission.

The next day, Adani Ports, India's largest private port operator, said ""the company is considering total loan repayment and prepayment"" of around $605 million, which would ""significantly"" improve its debt to earnings ratio.

Adani Ports operates Mundra Port, often called the group's ""crown jewel,"" and is located in the western Indian state of Gujarat. Its shares are up over 17% this week.

Despite these defensive moves, experts say that shares of Adani companies — including the flagship Adani Enterprises — will continue to see a much-needed correction in value.

weekend. ""I still think the company is priced too high, given its fundamentals and before factoring the damage that might have [been] done to the company's reputation and long term value, by this short selling episode,"" Aswath Damodaran, who teaches corporate finance and valuation at New York University, wrote in a blog post lastweekend.

Analysts have warned that questions about the health of Adani's empire are clouding the outlook for India Inc. Some of the biggest industrialists in the country have started sharing their views.

Anand Mahindra, chairman of the autos-to-technology conglomerate, said ""never, ever bet against India,"" in a tweet last week

Uday Kotak, India's richest banker according to Bloomberg's wealth index, said this week on Twitter that he does ""not see systemic risk to Indian financial system from recent events,"" but added that the country needs to strengthen ""underwriting and capacity building.""

""[L]arge Indian corporates rely more on global sources for debt and equity finance. This creates challenges and vulnerabilities,"" he said.

This view was reiterated in a report by Fitch Ratings this week.

""Even under a hypothetical scenario where the wider Adani Group enters distress, exposure for Indian banks should, in itself, be manageable."" it said . ""We currently believe the economic and sovereign implications of the Adani controversy remain limited.""

And CreditSights, a research firm owned by Fitch Group, said in a Tuesday report that the exposure of the State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, to the Adani Group was ""well-manageable.""","The sprawling Adani Group, which he founded over 30 years ago, has established interests in industries ranging from logistics to mining.

He added that ""the country carefully hears what is said in this House. Some MPs are bringing disrepute to this House.""

The group will now shoot for revenue growth of 15% to 20% for at least the next financial year, down from the 40% growth originally targeted, said the people, who didn’t want to be named as the discussions are private. Capital expenditure plans will also be scaled down, they said, as the group prioritizes bolstering its financial health over aggressive expansion.

The shift shows how the ports-to-power conglomerate is focused on conserving cash, repaying debt and retrieving pledged shares as it scrambles to undo the damage from a scathing report by Hindenburg Research on Jan. 24. Even though Adani Group denied the allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation levied by the American short seller, the scandal triggered a stock rout that has wiped more about $120 billion off the Adani empire’s market value.

Holding back on investments for even as little as three months could save the conglomerate as much as $3 billion — funds that can be deployed to pay down debt or boost the cash pile, said another person.

The group’s plans are still being reviewed and are set to be finalized in the next few weeks, the people said.

An Adani Group representative didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comments on its plan to slash revenue target and delay capital expenditure.

‘Inter-Linkages’

“The scale and economic inter-linkages of the Adani businesses make it relevant to discuss what any pullback in the group’s investments could entail for the economy as a whole,” Barclays Plc’s analysts led by Avanti Save wrote in a Feb. 10 report. “A disruptive outcome of the situation or a sharp pullback in the group’s investments could have implications for India’s capex cycle.”

Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh told a local newspaper last month that the Adani group may dial back capital expenditure, as a follow-on share sale by Adani’s flagship firm was under way amid Hindenburg’s accusations.

If the follow-on offer failed to get subscribed, “we will postpone the growth program for six to nine months and then do it later,” Singh told The Hindu Businessline in an interview published Jan. 29. The sale was scrapped three days later, amid pressure from investors.

The retreat is a marked turnaround for a tycoon who was been on a rapid — and debt-fueled — expansion spree over the past few years, and reflects the significant impact Hindenburg’s assault has had on the conglomerate.

The first-generation entrepreneur, who started with an agri-trading firm in 1980s, rapidly built an empire that now spans ports, airports, coal mines, power plants and utilities. In the past couple of years, it forayed into green energy, cement, media, data centers and real estate, taking on considerable leverage in a way that has spooked some credit watchers.

Assuage Concerns

In the days following the Hindenburg-triggered stock meltdown, Adani and his companies have been working to assuage investor and lender concerns.

On Feb. 1, the flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. abruptly shelved the $2.5 billion follow-on share offer — despite it being fully subscribed the day before — as the tycoon sought to avert embarrassing mark-to-market losses for his investors amid the unrelenting stock selloff. A couple of days later, the company canceled a retail bond sale.

Adani Group has been focusing on staving off concerns about its financial health and shoring up sentiment.

On Feb. 6, the group said Adani and his family prepaid loans worth $1.11 billion to release pledged shares across three firms while the ports unit announced plans on Feb. 8 to repay 50 billion rupees debt in the year starting April to boost a key credit metric.

The conglomerate plans to prepay a $500 million bridge loan due next month after some banks balked at refinancing the debt, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday citing people familiar with the discussions. It was part of fundraising last year to finance the acquisition of Holcim Ltd.’s India cement assets.

Big Four Auditor

Adani Group plans to hire a Big Four auditor to “to carry out a general audit,” French energy giant TotalEnergies SE said in a statement earlier this month while describing its investments in India. This will help address some of the red flags raised by Hindenburg.

The Indian conglomerate has hired public relations firm Kekst CNC as its global communications adviser, Bloomberg News reported Saturday citing people familiar with the matter. Kekst, according to its website, has been involved in high-profile litigation matters, “working against some of the most aggressive counterparties.”

The attempts to calm investor nerves helped rally shares early last week but headwinds remain strong.

The stock selloff resumed after MSCI Inc. slashed the amount of shares it considers freely tradable for four of the companies — a move that will result in lower weightings in its indexes. Moody’s Investors Service on Friday cut its outlook for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and three other group companies citing the rout in shares.

Without naming Hindenburg Research, the ratings agency highlighted ""the recent release of a report from a short-seller highlighting governance concerns in the Group."" The U.S. short-seller in a Jan. 24 report accused the Indian conglomerate of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, and Adani has denied those allegations.

Credit concerns

For Adani Green Energy, Moody's said the downgrade to negative takes into consideration the company's large capital spending program and dependence on support from its sponsors. Moody's described Adani Green Energy's support will potentially come in the form of subordinated debt or shareholder loans, adding that it will ""likely be less certain in the current environment.""

""The negative outlook also factors in the company's significant refinancing needs of around $2.7 billion in fiscal year ending March 2025 and limited headroom in its credit metrics to manage any material increase in funding costs,"" it said.

Rival index...",2023-02-09 05:30:16.091000+00:00,MSCI revises Adani Group weightings after free float review,"Global index provider MSCI has changed its weightings for some Adani Group stocks after reviewing how many shares could be freely traded, in a further setback for the Indian conglomerate reeling from fraud allegations.

MSCI on Thursday evening said it had cut its determined free float for four companies in the Adani Group: Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC. Free float measures for four other companies in the group remained the same.

The cuts, which will come into force at the end of February, will result in smaller weightings for those stocks in MSCI’s closely watched indices, triggering outflows as investors who track the benchmarks reduce their shareholdings.

On Wednesday, MSCI said “certain investors” in Adani Group “should no longer be designated as free float pursuant to our methodology” after receiving feedback from “a range of market participants”.

MSCI defines the free float of a company’s shares as the proportion available for purchase in public markets by international investors.

Indian tycoon Gautam Adani’s sprawling airports-to-energy empire has come under intense pressure and lost more than $100bn in market capitalisation after short seller Hindenburg Research accused his group of fraud and stock price manipulation.

The wipeout prompted a margin call from lenders, which include Barclays, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, on a $1.1bn share-backed loan, while France’s TotalEnergies paused a planned $4bn hydrogen project with the group.

Adani Group stocks are in several of MSCI’s equity benchmarks including the India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock indices.

Rival index provider FTSE Russell said last month that Adani index constituents included in its benchmarks “will continue to remain eligible in accordance with the underlying index methodologies”.

Shares in Adani Group’s listed companies sold off following Wednesday’s statement, with flagship business Adani Enterprises falling as much as 15 per cent after posting gains for two straight days.

An Asia equity strategist at one Wall Street investment bank said MSCI was likely to follow the precedent set by previous reviews of different companies and cut its free float estimates by about half.

“Potentially the weight of Adani stocks in the indices will be cut in half as a result, and passive investors will have to sell to reduce [the stocks’] weight accordingly in their portfolios,” the strategist said, adding that the bank estimated this would result in about $1bn-$1.5bn of outflows.

Those outflows will add to pressure on the company’s Mumbai-listed shares, which are components in MSCI’s India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock benchmarks.

The Adani Group did not respond to a request for comment.

Hindenburg’s report alleges that the Indian business empire uses funds domiciled offshore in Mauritius to conceal the true extent of the Adani family’s ownership of the group’s listed companies, as well as to skirt rules governing how much stock insiders can own.

Nathan Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg, said on Twitter following the MSCI announcement: “We view this as validation of our findings on offshore stock parking by Adani.”

The Adani Group, whose stocks account for more than 3 per cent of MSCI’s India index, has denied the claims.

Indian tax officials visited one of the warehouses of Adani Wilmar, the group’s joint venture with the Singapore food processing business, in the state of Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday evening.

“The officials did not find any irregularities in the operations and dealings conducted by the company,” said Adani Wilmar. “We would like to emphasise that this was a routine inspection carried out by the relevant authorities and there was no raid as previously stated or reported in the media.”","MSCI on Thursday evening said it had cut its determined free float for four companies in the Adani Group: Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC.

The finance professor at the Stern school of business said fundamentals ""never come into play"" for Indian markets. ""Nobody wants to talk fundamentals, nobody wants to be bearish about a company and say that stock looks overpriced. It's not healthy for a market,"" Damodaran, told CNBC's ""Streets Sign Asia"" on Thursday. ""That's why I said Adani is not about the company … this is about the weakest links in the India story. And from my perspective, this is not a con game. This is just a company that's played those weaknesses."" Damodaran's remarks are an extension of his recent blog post, where he shared his views on the ongoing Adani affair.

On Jan. 24, U.S. based short-seller firm Hindenburg released a report accusing Indian billionaire Gautam Adani of pulling the ""largest con in corporate history,"" and alleged the conglomerate has engaged in stock manipulation and fraud. The Adani Group firmly denied the accusations, calling it a ""calculated attack on India"" and its institutions.

Valuation issues

Even though the Adani conglomerate spans ports, airports, mining, cement, power companies, Damodaran said he believed the Group's core business is in infrastructure. ""What I see is an infrastructure company ... if we just value the company as an infrastructure company, then the numbers just don't make sense from pricing perspective. How does the stock quadruple in market cap over a two or three year period?"" he pointed out. Even without the Hindenburg report, the professor noted he was ""hard pressed"" to explain why the company's share is so overpriced.

Adani Group's total gross debt reached 2.2 trillion Indian rupees ($26.8 billion) as of end-March 2022, according to calculations by Refinitiv Eikon. ""I am willing to believe that Adani Group has played fast and loose with exchange listing rules, that it has used intra-party transactions to make itself look more credit-worthy than it truly is,"" Damodaran said in the blog post. He added: ""Even if it has not manipulated its stock price directly, it has used the surge in its market capitalization to its advantage, especially when raising fresh capital.""

Damodaran also said the Adani affair provides an opportunity for Indian institutions to learn lessons and try to fix the problems. ""As for the institutions involved, which include banks, regulatory authorities and [Life Insurance Corporation], I have learned not to attribute to venality or corruption that which can be attributed to inertia and indifference,"" the economist said on his blog. ""A more nuanced version of the Adani story is that the family group has exploited the seams and weakest links in the India story, to its advantage,"" he said on the blog, adding that ""there are lessons for the nation as a whole, as it looks towards what it hopes will be its decade of growth.""

Exposure to Indian banks

The fallout from the Adani scandal has raised concerns about the Group's exposure to Indian banks. State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, told CNBC the loans they have extended to the Adani group are well covered and there should be no immediate risks.

The sprawling Adani Group, which he founded over 30 years ago, has established interests in industries ranging from logistics to mining. It hasn't stopped there. In the last few years, the tycoon has launched an astonishing expansion drive, moving into fields as diverse as media, data centers and airports, fueled by a borrowing binge.

But the trouncing his conglomerate has received in the three weeks since Hindenburg Research accused it of ""the largest con in corporate history"" may mark a big shift in his business strategy, analysts said.

""Until this report came out, if there was anything that was on sale in India, Adani would buy it,"" said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Piper Serica Advisors. ""The easy money they had access to is history now,"" he added, referring to the ease with which the group was able to raise capital for big acquisitions.

Adani's juggernaut, worth over $200 billion earlier this year, has borrowed $30 billion, making it one of the most indebted businesses in the country.

Adani Group has published a 400-page rebuttal of the claims made in a January 24 report by Hindenburg, an American short seller. But that didn't stop a brutal stock market meltdown that destroyed over 50% of the group's value, and wiped over $60 billion from Adani's personal fortune. The entrepreneur was Asia's richest man before the report came out and now occupies the 21st spot on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.

This week has remained turbulent for the group. While shares enjoyed a brief rebound mid-week, most of the 10 listed firms controlled by the conglomerate fell again in Mumbai on Friday.

The blows keep coming

The last two days have brought more bad news, including a major index provider, MSCI, reducing the weightings of some of the group's companies Thursday after it reviewed the proportion of shares not held by insiders. That means investors tracking an index will have to cut their holdings in those companies.

""We view this as validation of our findings on offshore stock parking by Adani,"" Hindenburg founder Nate Anderson said on Twitter . In its report, Hindenburg had alleged that ""offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest 'public' holders of Adani stock.""

An Adani Group spokesperson declined to comment.

On Friday, Moody's downgraded to negative from stable the outlook for the credit ratings of some Adani Group companies, including Adani Green Energy and two subsidiaries of Adani Transmission. It cited the ""significant and rapid decline"" in stock market values following the Hindenburg report.

Meanwhile, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said Thursday it had ""for all practical purposes...fully divested"" from the Adani companies. The world's biggest holder of equities had started shedding its stake long before the Hindenburg report was published.

One of Adani's biggest international partners , TotalEnergies, said Wednesday that it has put a green hydrogen deal with the group on hold

""It was announced, nothing was signed. It doesn't exist,"" said Patrick Pouyanne, the CEO of the French oil giant. ""Mr Adani has other things to deal with now.""

It's payback time

Those other things include repaying debt to calm investors and financiers. Moody's said last week that the plunge in the value of Adani companies was likely to reduce the group's ability to raise capital.

He needs to ""forget about aggressive acquisitions and focus on giving cash back to lenders,"" said Agarwal.

The besieged group has already taken some steps in that direction. On Monday, it said it will be paying back loans worth $1.11 billion ahead of their scheduled maturity in September 2024. The loans were backed by shares in Adani Ports, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission.

The next day, Adani Ports, India's largest private port operator, said ""the company is considering total loan repayment and prepayment"" of around $605 million, which would ""significantly"" improve its debt to earnings ratio.

Adani Ports operates Mundra Port, often called the group's ""crown jewel,"" and is located in the western Indian state of Gujarat. Its shares are up over 17% this week.

Despite these defensive moves, experts say that shares of Adani companies — including the flagship Adani Enterprises — will continue to see a much-needed correction in value.

weekend. ""I still think the company is priced too high, given its fundamentals and before factoring the damage that might have [been] done to the company's reputation and long term value, by this short selling episode,"" Aswath Damodaran, who teaches corporate finance and valuation at New York University, wrote in a blog post lastweekend.

Analysts have warned that questions about the health of Adani's empire are clouding the outlook for India Inc. Some of the biggest industrialists in the country have started sharing their views.

Anand Mahindra, chairman of the autos-to-technology conglomerate, said ""never, ever bet against India,"" in a tweet last week

Uday Kotak, India's richest banker according to Bloomberg's wealth index, said this week on Twitter that he does ""not see systemic risk to Indian financial system from recent events,"" but added that the country needs to strengthen ""underwriting and capacity building.""

""[L]arge Indian corporates rely more on global sources for debt and equity finance. This creates challenges and vulnerabilities,"" he said.

This view was reiterated in a report by Fitch Ratings this week.

""Even under a hypothetical scenario where the wider Adani Group enters distress, exposure for Indian banks should, in itself, be manageable."" it said . ""We currently believe the economic and sovereign implications of the Adani controversy remain limited.""

And CreditSights, a research firm owned by Fitch Group, said in a Tuesday report that the exposure of the State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, to the Adani Group was ""well-manageable.""","The sprawling Adani Group, which he founded over 30 years ago, has established interests in industries ranging from logistics to mining.

By India Today Web Desk: Days after its promoters paid off a $1.11 billion dollar loan before schedule, the Adani Group plans to prepay another $500 million loan due next month to regain the confidence of some banks, following a scathing report by US short seller Hindenburg Research.

The Gautam Adani-led conglomerate is planning the prepayment after some banks balked at refinancing debt, reported Bloomberg. Barclays Plc, Standard Chartered Plc and Deutsche Bank AG are among the banks that have lent $4.5 billion to finance the purchase of Holcim Ltd.'s cement assets last year. A portion of that loan is due for payment on March 9.

The lenders were in talks to refinance the loan up to a week before the critical report was published by Hindenburg Group, said the Bloomberg report, quoting people familiar with the matter.

However, those negotiations stalled after the Hindenburg report, which accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, among others. The report also raised concerns over mounting debt at Adani Group companies.

Foreign banks grow hesitant

The reluctance to refinance debt is the first sign that global banks are becoming wary of lending to Gautam Adani’s companies, and also coincides with France’s Total Energy’s comments that a multi-billion dollar plan to produce green hydrogen with the Indian tycoon has been put on hold, pending audits of his conglomerate.

Meanwhile, index provider Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) said that it is reviewing the free float status of some Adani Group securities after market participants raised concerns about the eligibility of the Indian conglomerate's companies for some of its indexes. Moreover, major asset managers in Japan are stepping up disclosure of funds with exposure to Adani, indicating that foreign investors are also turning cautious.

An Adani spokesperson said the conglomerate had been in talks with banks to refinance that part of the loan but has decided to prepay it. The spokesperson said discussions with the banks have not stalled. On the other hand, none of the lenders have shared any comments on the developments.

Earlier, the group’s promoters paid $1.11 billion in loans borrowed against pledged shares – a move largely aimed at boosting investor confidence in the wake of the massive stock rout that wiped off over $100 billion from the group’s total market value.

While Adani Group stocks regained some momentum this week, shares of the conglomerate’s listed companies tumbled again on Thursday amid fresh concerns over lending hesitancy and scrutiny.

Plastered on the side of the aircraft was the name of an industrial tycoon and a personal friend of the new premier: Adani.



The son of a small textile merchant, Gautam Adani is a key ally of Modi and his Right-wing Bharatiya Janata party.

His rise mirrored that of the prime minister’s. Both men hail from the western state of Gujarat, where they built their respective business and political power bases before propelling on to the national stage.

Since Modi took office nine years ago, Adani’s fortune has ballooned as his sprawling empire won state contracts to build infrastructure projects across the country, making him one of the world’s richest men with a net worth of $134bn (£110bn) at the end of last year.



But now, the Adani Group is in crisis after a US-short seller accused it of stock price manipulation and accounting fraud late last month.



While Adani has strongly denied the allegations and issued a 400-page rebuttal, the claims raise questions about the meteoric rise of one of India’s standout success stories and poses a major test for Indian capitalism and its reputation among international investors.

The Adani Group is an Indian industrial conglomerate that spans ports, airports, power, coal and renewable energy infrastructure.



The company was founded by its eponymous chairman in the late 1980s as a commodity trading business and quickly expanded into port infrastructure to boost its trading operations.

In recent years, the company has grown into an empire of strategic importance that affects the lives of millions of Indians on a daily basis. Among other things, Adani stores a third of the country’s grain, produces a fifth of its cement and is one of India’s biggest private airport operators.","After sweeping to victory in the 2014 general election, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi hopped on a private jet from his home state of Gujarat to the capital New Delhi.

The wealth fund sold its stakes in three companies of Adani group, ie Adani Total Gas, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zones and Adani Green Energy.

The $1.35 trillion sovereign wealth fund made it clear that in recent weeks it divested virtually all its remaining shares in companies belonging to Adani group.

The fund had sold its stakes from five Adani companies since 2014 and by the end of 2022, they owned shares in three of its companies.

""We have monitored Adani for many years (on ESG) issues, many on their handling of environmental risks,"" Christopher Wright, the fund's head of ESG risk monitoring, told a news conference.

""Since year-end, we have further reduced in Adani companies. We have no exposure left,"" he added.

At the end of 2022, the Norwegian fund owned Adani Green Energy's sharaes worth $52.7 million, a stake in Adani Total Gas worth $83.6 million. It also enjoyed ownership in Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone worth $63.4 million.

The Norweigan fund is managed by a unit of the central bank. It owns 1.3% of all globally listed shares and has stakes in more than 9,000 companies.

Notably, Adani Group lost its $110 billion of wealth on Indian stocks after the US based short seller Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate in its report of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation. The Adani Group's seven main companies are listed in the Indian-listed stocks.

The allegations made by the report on the business tycoon has also become a hot potato in the current political scenario of the country. However, the Adani Group has denied any wrongdoing.

The company, part of a larger conglomerate led by billionaire Gautam Adani, has been hit by a market rout after US short-seller Hindenburg Research on Jan. 24 alleged it had engaged in stock manipulation and used tax havens.

The group has denied all allegations. Adani Group first said it would evaluate an independent review while reporting results for other group companies on Tuesday.

The company, which distributes piped gas in various Indian cities, said consolidated profit rose to 1.5 billion rupees ($18.18 million) in the quarter-ending Dec. 31, from 1.28 billion rupees a year ago.

Global gas prices have jumped due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Adani Total Gas said it sourced gas through bilateral trades and Indian Gas Exchange, helping the company better manage volatility in prices, it said. Short-term contracts helped in improving gas cost, it said.

Revenue from operations rose 27.3% to 11.86 billion rupees at the company, a joint venture between France's energy major Total and Adani Group.

Adani Total stocks have been the worst affected ones, losing over $34 billion in market value since the short seller's report came in.

TotalEnergies has not yet signed a contract announced last year with Adani, waiting for the result of an audit launched by the Indian conglomerate, the chief executive of the French oil major said on Wednesday

Traders across the globe are awaiting US inflation data, which is due next week. It is likely to provide some cues over Fed's monetary policy move.

On the domestic front, intense FII selling remains a concern for Indian equities. However, increased inflows from domestic investors are supporting the market sentiments. Analysts believe that Q3 earnings would guide the markets in the near term.

At 9.20 am, BSE Sensex was trading 178.01 points, or 0.29 per cent, lower at 60,,629.21, whereas NSE's Nifty50 index was down 60.25 points, or 0.34 per cent, at 17,833.20. Broader markets were trading with mixed cues as the BSE midcap index was in red, whereas BSE smallcap index rose marginally. Fear gauge India VIX eased further to slip below 13-mark.

All the major sectors were trading in red at the opening tick. The Nifty metal index plunged over a per cent, whereas the IT index also posted similar cuts. Pharma and Realty indexes were down a per cent, each. However, auto, PSU bank and media stocks were marginally up.

Among the Adani Group stocks, Adani Enterprises turned flat after a 10 per cent cut at open. Adani Ports was trading marginally up, whereas NDTV, ACC and Ambuja Cements declined. Adani Power, Adani Transmission, Adani Green, Adani Wilmar and Adani Total Gas fell 5 per cent, each.

In the Nifty50 pack, HCL Technologies dropped more than 2 per cent, whereas Hindalco, Wipro, Tata Steel and Infosys shed over a per cent, each. On the other hand, UPL gained over a per cent among the blue-chip counters. Larsen & Toubro, HDFC Life Insurance and ITC were other key gainers.

With the Budget, monetary policy and earnings season behind us, there are no major triggers to take the market forward. Rallies are likely to be sold since FIIs have been sustained sellers in the market since the beginning of 2023. But, FII selling has declined to Rs 144 crore is a positive, said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

""Rising inflows when the market is weak is a very healthy trend and can act as a counter to the rising FII outflows. This will bring stability to the market,"" he said. ""Q3 results from the broader market indicate pressure on margins. Many mid and smallcap results are disappointing. Now, safety is in large caps. Investors should focus on segments.""

In the broader markets, One97 Communications (Paytm) dropped 7 per cent over the bulk deal buzz and addition to ASM stage 1. Sportking India weakened 6 per cent. Lupin and United Breweries plunged 5 per cent as both companies reported poor performance in the December 2022 quarter.

Among the gainers, WPIL extended its gains and hit an upper circuit of 20 per cent strong quarterly earnings. Aarti Surfactants was up 12 per cent, whereas BF Investments gained 9 per cent. Techno Electric & Engineering Company and Spandana Sphoorty Financial gained 7 per cent, each.

Adani Group has come under fire after accusations of endemic fraud and stock manipulation made by Hindenburg Research, a New York-based group focused on finding corporate wrongdoings and making bets against companies. Adani Group denies the allegations.

Total has stakes in ventures with Adani worth over $3bn, making it one the largest foreign investors in businesses with the Indian group. The firm’s comments came the same day as Total joined the oil sector’s blockbuster profits, posting a record high net profit of $36.2bn in 2022 — double that of the previous year’s.

Adani has committed $50bn of investment to green hydrogen projects over the next decade, despite uncertainty over future demand, infrastructure and viability of large-scale clean hydrogen production.

Taiwan and Canada talk trade

Formal negotiations on bilateral trade and investment will begin between Taiwan and Canada, despite Chinese opposition to Taipei’s courting of Western governments.

In a virtual meeting on February 7, Canada’s Minister for International Trade, Mary Ng, agreed with Taiwanese trade negotiator Deng Zhenzhong, to begin formal talks on investment promotion, protection and liberalisation. This comes six months after initial discussions began in June 2022.

Ms Ng highlighted Taiwan’s key position as a trade partner, particularly in agriculture and advanced manufacturing, a government statement said, as Canada “deepens” economic partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has denounced other Western countries’ diplomatic engagement with Taiwan. This includes Lithuania, which came under Chinese pressure in 2022 after allowing Taiwan to open an embassy in its capital Vilnius.

Taiwan, which rejects China’s sovereignty claims, has become a focal point of US–China tensions due in part to local contract chipmaker TSMC and its role as a major hub for semiconductor manufacturing.

Unilever plans $400m Mexico investment

Consumer goods giant Unilever will build a new regional manufacturing plant in northern Mexico, as part of a $400m investment in the country over the next three years.

The plant will manufacture beauty and personal care products in the northern Mexican border state of Nuevo León, the company said on February 7, with operations expected to start in 2024. The investment will create 1200 new direct and indirect jobs in the country.

Unilever’s investment comes as “nearshore” locations such as Mexico benefit from multinationals regionalising their supply chains by building up production capacity close to the final markets of their products.

The Inter-American Development estimates that nearshoring could generate an extra $78bn in exports of goods and services from Latin America and the Caribbean in the near-to-medium term. Unilever says Mexico is “among the 10 most relevant countries” for its global operations, with four plants already in operations in the country.","France’s TotalEnergies has halted a planned $4bn green hydrogen investment with the beleaguered Indian conglomerate Adani Group, the energy titan told reporters at the Financial Times.

In March 2022, the company said the proposed amalgamation envisaged under this scheme is intended to achieve size, scalability, integration, improved controls, cost and resource use optimisation, greater financial strength and flexibility, thereby building a more resilient and robust organisation that address dynamic business situations and volatility in various economic factors in a focused manner, to achieve improved long-term financial returns.

There will be no change in the equity shareholding pattern of the company under the scheme, as no shares are being issued by the firm in connection with the scheme, it added.

Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after US-based activist short-seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share price manipulation, against the Gautam Adani-led group.

The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements. It termed the Hindenburg report baseless and threatened to sue the short seller.","Shares of Adani Power Ltd ended at Rs 172.90, down by Rs 9.10, or 5.00 percent on the BSE.

Adani fallout: Market regulator has a challenge in its hands,"The problem of money belonging to Indian entities being ‘round-tripped’ through shell companies in offshore tax havens is not a new one. Despite regulatory tightening over the years, loopholes are exploited to conceal the beneficial owners of the shell companies.

The Hindenburg research report on the Adani group has once again called attention to this issue, pointing out that the latter had 38 shell companies in Mauritius besides other such brass-plate entities in Cyprus, the UAE, Singapore and Caribbean islands through which money was being round-tripped into listed as well as unlisted companies in the group.

It is just as well that the stock market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), is beginning to act on this important issue. A report in this newspaper said that the regulator has asked designated depository participants to update details pertaining to the beneficial owners of all foreign portfolio investors onboarded by them, by September 30. FPIs which do not comply could have their registrations cancelled.

The problem is that many of these FPIs are structured as multi-layered entities where it is easy to conceal the ultimate owner of the company. In 2018, SEBI tried to tighten norms by laying down that a ‘natural person’ should be the ultimate owner of FPI. The owner’s details such as address, ID and passport had to be collected and held by the custodians and given to regulatory authorities during investigations.

Identification of beneficial owners was based on Rule 9 of the Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005, wherein companies owning more than 25 per cent of the FPI or individuals, partnership firms, trusts and unincorporated association of persons owning 15 per cent of the FPI were identified as beneficial owner. In case a BO could not be identified through ownership or control, the investment manager had to be identified as the BO and his details provided to the depository.

But the Adani episode seems to suggest that it is still possible to evade identification by maintaining ownership and control beneath the threshold limit or by using other entities as facades to evade identification.

SEBI needs to apply the ‘look through’ principle in such cases, where following the letter of law may not prove adequate. Stringent penalties should be imposed on market intermediaries abetting such fund flows; they should be banned from markets altogether. SEBI should also reduce the time given to FPIs to disclose the BO to three months.

Also of concern is the new report that a bear cartel based overseas, took short position in Adani stocks in the domestic market through the use of structured product derivatives (SPDs), which are issued to these investors by FPIs registered with SEBI.

If overseas traders are able to create a rout amounting to $100 billion in Adani shares, without a presence in India, this poses a systemic risk. SEBI will have to take a closer look at SPDs — rules governing their issuance, entities to whom they can be issued, stock and market level thresholds, etc.","The problem of money belonging to Indian entities being ‘round-tripped’ through shell companies in offshore tax havens is not a new one.

New Delhi: Congress MP...,None,Congress poses series of questions to govt on Adani issue,"The Congress asked the government on Saturday if it is prudent from a national security perspective for a firm facing serious accusations of money laundering to be allowed to dominate a strategic sector like ports. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, in his series of ""Hum Adanike Hain Kaun"" questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said these queries relate to industrialist Gautam Adani 's rapidly expanding monopoly in the ports sector.""Even though it is a Saturday here is HAHK (Hum Adanike Hain Kaun)-7. 'Chuppi Todiye Pradhan Mantriji',"" Ramesh wrote on Twitter.He said the Adani Group controls 13 ports and terminals that represent 30 per cent of India's ports capacity and 40 per cent of the total container volume. ""It is no surprise that this growth trajectory has accelerated since 2014,"" the former Union minister added.He said in addition to the Mundra port in Gujarat, recent acquisitions of the business group include the Dhamra port in Odisha (2015), the Kattupalli port in Tamil Nadu (2018), the Krishnapatnam (2020) and Gangavaram (2021) ports in Andhra Pradesh and the Dighi port in Maharashtra (2021).""There is a clear strategy at work: Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha account for 93 per cent of the overseas cargo traffic from India's 'non-major ports'.

Have the concession agreements been changed to accommodate Adani 's commercial interests?"" he asked.The Congress has been posing questions to the government on the Adani issue ever since a report of US-based short-selling firm Hindenburg Research levelled allegations of financial irregularities against the business group, leading to a meltdown of its stocks on exchanges.The opposition party has also been demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into the issue.","Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, in his series of ""Hum Adanike Hain Kaun"" questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said these queries relate to industrialist Gautam Adani 's rapidly expanding monopoly in the ports sector.

To take the discussion further, founder and CMD, First Global, Devina Mehra said if we vary the assumptions that Damodaran took to arrive at the valuation, the fair value drops further.

She points at the fact that she doesn't use DCF calculations regularly anymore as one can justify any value one wants to. With change in assumptions for the calculation, the result could be very different, and not always accurate.

She said if cost of capital in Damodaran's assumptions is increased from 10% to 12%, the value further drops to ₹645.

The ace investor shared her views on Adani Enterprises share price from her official twitter handle citing, ""We all know by now Prof @AswathDamodaran 'fair value' calculation of Rs.948 per share for Adani Enterprises. Here's what happens if you vary the assumptions. If Cost of capital increases from 10% to 12% (logical as Risk free yields are 7.3% in India), the value drops to 645.""

""Prof. Damodaran himself mentions an equity risk premium over risk-free rate of 4.5%. So 12% appears logical even without accounting for the fact that infrastructure projects have more uncertainty & typically higher risk premium. Cost of capital = Risk-free rate + Risk Premium.""

In her DCF calculation, Devina Mehra of First Global has taken various scenarios for her mathematical assumptions. If the cost of capital is raised to 12.50%, the Adani Enterprises share price may drop to ₹584 apiece. She went on to add that Adani Enterprises share price may further drop to ₹529 per share if the cost of capital is assumed at 13%.

""Of course, if you want to assume higher growth rates you can see those values as well. The elephant in the room and the reason why I stopped giving a lot of importance to DCF calculations in general? Almost all DCF models assume a company grows every year into perpetuity,"" Devina added. However, the investment expert maintained that in real life, not even 10% of the companies meet this test.

""Plus, as you see, DCF calculations are super sensitive to Terminal period growth & cost of capital assumptions- essentially means that you can justify virtually any value you wish to.""

In a tweet directed towards the beleaguered billionaire, Moitra said, “Oh & [by the way] Mr. Adani, Sir - don’t waste time sending all your Delhi stooges behind me .”

“I am NOT being funded by Reliance. Never met any Ambani, junior or senior in my life. Nor their employees,” she added. “Hard as you may find to believe, some of us are simply anti-market manipulation.”

The fiery Lok Sabha member has been aggressive on the ongoing controversy surrounding Gautam Adani and has expressed her “only regret” that the Opposition was not aggressive enough to bring up the ""Adani scandal"" a little earlier in 2021-22.

“I want to talk about the most famous person in India today... Unfortunately for this house, it is not the honourable Prime Minister. It is a man whose name starts with an “a” and ends with an “i, and no, it is not Advani. For the purposes of this speech, let me just call him Mr A and his group the A Company,” she said during her parliamentary intervention in Lok Sabha during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.

Mahua Moitra recently wrote a fresh missive to SEBI asking about the status of its investigation into Adani Group.

Opposition parties have been demanding a probe into allegations of fraud levelled against the Adani Group by American research firm, Hindenburg. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on used the discussion on the President’s address to attack the Centre over the sharp rise in the fortunes of the Adani Group, linking State foreign visits to global gains made by the tycoon, even as treasury benches hit back, asking for proof and blaming the Congress for past scams.

Complaints were made against Rahul Gandhi's February 7 parliamentary speech where he alleged that PM Modi was behind the success of Adani Group's owner Gautam Adani amid the report released by Hindenburg Research. To establish a relationship between them, he displayed a picture in the Lok Sabha where the multi-millionaire was seen sharing a space with the Prime Minister inside a private jet.

He further said that during his journey across the country in the Bharat Jodo Yatra, public asked him about Adani's sudden rise to success and reasons behind his expansion into several sectors.

“The youth asked us that Adani’s business is now in eight to ten sectors and how his net worth reached $140 billion from $8 billion between 2014 and 2022,” he said.

Earlier, Joshi, who is also the Union parliamentary affairs minister, wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker saying Rahul Gandhi mislead the House by levelling accusations with any documentary evidence. He further laid out the rules saying that a notice is required beforehand an MP makes any allegation another parliamentarian.

NEW DELHI/NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - India's Adani Group has appointed accountancy firm Grant Thornton for independent audits of some of its companies in a bid to discredit claims by short-seller Hindenburg Research that have battered its stocks and bonds, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

The appointment marks the first major effort by Adani Group to defend itself in the wake of a Jan. 24 report by Hindenburg that accused it of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation.

The conglomerate, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, has strongly denied the allegations but investors remain concerned. Shares in the group's seven listed subsidiaries have cumulatively lost about $120 billion in market value in the last three weeks.

Adani Group said last week it was considering independent evaluation of issues relating to legal compliance, related party transactions and internal controls following the Hindenburg report. The appointment of Grant Thornton is reported here for the first time.

Grant Thornton has been hired to conduct independent audits of some Adani Group companies, said the sources, declining to be named as the appointment is confidential.

One of the sources added that Grant Thornton would look at whether related-party transactions at the Adani Group complied with corporate governance standards.

Grant Thornton and Adani Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Adani Group sought to reassure investors on Monday, saying it had strong cashflows, its business plans were fully funded and that it was ""confident in the continued ability of our portfolio to deliver superior returns to shareholders.""

But regulatory pressure has been increasing. India's market regulator confirmed on Monday it was investigating the report by Hindenburg, as well as market activity immediately before and after the report was published.

The U.S. short-seller's report said it had identified numerous ""undisclosed related party transactions"" by both listed and private Adani companies, alleging it was in violation of Indian disclosure laws.

In its rebuttal, Adani had said ""all related party transactions are at arm's length, properly disclosed and reviewed/audited by statutory independent auditors.""

Around six Adani group companies were trading in the positive territory, while four were in the red.

On Monday, AEL reported a jump in its consolidated net profit at ₹820.06 crore in the third quarter of current financial year as compared to a loss of ₹11.63 crore in the same period a year ago. The company's revenue also soared 42 per cent to ₹26,612.33 crore.

Also, shares of Ambuja Cements were trading 3.30 per cent higher at ₹347.75 per piece on the BSE.

The conglomerate is looking to repay the bridge loan with cash this month, said the report, adding that the loan had a tenor of six months and was part of a larger $5.25 billion financing package.

The Adani group companies have been under pressure for the past three weeks and the group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses when US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research through its critical report accused the firm of fraudulent transactions and stock manipulation at the Gautam Adani-led group – allegations the company has denied.

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has downplayed the recent market volatility of Adani Group's shares as ""temporary."" His comments came Tuesday in the quarterly earnings release of Adani Enterprises, the flagship business of his conglomerate which spans ports, energy and media. The tycoon said the conglomerate's success was a result of its ""strong governance"" and ""strict regulatory compliance."" ""The current market volatility is temporary,"" Adani said. He added the conglomerate ""will continue to work with the twin objectives of moderate leverage and looking at strategic opportunities to expand and grow."" Shares of various Adani Group companies saw a massive sell-off after U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of ""brazen stock manipulation"" and ""accounting fraud."" The Adani Group has denied those accusations, and said it was a ""calculated attack on India.""

Adani flagship earnings

On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises reported a profit after tax of nearly $100 million for the October to December quarter. This was against a loss of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago. Total revenue grew 42% to $3.3 billion year-on-year, on the back of stellar performance in its airports, coal trading and new energy businesses.

Nobody wants to see Adani [Group] suddenly collapse because these infrastructure projects are big. The assets are good. They serve a mission critical purpose... Anand Batepati portfolio manager, GFM Focus Investing

""Over the past three decades, as well as quarter after quarter and year after year, Adani Enterprises has not only validated its standing as India's most successful infrastructure incubator, but has also demonstrated a track record of building core infrastructure business,"" said Adani in the results statement. Shares of Adani Enterprises last traded about 3% higher Wednesday on National Stock Exchange of India.

Despite the crisis, the Adani conglomerate is critical to India's growth story, said Anand Batepati, portfolio manager at GFM Focus Investing. ""Nobody wants to see Adani [Group] suddenly collapse because these infrastructure projects are big. The assets are good. They serve a mission critical purpose and they're aligned to all these development goals the government is shooting for,"" Batepati told CNBC's ""Streets Signs"" on Wednesday. ""So, I don't think the access to [Indian] capital markets, whether it's the banks or the rupee bond market, is going to be closed to Adani,"" added Batepati. ""It is possible though that there's going to be more scrutiny.""

Not a 'Lehman moment'

The Securities and Exchange Board of India is expected to meet Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday, to give an update on its investigations into the Adani Group, Reuters reported, citing sources. India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has also said ""the banking sector remains resilient and stable,"" citing its own assessment of the situation. The RBI said it will continue to monitor the stability of the industry.

Stocks bearing the Adani name appear in over 500 so-called Article 8 funds that are supposed to “promote"" ESG goals, provided that the companies in which the investments are made follow good governance practices under European Union rules, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

As many as 80 of those exposures are through direct holdings, while the remaining are mostly through funds of funds or index trackers, the data shows, which correct for duplicate holdings.

As the Adani Group companies get stripped from indexes and are put under review amid allegations of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation, ESG investors are once again left wondering why a strategy intended to shield against risks such as greenwashing and bad governance – often at an extra fee – didn’t protect them from the latest meltdown.

What are ESG funds

ESG funds are investments which make investment commitment based on environmental, social, and governance factors. A firm that makes investments in an ESG fund should be well-run and also have a positive impact on the environment and society as well.

Also, ESG funds seeks to benefit society and the environment while also producing financial returns.

ESG analysts believe that the strong headwinds faced by the Adani Group could impact access to offshore ESG-linked financing plans of other Indian firms.

An individual who tracks ESG investments has termed the Adani crisis as a bad omen for India’s green energy ambitions.

In the wake of a late January report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, the selloff in the Adani Group's seven listed subsidiaries have cumulatively lost about $120 billion in group market value in the last three weeks.

Funds with nearly $10 billion in assets under management tracking MSCI ESG indexes held shares in Adani Enterprises Ltd alone, as per an analysis by the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute. The institute has been studying the Adani Group since mid-2020.

In a report on Adani published on 9 February, Ulf Erlandsson, AFII’s chief executive officer, and Stephanie Mielnik, its head of fixed-income research, wrote: “Our view is that ESG investors with this unfortunate exposure should engage with their managers and, potentially, regulatory bodies that are better positioned to examine why this index-fund inclusion has occurred.""

Patrick Wood Uribe, the CEO of Util, an ESG research firm backed by private equity and venture capital investors, said the Adani debacle exposes some fundamental flaws in the approach adopted by several ESG index and ratings providers, as well as portfolio managers.

“There can be a very large mismatch with what investors are expecting,"" when they place their money in a company or a fund classified as ESG, Wood Uribe said in an interview. And by offering an “overly simplified view,"" ESG ratings end up doing a “disservice"" to investors, he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.

27% of Article 8 funds meet its sustainability requirement

In an effort to address such concerns, the European Securities and Markets Authority has proposed enforcing minimum thresholds that would require Article 8 managers to apply stricter standards to their ESG claims. A recent analysis by Morningstar Inc. found that if the ESMA proposal is adopted, only 27% of Article 8 funds would actually meet its sustainability requirement.

Adani companies were also held by 11 funds registered as Article 9, which is the EU’s highest ESG classification. Eight of these were through direct holdings, according to an analysis by Bloomberg. In order to justify an Article 9 designation under EU rules, a fund manager needs to prove that a portfolio is 100% sustainable, with allowances made for hedging and liquidity needs.

ESG fund managers are under “increasing pressure"" to be “much clearer with investors about what exactly they are offering and what it means,"" Util’s Wood Uribe said. There remains a “massive opportunity and a massive gap in actually meeting some of those sustainability objectives, actually delivering on what investors would like to see in terms of sustainable investment.""

Util also notes that Adani stock documents were replete with the kind of ESG verbiage that portfolio managers often look for. In its rebuttal of the Hindenburg report, Adani frequently cited the group’s adherence to ESG principles, and pointed to its adoption of multiple global ESG frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), among others.

Adani has denied all allegations, calling them ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"". It called Hindenburg the ""Madoffs of Manhattan"", referring to the late financier and fraudster Bernie Madoff.

ESG ratings firms, meanwhile, have given some corners of the Adani Group conspicuously high scores. Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Total Gas Ltd still carry an “A"" rating at MSCI Inc, according to data on the website of MSCI. Adani Transmission Ltd is rated “BBB.""

All three have lost more than a third of their value since the Hindenburg report was published. A spokesperson for MSCI said the firm is due to conduct a review of its ESG and climate indexes, which may include changes as early as this week.

“This is a conglomerate with operations in commodities, utilities, gas, and airports"" and one that is “engaged in some of the most controversial coal mining projects in recent history, including the largest open-pit coal mining operation,"" Wood Uribe said in a written analysis of the Adani group.

“Thanks to the ‘convoluted structures’ and ‘multiplicity of subsidiaries’ cited in the Hindenburg report, Adani has long been able to finance its dirtier operations with the proceeds of sustainable fund flows,"" he said.

Asia ESG funds global market share doubles

Meanwhile, in Asia, ESG funds have doubled their international market share as political and regulatory upheavals slow inflows for environmental, social and governance investing in the US and Europe.

Barclays Plc analysts including Dave Dai wrote in a note that Asia funds posted net inflows of 15% last year, as against 4% globally. That doubled Asia’s ESG fund market share to 4%, from 2% at the end of 2020, Barclays noted.

Asia’s net inflows into ESG stock and bond funds compared with 5% for non-ESG funds in the region, showing “stronger investor appetite for sustainable investing,"" the analysts further said.

The news has come weeks after the Adani Enterprises withdrew its Rs 20,000 crore follow on public offer amid steep fall in the group shares following dozens of allegations of wrongdoing by Hindenburg Research.

MSCI said it received feedback from “a range of market participants” concerning the eligibility and ability to determine the free float of Adani Group stock, following a previous announcement at the end of January.

In a statement, the index provider said: “MSCI has determined that the characteristics of certain investors have sufficient uncertainty that they should no longer be designated as free float pursuant to our methodology.

“This determination has triggered a free-float review of Adani Group securities.”

It said weighting cuts will be implemented at the end of February, triggering outflows of index investor money from Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC.

MSCI currently allocates to the four Adani Group companies in its all-country world (ACWI), emerging markets, Asia and India indices, with the latter weighting more than 3% to the group.

Following last week’s announcement, flagship company Adani Enterprises saw its shares fall 14.4% in two days, now down 51.8% so far this year, as at 10 February.

MSCI added it will suspend any potential changes to the number of shares for Adani Group companies and will review their status in its benchmarks at the May index review.

The recent update is just the latest blow to the group chaired by the former richest person in India, Gautam Adani, following accusations of fraud and stock price manipulation by short seller Hindenburg Research, which have cut the group’s value by $110bn.

Since news first broke last month, Adani’s conglomerate has been margin called by Barclays, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank on a $1.1bn share-backed loan. Adani was also forced to suspend a $2.5bn stock offering while TotalEnergies postponed a $4bn hydrogen power partnership with the firm.

Credit Suisse, Citi and Standard Chartered have also stopped accepting Adani Group stock and bonds as collateral on margin loans for all clients. Elsewhere, other index providers have responded, with FTSE Russell stating in January it would maintain allocations to Adani companies in its indices while they “remain eligible in accordance with the underlying index methodologies”.

Alex Matturri, former CEO of rival firm S&P Dow Jones Indices, said MSCI could be questioned for just now revising its free-float calculations for Adani Group companies.

“Interlocking ownerships are always complicated to understand and MSCI has plenty of experience in dealing with these situations,” Matturri said.

“As for other index providers, one cannot always assume that they are providing high quality data and thus accurate indices. Inadequate methodologies and operating policies can impact the quality and reliability of an index. The Adani issue will only increase regulators interest in wanting to regulate index providers. ”

Prior to MSCI’s announcement, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would delete Adani Enterprises from its sustainability indices.

Responding, ESG think-tank Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute (AFII), questioned why the company would have a place in any index provider’s sustainable range to start with.

“Why was Adani Enterprises, with documented governance, environmental and social issues, included in ‘sustainability’ or ‘ESG’ equity indices in the first place?

“This is not to single out SPDJI, MSCI and FTSE Russell have had [the company] in some of their emerging market-focused ESG indices as well, according to Bloomberg data.”

AFII said funds tracking MSCI ESG indices with over $10bn assets under management (AUM) have held the stock while it has had involvement in greenfield thermal coal mines.

REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo















NEW DELHI/NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - India's Adani Group has appointed accountancy firm Grant Thornton for independent audits of some of its companies in a bid to discredit claims by short-seller Hindenburg Research that have battered its stocks and bonds, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

The appointment marks the first major effort by Adani Group to defend itself in the wake of a Jan. 24 report by Hindenburg that accused it of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation.

The conglomerate, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, has strongly denied the allegations but investors remain concerned. Shares in the group's seven listed subsidiaries have cumulatively lost about $120 billion in market value in the last three weeks.

Adani Group said last week it was considering independent evaluation of issues relating to legal compliance, related party transactions and internal controls following the Hindenburg report. The appointment of Grant Thornton is reported here for the first time.

Grant Thornton has been hired to conduct independent audits of some Adani Group companies, said the sources, declining to be named as the appointment is confidential.

One of the sources added that Grant Thornton would look at whether related-party transactions at the Adani Group complied with corporate governance standards.

Grant Thornton and Adani Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Adani Group sought to reassure investors on Monday, saying it had strong cashflows, its business plans were fully funded and that it was ""confident in the continued ability of our portfolio to deliver superior returns to shareholders.""

But regulatory pressure has been increasing. India's market regulator confirmed on Monday it was investigating the report by Hindenburg, as well as market activity immediately before and after the report was published.

The U.S. short-seller's report said it had identified numerous ""undisclosed related party transactions"" by both listed and private Adani companies, alleging it was in violation of Indian disclosure laws.

In its rebuttal, Adani had said ""all related party transactions are at arm's length, properly disclosed and reviewed/audited by statutory independent auditors.""

Around six Adani group companies were trading in the positive territory, while four were in the red.

On Monday, AEL reported a jump in its consolidated net profit at ₹820.06 crore in the third quarter of current financial year as compared to a loss of ₹11.63 crore in the same period a year ago. The company's revenue also soared 42 per cent to ₹26,612.33 crore.

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has downplayed the recent market volatility of Adani Group's shares as ""temporary."" His comments came Tuesday in the quarterly earnings release of Adani Enterprises, the flagship business of his conglomerate which spans ports, energy and media. The tycoon said the conglomerate's success was a result of its ""strong governance"" and ""strict regulatory compliance."" ""The current market volatility is temporary,"" Adani said. He added the conglomerate ""will continue to work with the twin objectives of moderate leverage and looking at strategic opportunities to expand and grow."" Shares of various Adani Group companies saw a massive sell-off after U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of ""brazen stock manipulation"" and ""accounting fraud."" The Adani Group has denied those accusations, and said it was a ""calculated attack on India.""

Adani flagship earnings

On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises reported a profit after tax of nearly $100 million for the October to December quarter. This was against a loss of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago. Total revenue grew 42% to $3.3 billion year-on-year, on the back of stellar performance in its airports, coal trading and new energy businesses.

Nobody wants to see Adani [Group] suddenly collapse because these infrastructure projects are big. The assets are good. They serve a mission critical purpose... Anand Batepati portfolio manager, GFM Focus Investing

""Over the past three decades, as well as quarter after quarter and year after year, Adani Enterprises has not only validated its standing as India's most successful infrastructure incubator, but has also demonstrated a track record of building core infrastructure business,"" said Adani in the results statement. Shares of Adani Enterprises last traded about 3% higher Wednesday on National Stock Exchange of India.

Despite the crisis, the Adani conglomerate is critical to India's growth story, said Anand Batepati, portfolio manager at GFM Focus Investing. ""Nobody wants to see Adani [Group] suddenly collapse because these infrastructure projects are big. The assets are good. They serve a mission critical purpose and they're aligned to all these development goals the government is shooting for,"" Batepati told CNBC's ""Streets Signs"" on Wednesday. ""So, I don't think the access to [Indian] capital markets, whether it's the banks or the rupee bond market, is going to be closed to Adani,"" added Batepati. ""It is possible though that there's going to be more scrutiny.""

Not a 'Lehman moment'

The Securities and Exchange Board of India is expected to meet Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday, to give an update on its investigations into the Adani Group, Reuters reported, citing sources. India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has also said ""the banking sector remains resilient and stable,"" citing its own assessment of the situation. The RBI said it will continue to monitor the stability of the industry.

Stocks bearing the Adani name appear in over 500 so-called Article 8 funds that are supposed to “promote"" ESG goals, provided that the companies in which the investments are made follow good governance practices under European Union rules, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

As many as 80 of those exposures are through direct holdings, while the remaining are mostly through funds of funds or index trackers, the data shows, which correct for duplicate holdings.

As the Adani Group companies get stripped from indexes and are put under review amid allegations of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation, ESG investors are once again left wondering why a strategy intended to shield against risks such as greenwashing and bad governance – often at an extra fee – didn’t protect them from the latest meltdown.

What are ESG funds

ESG funds are investments which make investment commitment based on environmental, social, and governance factors. A firm that makes investments in an ESG fund should be well-run and also have a positive impact on the environment and society as well.

Also, ESG funds seeks to benefit society and the environment while also producing financial returns.

ESG analysts believe that the strong headwinds faced by the Adani Group could impact access to offshore ESG-linked financing plans of other Indian firms.

An individual who tracks ESG investments has termed the Adani crisis as a bad omen for India’s green energy ambitions.

In the wake of a late January report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, the selloff in the Adani Group's seven listed subsidiaries have cumulatively lost about $120 billion in group market value in the last three weeks.

Funds with nearly $10 billion in assets under management tracking MSCI ESG indexes held shares in Adani Enterprises Ltd alone, as per an analysis by the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute. The institute has been studying the Adani Group since mid-2020.

In a report on Adani published on 9 February, Ulf Erlandsson, AFII’s chief executive officer, and Stephanie Mielnik, its head of fixed-income research, wrote: “Our view is that ESG investors with this unfortunate exposure should engage with their managers and, potentially, regulatory bodies that are better positioned to examine why this index-fund inclusion has occurred.""

Patrick Wood Uribe, the CEO of Util, an ESG research firm backed by private equity and venture capital investors, said the Adani debacle exposes some fundamental flaws in the approach adopted by several ESG index and ratings providers, as well as portfolio managers.

“There can be a very large mismatch with what investors are expecting,"" when they place their money in a company or a fund classified as ESG, Wood Uribe said in an interview. And by offering an “overly simplified view,"" ESG ratings end up doing a “disservice"" to investors, he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.

27% of Article 8 funds meet its sustainability requirement

In an effort to address such concerns, the European Securities and Markets Authority has proposed enforcing minimum thresholds that would require Article 8 managers to apply stricter standards to their ESG claims. A recent analysis by Morningstar Inc. found that if the ESMA proposal is adopted, only 27% of Article 8 funds would actually meet its sustainability requirement.

Adani companies were also held by 11 funds registered as Article 9, which is the EU’s highest ESG classification. Eight of these were through direct holdings, according to an analysis by Bloomberg. In order to justify an Article 9 designation under EU rules, a fund manager needs to prove that a portfolio is 100% sustainable, with allowances made for hedging and liquidity needs.

ESG fund managers are under “increasing pressure"" to be “much clearer with investors about what exactly they are offering and what it means,"" Util’s Wood Uribe said. There remains a “massive opportunity and a massive gap in actually meeting some of those sustainability objectives, actually delivering on what investors would like to see in terms of sustainable investment.""

Util also notes that Adani stock documents were replete with the kind of ESG verbiage that portfolio managers often look for. In its rebuttal of the Hindenburg report, Adani frequently cited the group’s adherence to ESG principles, and pointed to its adoption of multiple global ESG frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), among others.

Adani has denied all allegations, calling them ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"". It called Hindenburg the ""Madoffs of Manhattan"", referring to the late financier and fraudster Bernie Madoff.

ESG ratings firms, meanwhile, have given some corners of the Adani Group conspicuously high scores. Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Total Gas Ltd still carry an “A"" rating at MSCI Inc, according to data on the website of MSCI. Adani Transmission Ltd is rated “BBB.""

All three have lost more than a third of their value since the Hindenburg report was published. A spokesperson for MSCI said the firm is due to conduct a review of its ESG and climate indexes, which may include changes as early as this week.

“This is a conglomerate with operations in commodities, utilities, gas, and airports"" and one that is “engaged in some of the most controversial coal mining projects in recent history, including the largest open-pit coal mining operation,"" Wood Uribe said in a written analysis of the Adani group.

“Thanks to the ‘convoluted structures’ and ‘multiplicity of subsidiaries’ cited in the Hindenburg report, Adani has long been able to finance its dirtier operations with the proceeds of sustainable fund flows,"" he said.

Asia ESG funds global market share doubles

Meanwhile, in Asia, ESG funds have doubled their international market share as political and regulatory upheavals slow inflows for environmental, social and governance investing in the US and Europe.

Barclays Plc analysts including Dave Dai wrote in a note that Asia funds posted net inflows of 15% last year, as against 4% globally. That doubled Asia’s ESG fund market share to 4%, from 2% at the end of 2020, Barclays noted.

Asia’s net inflows into ESG stock and bond funds compared with 5% for non-ESG funds in the region, showing “stronger investor appetite for sustainable investing,"" the analysts further said.

The news has come weeks after the Adani Enterprises withdrew its Rs 20,000 crore follow on public offer amid steep fall in the group shares following dozens of allegations of wrongdoing by Hindenburg Research.

As per the ET report, the quantum of investments has not yet been finalised, but sources told ET the group was looking at a $1-$1.5 billion infusion of 'confidence capital.'

At 11 am, shares of Adani Enterprises were trading 2.19 per cent lower at Rs 1,680. Adani Ports, which was trading lower in early trade, recovered and was trading at Rs 560.25, up 1.27 per cent.

Meanwhile, Sebi is probing the allegations made by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group and the market activity before and after the publication of the report, the market regulator told the Supreme Court on Monday. During a hearing by the apex court on volatility in Adani stocks, Sebi said the matter was in the early stages of examination, so it may not be appropriate to list details about the ongoing proceedings at this stage.

MSCI said it received feedback from “a range of market participants” concerning the eligibility and ability to determine the free float of Adani Group stock, following a previous announcement at the end of January.

In a statement, the index provider said: “MSCI has determined that the characteristics of certain investors have sufficient uncertainty that they should no longer be designated as free float pursuant to our methodology.

“This determination has triggered a free-float review of Adani Group securities.”

It said weighting cuts will be implemented at the end of February, triggering outflows of index investor money from Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC.

MSCI currently allocates to the four Adani Group companies in its all-country world (ACWI), emerging markets, Asia and India indices, with the latter weighting more than 3% to the group.

Following last week’s announcement, flagship company Adani Enterprises saw its shares fall 14.4% in two days, now down 51.8% so far this year, as at 10 February.

MSCI added it will suspend any potential changes to the number of shares for Adani Group companies and will review their status in its benchmarks at the May index review.

The recent update is just the latest blow to the group chaired by the former richest person in India, Gautam Adani, following accusations of fraud and stock price manipulation by short seller Hindenburg Research, which have cut the group’s value by $110bn.

Since news first broke last month, Adani’s conglomerate has been margin called by Barclays, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank on a $1.1bn share-backed loan. Adani was also forced to suspend a $2.5bn stock offering while TotalEnergies postponed a $4bn hydrogen power partnership with the firm.

Credit Suisse, Citi and Standard Chartered have also stopped accepting Adani Group stock and bonds as collateral on margin loans for all clients. Elsewhere, other index providers have responded, with FTSE Russell stating in January it would maintain allocations to Adani companies in its indices while they “remain eligible in accordance with the underlying index methodologies”.

Alex Matturri, former CEO of rival firm S&P Dow Jones Indices, said MSCI could be questioned for just now revising its free-float calculations for Adani Group companies.

“Interlocking ownerships are always complicated to understand and MSCI has plenty of experience in dealing with these situations,” Matturri said.

“As for other index providers, one cannot always assume that they are providing high quality data and thus accurate indices. Inadequate methodologies and operating policies can impact the quality and reliability of an index. The Adani issue will only increase regulators interest in wanting to regulate index providers. ”

Prior to MSCI’s announcement, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would delete Adani Enterprises from its sustainability indices.

Responding, ESG think-tank Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute (AFII), questioned why the company would have a place in any index provider’s sustainable range to start with.

“Why was Adani Enterprises, with documented governance, environmental and social issues, included in ‘sustainability’ or ‘ESG’ equity indices in the first place?

“This is not to single out SPDJI, MSCI and FTSE Russell have had [the company] in some of their emerging market-focused ESG indices as well, according to Bloomberg data.”

AFII said funds tracking MSCI ESG indices with over $10bn assets under management (AUM) have held the stock while it has had involvement in greenfield thermal coal mines.

Modi and Adani probably share the closest relationship a politician can have with a business person. Ashok Swain Uppsala University

Hindenburg's report has further sharpened the focus on the billionaire mogul's close ties with Modi. ""Adani has pulled off this gargantuan feat with the help of enablers in government and a cottage industry of international companies that facilitate these activities. These issues of corruption permeate multiple layers of government,"" the report alleged. In a rebuttal that ran over 400 pages, the Adani Group rejected those allegations calling it a ""calculated attack on India."" The company did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. The Prime Minister's office did not respond to a request for comment.

India has always struggled with ""crony capitalism,"" but the cozy relationship between Modi and Adani has ""taken it to a different level,"" according to Ashok Swain, head of the department of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden.

""Modi and Adani probably share the closest relationship a politician can have with a business person; certainly, it had never happened in India. Their rise has been together,"" added Swain, a veteran observer of Indian politics. Adani's family-owned conglomerate spans from airports and maritime ports to coal and renewable energy and more recently, media. India's ""chosen growth model"" requires a ""certain degree of crony capitalism,"" said Milan Vaishnav, South Asia director at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Vaishnav added the Modi government's industrial policy is premised on building up national champions in industry, and Adani has been the ""poster child to date."" ""There's no question that Adani enjoys this position today at least in part because of his proximity to the prime minister,"" he said, ""but also because of a perception that he is able to execute on projects at scale.""

A 'fruitful relationship'

The relationship between Adani and Modi is longstanding. Both men hail from India's Western state of Gujarat, where Modi was the chief minister in 2001. Adani was an early supporter of Modi's political aspirations and championed the Indian leader's growth vision for India. Modi flew in an Adani jet after he was elected to national office in 2014.

""That Adani and Modi forged a close bond during their years in Gujarat is an open secret,"" noted Vaishnav. ""There is no question that the fortunes of these two men are connected,"" he said, ""especially in the past few years as the government has ramped up capital expenditure as it makes a concerted push on infrastructure."" The Adani Group is a key player in Modi's ambition to transform India into a $5 trillion economy, said Alim Remtulla of Medley Advisors.

Both men embody the ""Gujarat growth model,"" he said, referring to the embrace of close relations between big business and government. ""Specifically, infrastructure is a key element to Modi's nation-building plans. Adani [Group] is one of the few firms in the country that can deliver on these major infrastructure projects across the country,"" Remtulla told CNCB's ""Squawk Box Asia."" ""Similarly, for Adani, he needs the implicit backing of Modi to raise funds for these capital-intensive projects. So this is a long and fruitful relationship that goes back decades,"" he said.

Opposition attacks

Hindenburg's report turned out to be a political gift for India's opposition, which for years has railed against Modi for his links with Adani. With national elections looming next year, opposition critics have seized on the report to attack Modi and his party. India's main opposition Congress party has staged protests and demanded a probe over Hindenburg's allegations. Opposition critics have also accused Mod's government of giving unfair favors to Adani's business empire. ""The entire country has observed a close connection between the Adani Group's commercial interests and your [Modi's] eagerness to help him using government policy. This pattern is consistent across sectors ranging from agriculture to energy to transportation,"" Jairam Ramesh, the Congress party's general secretary, said in a statement last week.

In 2018, the Modi government reportedly changed rules that allowed Adani to bid — and eventually win — tenders for six airports. It was met with outrage amid criticism of cronyism. The government has rejected those allegations. After Modi became prime minister, Adani continued to benefit from the relationship but on a much larger scale, said Swain. ""Besides giving licenses for the airports and ports, changing the environmental rules for Adani's coal mines, and tweaking the rules to favor Adani's stakes in special economic zones, Modi has helped Adani's businesses in many ways,"" he said. In his address to parliament last week, the prime minister seemed unfazed by the opposition's criticism and made no mention of Adani.

""The blessings of 1.4 billion countrymen are my biggest 'suraksha kavach,'"" Modi said, using a Hindi term meaning ""safety shield."" ""And you can never breach this safety shield with the weapons of abuse and lies,"" he said, as opposition lawmakers chanted ""Adani, Adani."" Adani has rejected claims that he gained personal favors from Modi, calling such allegations baseless. ""Prime Minister Modi and I are from the same state. That makes me an easy target for such baseless allegation,"" said the tycoon, according to a January report in India Today. ""My professional success is not because of any individual leader but because of the policy and institutional reforms initiated by several leaders and governments over a long period of more than three decades,"" he said in the report.

In response to Hindenburg’s allegations, Adani Group issued a 413-page reply calling the short-sellers claims “stale, baseless, and discredited allegations.”

But the allegations have nevertheless had an immediate knock-on effect, with more than $100 billion wiped from the group’s market value, as well as Gautam Adani losing his status as both Asia and India’s richest man. Adani Group also canceled a $2.5 billion share sale, pledging to refund its investors. Adani said that the group’s balance sheet was “healthy and assets robust” in a video statement after the sale was called off, adding that the group has an “impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations”.

This week, India’s markets regulator confirmed in a Supreme Court filing that it would be investigating the allegations and studying “market activity” around the report. The continued scrutiny of Adani group has led many to wonder what will happen next.

What has the fallout been for the Adani Group so far?

The most obvious fallout of the Hindenberg report has been a loss of confidence in Adani Group from both investors and analysts, who are now keeping an eye on how the stock prices will impact the company’s operations, cash flow, and expansion plans. This means that many of the company’s projects might need to be “heavily scaled back” due to the lack of fundraising, Tim Buckley, the director at Climate Energy Finance, told the BBC.

As lenders feel more cautious about Adani Group, it’s uncertain whether the company will be able to continue funding its projects and acquisitions by borrowing more money, especially since it is already steeped in total debt of nearly 2 trillion rupees ($24 billion dollars) after borrowing heavily from overseas bonds, foreign and Indian banks, and the state-owned insurance firm, Life Insurance Corporation of India.

So far, two big banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, have stopped accepting Adani bonds as collateral, according to Bloomberg. Other lenders including Barclays and Deutsche Bank asked for a margin call on a $1.1 billion share-backed loan. Elara Capital Funds, another global investment bank in the U.K. with reported links to Adani, saw one high-profile board director resign earlier this month. Lord Jo Johnson, the younger brother of former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, told reporters: “I now recognize that this is a role that requires greater domain expertise in specialized areas of financial regulation than I anticipated and, accordingly, I have resigned from the board.” Adani Group has denied having any relationship with Elara Capital.

Still, others, including two European private banks, are continuing to lend against Adani’s debt.

In other global developments, MSCI, a global index provider, is also set to change its weightings for Adani Group stocks after reviewing how many of its shares can be freely traded.

France’s TotalEnergies paused a planned $4 billion hydrogen project with the group, while Bangladeshi officials have asked for a discount on electricity purchased from Adani’s power, according to a public stock exchange filing. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund also sold its stakes in three Adani Group companies worth just over $200 million. “Since year-end, we have further reduced in Adani companies. We have no exposure left,” Christopher Wright, the fund’s head of ESG risk monitoring, told a news conference.

What will Indian regulators do in response?

India’s market regulator, also known as the Securities and Exchange Board of India, or SEBI, said it would increase its scrutiny of Adani Group’s deals and foreign portfolio investors. It plans to study the Hindenburg report to add to its own ongoing preliminary investigation. “SEBI has been increasingly examining all the transactions that Adani Group has been undertaking in the listed space,” an anonymous source told Reuters. SEBI also asked for disclosures that it usually wouldn’t ask for while looking into possible irregularities over a previous share sale.

The Reserve Bank of India also asked the country’s lenders to submit information about their exposure to Adani Group, with a handful of Indian banks publicly disclosing how much credit they had extended to Adani’s various companies at the end of last year. On Feb. 7, CreditSights published a round-up which found that so far, the risk was “manageable” at the end of last year.

The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is perceived to have close ties to Adani, has largely stayed silent on the matter. The country’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, told reporters that regulators would “do their job” in response to the allegations and insisted that “our macroeconomic fundamentals, our economy’s image . . . none of [it] has been affected”.

In a parliamentary hearing on Feb. 7, Randeep Singh Surjewala, a member of parliament from Congress, India’s main opposition party, questioned the government’s “loud silence.”

“Why is the government avoiding a discussion on the Adani scam? Why are the Finance Minister and PM Modi not coming to the Parliament? Why was the country’s wealth, LIC and SBI’s money invested in Adani’s sinking companies?” he asked.

What lessons can be learned from the Adani saga?

Aswath Damodaran, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, writes that the Adani allegations have demonstrated that many of the banking and regulatory institutions involved displayed “inertia and indifference” rather than “venality and corruption.”

According to him, stock market regulators in India are driven by the “best of intentions” but are more focused on protecting retail investors—who are most likely to be caught up in scams—than letting them lose their money. Moreover, he argues that Indian banks have historically felt more comfortable lending to family conglomerates like Adani than standalone enterprises because of their large social networks and a widespread perception that having the family’s reputation at stake will force it to repay its loans.

The larger lesson from the Adani story is more about how Adani Group was able to exploit the seams and weakest links to its advantage—especially through green bonds issuances, or ESGs: “In fact, if Adani happens to default on its debt, I hope that it starts with the green bondholders since I cannot think of a group that deserves default more,” Damodaran wrote.

Trinh Nguyen, a Senior Asia Economist at Natixis, also weighed in on Twitter by saying that the Adani Group allegations weren’t a major threat to India itself, since much of Adani’s valuations were owned by the family, who would therefore incur the biggest loss.

She added that the focus on India’s dependence on family-owned conglomerates was a good thing because it meant that corporate governance can improve with more scrutiny and more diversified private investors. “I don’t think we’re looking at any systemic risk here but we also need to analyze this as an opportunity to change for the better,” she wrote.

As India looks to host the G20 later this year, Amitabh Kant, the head of the summit, agreed with this sentiment. He told reporters that the scrutiny on Adani was a lesson for everyone: “We should believe in top-class governance and we should open our books and records to everyone in the world.”

The Congress on Monday asked why the Narendra Modi government cannot agree to a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to probe the Hindenburg Research report’s allegations against the Adani Group if it could agree to set up a committee before the Supreme Court.

Party’s general secretary (communication) Jairam Ramesh, in a tweet, also asked if the proposed committee of experts would examine the New York-based Hindenburg Research or the Adani Group.

“Today in Supreme Court Solicitor General said Govt has no objection to a committee to examine the Hindenburg report on Adani. Then why the stubborn refusal to a JPC which will anyway be dominated by BJP & its allies? But will the proposed committee investigate Hindenburg or Adani?” asked Mr. Ramesh.

Separately, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote to Speaker Om Birla over the privilege notice served on former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi over his February 7 Lok Sabha speech and comments made against Mr. Modi.

Stating that the stock market crashed and thousands of crores of investors’ wealth got eroded because of the ‘wrong policies’ of the business house, Mr. Chowdhury said Mr. Gandhi fulfilled his duty as a ‘public representative’.

‘Public interest’

“The issue was raised in “public interest” and for the service of the nation,” Mr. Chowdhury said, adding that BJP leaders who make derogatory remarks against members of the Gandhi-Nehru family were “never admonished or reprimanded”.

In a related development, the Congress also posed a series of questions to Prime Minister Modi under the Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun series.

Mr. Ramesh alleged that as far back as 2007, the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), while conducting an investigation into the volatility of stocks of Adani Exports (now Adani Enterprise) had found that “entities associated with notorious stock manipulator Ketan Parekh (KP) had indulged in manipulative activities such as synchronised trading/circular trading and creation of artificial volume to influence the price in the scrip of Adani”.

“Why did SEBI tolerate an even more extreme rise in Adani Group stock prices after 2020 without investigating it with the required seriousness?” Mr. Ramesh asked, adding that “a close relative of Mr. Parekh may be still maintaining links with the Adani group.”

He further added that both Congress and BJP governments, in the past, have formed JPCs to probe stock manipulation. While the Harshad Mehta scam was investigated in 1992 by the Congress government, the Ketan Parekh manipulations were investigated in 2001 under a BJP government.

“What are you afraid of? Do you fear that a truly independent investigation might implicate you personally in the Adani Group’s wrongdoings?” asked Mr. Ramesh.

The issue of Adani Group was also raised in the Lok Sabha by Congress member Manish Tewari while speaking on power generation in Punjab and procurement of coal from the Mahanadi Coalfields during the Zero Hour.

“If that coal is brought directly to Punjab via rail road the distance that it has to travel is 1,830 km. The Power Ministry wrote a letter to the Punjab government on November 30, 2022, and said it cannot get the coal directly via rail road and will have to take the coal to Paradeep port, then take the water route passing by Sri Lanka and reach the Adani ports in Dahej and Mundra, and then from there take the coal 1,500 km via rail road to Punjab,” Mr. Tewari claimed.

Alleging discrimination against Punjab and its people to benefit the Adani Group, he added, ”The cost of coal transportation has gone up from ₹4,350 per tonne to ₹6,750 per tonne. The cost of 1KW power has increased from ₹3.6 to ₹5”.","Party’s general secretary (communication) Jairam Ramesh, in a tweet, also asked if the proposed committee of experts would examine the New York-based Hindenburg Research or the Adani Group.

The two group companies have about 50 billion rupees ($605 million) worth of CP due to mature through March, data shows, while exchange data shows the flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd has redeemed a total of 2.5 billion rupees of CP since Jan. 25.

That is a day after U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation – allegations the group has denied – that sparked about a $120 billion loss in the group's market value on concerns including about its ability to refinance debt.

Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd regularly raise funds by issuing CPs – short-term debt instruments issued to meet working capital requirements.

""We will repay the CPs as and when they mature and are currently not looking to tap the short-term debt market,"" an official with one of the companies said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

The official said payments are being made as the securities mature and the company has not got any requests for early redemptions.

""All payments are being made as per schedule,"" an Adani group spokesperson said in an e-mail, but did not respond to queries on whether investors are seeking early redemption.

Adani Ports has CPs worth 35 billion rupees due to mature through end March, data from information service provider Prime Database showed.

Adani Enterprises has CP worth close to 15 billion rupees due to mature over February-March and more than 2 billion rupees worth due for redemption from April through January 2024, the data showed.

The Adani Group is unlikely to roll over this debt as it comes due, two bankers said on condition of anonymity as they are not permitted to speak to the media.

""Market sentiment is such that people will be cautious to immediately roll over CPs, and would prefer to cash out. So, we may see them (Adani Group) staying away from the market for some time,"" said one banker, who regularly arranges debt issuances for the group.

A second banker, who advises the conglomerate on local borrowings, added the group has not reached out to its bankers asking for a rollover.

""The Adani group generally gets in touch with bankers some days prior to the maturing CPs but has stopped any sort of intimation, hinting that they may look to repay the existing CP holders,"" this person said.

Apart from short-term borrowings, Adani Enterprises has not moved forward with plans to launch its debut retail bond issue of up to 10 billion rupees, while Adani Green Energy Ltd has also stayed put on a planned 1.5-billion rupee, 10-year bond offering, according to bankers, including the two mentioned earlier.

""There's been no communication from the companies on previously proposed bond issuances,"" said a merchant banker with a brokerage firm and directly involved in the arrangement.

The Adani Group spokesperson denied media reports that these bond issues have been scrapped, saying this is ""speculation"" and ""not true"" in a reply to Reuters' mail.","Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd regularly raise funds by issuing CPs – short-term debt instruments issued to meet working capital requirements.

Led by billionaire Gautam Adani, the business house’s seven listed companies bearing his name have together lost about $120bn in market value since a January 24 report by Hindenburg Research alleged improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation. The Adani group has denied the allegations and threatened legal action against Hindenburg.

“The Supreme Court has taken cognisance of the matter. As a minister, if the Supreme Court is seized of the matter it is not right for me to comment,” Amit Shah, widely considered the most powerful politician in India after Modi, told the ANI news agency.

“But in this, there is nothing for the BJP to hide and nothing to be afraid of,” Shah added, referring to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Shares of Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship, fell nearly 4 percent in early trade. The company, which pulled a $2.5bn share sale earlier this month after the stock rout, will announce quarterly results later in the day.

India’s Economic Times daily reported on Tuesday that Adani group executives had been holding negotiations since last week with Abu Dhabi’s International Holding Company (IHC) for capital infusion into Adani Enterprises or other group entities.

Should Gautam Adani take a business tip from Vallabh, an amiable young man who owns and runs a small eatery in Panjim, Goa?

In 1988 Gautam Adani founded Adani Enterprises which, in the span of 34 years, registered a meteoric rise that made him the third richest man in the world.

Then last month, out of the blue, came a devastating lightning bolt. A US-based short seller called the Hindenburg Research accused the Adani empire of all manner of financial skulduggery, including stock manipulation and fraudulent accounting, which torpedoed the conglomerate’s market valuation. Adani lost 50% of his wealth in 10 days, and fell from being the third richest man on the planet in January to the 17th richest in early February, practically a pauper in relative terms.

The Adani group has rebutted all charges of wrongdoing on its part, and has countered by saying that outfits like the Hindenburg Research make money by ‘short selling’, bringing down the value of a company’s shares, then offloading the cut-price stock at a profit, and as such their alleged findings are suspect.

But could there be a different reason behind the Adani meltdown? Has the group – which has fingers in pies as varied as coal and oil exploration, to airports and road building, to cement manufacture and financial services – diversified too much, too rapidly?

If so, Adani should look at the business model on which Vallabh runs his hugely successful Ashok Restaurant in Panjim, an establishment started by his father in 1954, and which has just one item on its menu: xacuti, the coconut-flavoured Goan curry. Customers can choose between chicken or mutton xacuti, take it or leave it. And customers take it, so much so that Vallabh shuts shop by early evening, having run out of supplies.

Vallabh’s wife mixes the spices, and Vallabh does the cooking, to produce what many claim is the best xacuti in the whole of Goa.

Vallabh’s tip for Adani? Stick to one thing, stick to your core competence. Stick to your knitting. Or your xacuti.

Since then, several questions have been raised on short selling – if it’s ethical, how it’s done, is it legal in India, etc.

Two petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court on this matter. One of them asked the top court to make ‘short selling’ an offence of fraud. Both the petitions raised similar concerns on how short selling affects innocent investors and asked the court to investigate the contents of the report.

The Union government on February 13 agreed to set up a panel to improve regulatory mechanisms.

What is short selling?

Short selling involves borrowing stock you do not own, selling the borrowed stock, and then buying and returning the stock only if and when the price drops.

It’s completely opposite to how a bullish transaction takes place. In such transactions, you buy a stock hoping the price will go up. You wait until it goes up to a certain extent.

However, short selling is mostly done to earn in a falling market. In this case, the investor is bearish on the markets.

For instance, an investor borrows a certain number of shares from a broker, and sells these shares in the market for Rs 100. In the future, when the price of the shares fall to Rs 80, then the investor can buy them at a lesser price, return them to the broker, thereby making a profit of Rs 20.

Investors short sell (or short) when they believe a stock is overvalued and expect the stock price to go down. And, according to a podcast on the Economist, that’s what attracted Hindenburg Research to dig into the Adani Group stocks.

Hindenburg said that the Adani Group has “substantial debt” and that the stock prices of the listed companies are overvalued by 85%.

This is how a financial system offers investors a mechanism to express negative views of stocks, bonds, etc. and let them generate profits if their forecast turns out to be correct.

How is short selling done in India?

“At present, in a realistic sense, there is no short selling in India,” Ajay Shah, markets expert, who was a member of the SEBI committee on the evolution of markets, told The Wire.

Shah, who’s the co-author of Indian Financial Markets: An Insider’s Guide to How the Markets Work, asked me to be careful with using the word ‘short selling’ in the Indian markets’ context.

This is because actual short selling – which involves borrowing shares for a multi-day horizon – is absent in India.

However, there’s severe confusion around the terminology of this word in India.

Shah explained this subject with the help of methods and examples.

The first step requires a speculator who has a negative view of a share price while not owning the shares herself.

1. For any stock, it’s possible to sell it within the day. Now, all open positions at the end of the day have to be settled, and that would not work because the speculator does not own the stock.

Therefore, the short seller has to sell intraday, hoping that her forecast works out correctly, and buy back within the same day before trading ends.

In an ideal event, the speculator, for instance, will sell at 2 pm when the stock is trading at Rs 100, buy it back at Rs 90 at 4 pm, and there’s a clean profit of Rs 10 within two hours for forecasting the price of the stock correctly.

This is colloquially called ‘short selling’, but this is strictly not a correct moniker, Shah said.

2. The second method is true short selling. This involves borrowing shares for multi-day horizons. The speculator goes to the market and sells the shares she does not own.

When the time comes to take the delivery of the shares, she goes to some institutional investor and borrows the requisite shares.

This generally requires paying an interest rate for the privilege of borrowing and also submitting a collateral to ensure that there is no risk of default.

Some days or weeks later, the speculator will buy back the shares from the market and return them to the lender, and earn a profit.

In an ideal event, what would happen is, for instance, you sell today at Rs 100, and deliver based on borrowed shares. In a month, you buy it back at Rs 90, and some of the raw profit of Rs 10 goes away as the interest cost of borrowing the shares for a month.

“This method is absent in India, but is amply prevalent elsewhere in the world,” Shah told The Wire.

“I think Hindenburg may have short sold Adani Group bonds in the US in this fashion,” he added.

3. The third method is the use of stock futures. An investor expresses a negative view of the stock by selling the futures.

[Futures are financial derivative instruments used to buy or sell a specific commodity asset or security at a set future date for a set price. If the price of the underlying asset (for example, Reliance Industries share) increases, then the price of the derivative (Reliance futures contract) also increases.

Suppose the price of a Reliance Industries share is Rs 2,000. And a Reliance futures contract is currently selling at Rs 2,186. You expect the price of the share will go up after, say, three weeks, so you buy a futures contract. But you don’t need to pay for it right away. You make the payment only when squaring off the futures contract on the specified date.]

When an investor has a negative view of a stock, she will sell the stock futures.

In an ideal scenario, Shah explained, she will sell the futures at Rs 100 and buy them back some days later at Rs 90 and make a clean profit of Rs 10. This process also requires posting a collateral, he added.

“Here also, the phrase ‘shorting the futures’ is used colloquially but this is not ‘short selling’, it’s just futures trading,” he said.

4. The fourth method uses the options. There are many ways in which an option position can express a negative view. For instance, an investor can buy put options, which gain in value when the price goes down. But this is also not called ‘short selling’.

What is ‘naked short selling’?

Ordinarily, traders must first borrow a stock before they sell it short.

However, in naked short selling, which is now illegal, stocks are not borrowed. Therefore, in times of panic, more people could dump their holdings, without any obligation to fulfil their settlements, thereby pushing the prices of the stock further down.

In short selling, for instance, if an investor has sold a number of shares she borrowed from a broker, she must, sooner or later, ‘close’ the short by buying back the same number of shares.

For instance, if you sold a stock at Rs 100, in the hope that the price will go down, but on the contrary, it increases to Rs 120, then you’ll have to buy it at a loss of Rs 20. Basically, you’ll have to complete the settlement.

After the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prohibited naked short selling.

According to CNBCTV18, in September 2008, the US SEC had temporarily banned short sales in nearly 1,000 financial stocks to halt the free fall in prices. Following this, stock prices recovered for a brief period but continued to decline for the rest of the period when the short sale ban was in effect.

However, months later, SEC chairman Christopher Cox had regretted the decision, saying “the costs appear to outweigh the benefits.”

[If you’ve seen the movie The Big Short, which is an adaptation of author Michael Lewis’s best-selling book of the same name, Michael Burry (Christian Bale), the manager of hedge fund Scion Capital, bets on the booming housing market. He shorts the housing markets assuming that the prices would fall. The collapse of the US housing market led to the 2008 financial crisis.]

What did Hindenburg short in Adani Group?

Hindenburg Research’s report also alleged that the Adani Group has used offshore shell companies linked to Adani’s family to drive up share prices.

According to a podcast by the Economist, the share price growth of Nifty50 is what attracted Hindenburg to research on India over the last few years. The Adani stock chart was pretty much straight up for the year, and it’s an overvalued stock, it said.

Hindenburg believes that the Adani Group has “substantial debt” and that the stock prices of the listed companies are overvalued by 85%.

However, the US-based firm has revealed little about the size of its bets and the kind of derivatives and reference securities it used in this case, Reuters reported.

The short seller said it held its position “through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivatives, along with other non-Indian-traded reference securities.”

“I wanted to short it myself, but I was not able to find a way to do it with my prime broker,” Citron Research founder Andrew Left, referring to Adani Enterprises and other companies, told Reuters.

Hindenburg also declined to comment to Reuters on the method it used to place its bets against Adani.

Can Hindenburg be held accountable for not disclosing its bets?

According to Shah, “our financial activities should be well shrouded in privacy. You or I should not have to disclose our speculative bets. Our financial activities should be as secret as our health records.”

He added that if short selling were to be introduced in India, there needs to be no disclosure going with it. “At a conceptual level, you borrow shares from me and sell them on the market. Your selling on the market is already protected by privacy. Why should your borrowing from me not be equally protected?” he said.

He further said that the single secret information on the NSE is the name of the participant who is doing the trading. “Everything else about the market – the price of a security, the orders present about the security, etc. – are freely released into the public domain.

In the historical context, what were SEBI’s views on ‘short selling’?

In a 2005 discussion paper on this subject, the Securities and Exchange Board of India had noted that “the votaries of short selling consider it as a desirable and an essential feature of a securities market. The critics of short selling, on the other hand, are convinced that short selling, directly or indirectly, poses potential risks and can easily destabilise the market.”

“In their view, the restrictions on short selling distort efficient price discovery, ‘gives promoters the unfettered freedom to manipulate prices, and favours manipulators than rational investors,” the paper had said.

This paper led to the opening up of ‘short selling’ to more market participants in 2007.

In December 2007, SEBI allowed all classes of investors to short sell, after recommendations by the Secondary Market Advisory Committee, which provides suggestions to SEBI to improve market safety, efficiency and transparency.

The 2005 paper had said, “It is noteworthy though, that despite the conflicting schools of thought, securities market regulators in most countries and in particular, in all developed securities markets, recognise short selling as a legitimate investment activity. Such jurisdictions also have an active market for equity derivatives which includes stock futures. Some of the jurisdictions even recognise the usefulness of naked short sales in certain circumstances and instead of prohibiting short sales; the regulators have permitted it to take place within a regulated framework.”

Harassment of short sellers

Exposing fraud is in the public interest, The Conversation said, adding that “if the report is truthful, blaming Hindenburg for Adani’s crash is like blaming an alarm for a fire.”

In fact, fundamental short selling can be a valuable indicator of fraud and misrepresentation, fund manager, Fahmi Quadir at Safkhet Capital, notable for her forensic research on companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals and the Germany company Wirecard, had said.

The regulator had focused on probing so-called short-sellers and journalists behind reports which questioned Wirecard’s accounts, halting short-selling in the stock, rather than immediately investigating the company. Wirecard eventually went bust.

“The release of this information [related to fraud and misconduct] ultimately benefits shareholders who deserve the opportunity to assess a company’s true value without disruptive regulatory overreach. The simultaneous actions taken to investigate mainstream, credible news agencies reporting on Wirecard may prevent additional whistleblowers from coming forward with price-critical information,” Quadir had said.

The Economist in the podcast noted that short sellers conduct very thorough research on the company before publishing the report. The reactions of the market and of the company, however, tell to what extent the report was true.

Adani Group called the report “malicious”, “baseless” and a “calculated attack on India”. Several people, including Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, allegedly used Twitter to spread misinformation against the short seller.

Instead of scrutinising the allegations against the group, whose rapid growth, that too in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political career, had raised concerns, several people made it a “nationalist issue”, including Adani himself.

However, as mentioned earlier, SEBI has said that it will conduct a detailed examination into the companies’ stocks.

In a separate case in 2019, the Delhi high court had called out the threatening tactics used by Indiabulls against a short-focussed researcher.

In August 2012, Veritas Investment, a Canadian company, had published a research report on Indiabulls, titled Bilking India. The report alleged corporate governance issues against the company. It was published based on the public filings of Indiabulls Financial Services, Indiabulls Real Estate and other group firms, Business Standard had reported.

Indiabulls responded with a criminal complaint against the two authors of the report, and even got one of them arrested.

The Delhi high court had in 2019 called out Indiabulls for “harassment” of equity analysts, the Economic Times had reported. It had said: “Such litigation could also result in genuine researchers being dissuaded from writing articles which would not be in the interest of the investing public.”

If short selling is a legitimate activity in the markets, then why is it seen in such a negative light?

In India, most of the trading in equity futures and options is settled in cash. The settlement happens after the expiry of a contract. This is when the buyer and the seller have to fulfil their obligations. And since it’s a speculative activity, it’s not seen in a positive light.

Sanjiv Shah, mutual fund industry veteran and co-founder of Benchmark Asset Management, told The Wire over the phone, “It’s more like a human psychology. People profiting from selling and price reducing rather than making money from price increases –that’s a human psychology more than anything else.”

Abhishek Mundra, a stock market analyst, full-time trader and investor, told The Wire on LinkedIn: “This is because everyone is taught to look at the markets rising to higher levels on hope. Most of the participants don’t know how to sell high first, and buy low later. [It’s] just the systematic thinking since early ages.”

The Indian market, according to an Economic Times report, is considered to be one of the most speculative in the world as far as derivatives contracts go. Dalal Street has a high derivative to cash turnover ratio.

In 2020, Bloomberg reported that the NSE surpassed America’s CME Group Inc. to become the world’s largest derivatives bourse by volume. NSE traded the most contracts in the world in 2019, the report said.

As of February 15, 2023, the derivatives to cash ratio is 2.9 on the NSE. Basically, it’s three times more. Sanjiv Shah explains: “for example, if Rs 100 worth of stock has been traded in the underlying [asset], which is, Rs 100 worth of shares have been transferred in the cash segment. So, [suppose] everybody put together a Rs 100 in the [cash] market. The same activity in the derivatives – the futures and options market – is Rs 300.”

In 2018, the derivatives to cash market ratio for India had increased to 29.6.

Meanwhile, in the wake of the recent onslaught in the trading sessions last month, SEBI has said it will ascertain the role of short sellers in bringing the market down.

It’s important to note that India has limited options for short selling. According to Mint, it is difficult to short sell a stock that’s not in the F&O system. There is a securities lending and borrowing or SLB system on paper.

However, most shorting happens through derivatives (futures and options) rather than the SLB mechanism. “This is because the SLB mechanism has high interest rates of 1-1.5% per month and very low liquidity. There are also additional frictions and paperwork involved in SLB,” Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha and True Beacon, an alternative asset manager, told the business daily.

In futures, he added, that there’s only a roll-over cost, which is much less as compared to SLB. “But naturally, this restricts shorting to the stocks in F&O,” he told the newspaper.

Sanjiv Shah further explained, “Basically, I will borrow the stock, sell in the market, hoping that one or two months later, I will be able to buy it back when the price falls. But FIIs cannot do that. So, they go short on the futures market.”

What are the advantages of ‘short selling’, especially for retail investors in India?

“Retail investors are protected when the big boys will spot problems in stock prices and use short selling to bring about a correction,” Ajay Shah said.

“For the top 50 to 100 stocks, where derivatives trading is available, de facto this is now being done using the derivatives. But for the remaining securities, this is currently not being done. This is where short selling mechanisms (i.e., securities lending mechanisms) will help.”

“I do not recommend that retail investors engage in short selling, or in active financial markets trading. They are better off being long-term investors using index funds,” he added.","Since then, several questions have been raised on short selling – if it’s ethical, how it’s done, is it legal in India, etc.

Data from the social media analytics platform Social Blade shows that the follower count of Hindenburg Research jumped by nearly 2.5 lakh in the last one month with the total count now pegged at nearly 4.5 lakh.

Interestingly, the research firm joined Twitter in July 2017 but there was not much of traction in terms of following as the official handle of the research firm that takes short positions in firms before releasing a report typically gained an insignificant number of followers every month.

The trend registered a huge spike in January with nearly 2 lakh new followers – it had gained a paltry 193 new followers in December 2022.

The activity level also shot up post the release of the report on the Adani Group – which led to the group’s market capitalisation eroding by over $100 billion in a matter of days – as the Twitter handle posted extracts from its report quite frequently – often more than a few times every day.

While there were many tweets – all related to its report on Adani Group -- posted on January 25, the last tweet prior to those were posted on January 9 that was followed by tweets on December 7, 2022.

Similarly, the follower count of Anderson whose Twitter handle is @ClarityToast, also jumped by more than 17,000 in the last one month, with the total follower count pegged at nearly 44,000.

While Anderson calls his Twitter handle a “personal account”, all his tweets are related to reports of Hindenburg. Further, the jump in his follower count has mirrored the trend of Hindenburg's handle with January seeing the count at nearly 7,000 even as December saw his follower count move up by only 430.

Post the release of the report on Adani Group, Anderson has mostly tweeted/retweeted media reports that support the findings of Hindenburg.

Meanwhile, going by the publicly-available data on its site, the research firm that claims to unearth “man-made disasters floating around in the market” has released reports on more than 15 companies till date starting in 2017.

While Indian business conglomerate Adani Group is its latest target, the firm was most active in the year 2020 even as there was a global lockdown on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The research firm earlier released scathing reports on companies like Nikola, WINS Finance, China Metal Resources Utilization, SC Worx, Predictive Technology Group, SmileDirectClub, and Yangtze River Port & Logistics among others.

More importantly, the research firm always takes a short position – designed to profit from a fall in the stock price -- in the company before releasing a report.

The Wire,2023-03-02 14:35:25.338116,Should Bangladesh Get Out of the Adani Power Deal?,https://thewire.in/south-asia/bangladesh-adani-power-deal-energy,"As billionaire Gautam Adani's business empire and its practices have become a subject ... power purchase deal with Adani Power (Jharkhand) Limited (APJL),...",None,Should Bangladesh Get Out of the Adani Power Deal?,"As billionaire Gautam Adani’s business empire and its practices have become a subject of intense global scrutiny, Bangladesh, too, seems to be drawn under the scanner.

More and more experts are now coming out questioning the rationale behind Bangladesh’s power purchase deal with Adani Power (Jharkhand) Limited (APJL), which many of them have termed as “one-sided” and against Bangladesh’s interests. Amid such controversy, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, adviser to the prime minister on energy, while responding to questions from the Indian media recently, said talks with the Adani Group on power supply were “private” and “can’t be made public.”

It’s unclear whether the prime minister’s energy adviser meant commercial secrecy of the deal or the political compulsion alleged by The Washington Post in a report on December 9, 2022.

The question of commercial secrecy is no longer a valid argument, since a number of news organisations have obtained a copy of the contract and experts have published detailed analysis of it. Reviewing the Adani contract, The Washington Post suggested that though the deal appeared unfavourable, not signing it was not an option for political reasons.

Surprisingly, the Bangladesh government did not respond to the newspaper’s request for comments or protest its suggestions after the story was published. This policy of secrecy seems to be maintained strictly, as the government refrains from contesting the claims in the local press that the APJL will be paid almost double the purchase price of power compared to that paid to Bangladeshi producers, and three times the price of power imported from other sources in India at present.

These price comparisons are crucial as the import of Adani power is in addition to the existing overcapacity.

Last week, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in his speech in Lok Sabha, made similar suggestions when he questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s deal for selling power to Bangladesh became a deal between Bangladesh and the Adani Group. Rahul Gandhi’s attack on Modi’s relationship with Adani is nothing new.

What’s new, though, is the timing as the Adani Group’s share values and fortune have been bleeding heavily following the allegations of widespread fraud and irregularities by the well-known activist investment firm Hindenburg Research. Hindenburg called it “the largest con in corporate history.”

Before all this media brouhaha, another serious research pointed out the flaw in the contract and put out a figure of more than US $ 1 billion that Adani would be getting from Bangladesh over its 25-year term. In a joint study, published in June 2022, the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BWGED) and Growthwatch, a voluntary research and advocacy institution in India, said the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) would have to pay a maximum of US $ 1.17 billion and a minimum of US $ 918.18 million per year to buy electricity from Adani Group’s Godda Power Plant. Of this amount, US $ 423.29 million is the capacity charge per year, which amounts to US $ 11.01 billion over its lifetime, which will only benefit the billionaire Adani Group to make more money.

Now AdaniWatch, a non-profit project established “to shine a light on the Adani Group’s misdeeds across the planet,” claims that the contract between Bangladesh and Adani may be “legally invalid.”

In a co-authored article, Ravi Nair, an independent Indian journalist, says there are at least two issues that may allow either parties to scrap the deal altogether. According to India’s Guidelines on Cross Border Trade of Electricity, coal-fired power plants owned by private companies would only be allowed to export electricity if they had surplus capacity. AdaniWatch says India still doesn’t have power surplus, and bending the rules by the state of Jharkhand to exempt Adani may not be legal.

Also read: Will the Hindenburg Episode Affect Adani’s – and India’s – Energy Plans?

It then adds that Adani’s inclusion of costs that appear to be non-existent may allow Bangladesh to claim the deal invalid, too. According to the report, under the contract, the BPDB will have to pay a reference tariff that includes excise duty, customs duty for imported goods, service tax, krishi kallyan tax, central sales tax, VAT on equipment, composite tax on civil construction, work contract tax, construction workers’ welfare fees, water charges, and income tax.

But four and a half months before the contract was signed, the Indian government rolled out a comprehensive Goods and Services Tax regime, replacing almost all those state and centre taxes. Then again in 2019, 15 months after signing the contract, the Godda Power Plant project was declared a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), granting them a lot of tax exemptions. Documents showed that the majority of the company’s imports came after the project was declared an SEZ, and the company also avoids paying import duty or any other tax on imported coal. It also doesn’t have to pay GST, surcharges on duties, or any other import duty.

AdaniWatch says the power purchase agreement (PPA) “stipulates that APJL must inform BPDB of any changes in law that might affect these assumptions within 30 days of such an occurrence, and any variation shall be adjusted in the reference capacity price.” Clearly, the PPA was signed without informing the BPDB about the changes that hugely cut APJL’s tax liabilities. AdaniWatch asks whether these changes were notified to the other contracting party, and if it wasn’t, the agreement may be legally voided by the BPDB for breach of contract.

There’s scant public debate in Bangladesh over such a costly blunder, compared to foreign observers and media, despite the fact that it will be the Bangladeshi consumers who will have to carry the burden. Adani Power Ltd, on February 3, 2023, informed the National Stock Exchange of India that its subsidiary APJL had received a request from the BPDB to consider a discount on the energy charge as per the PPA, adding that no PPA amendment was under consideration.

This latest development suggests that the BPDB might do well by demanding scrapping the contract for the deliberate breach by Adani to take undue advantage. Or else questions of political compulsion would prove hard to dispel.

The chief minister said that the Himachal government was committed to protecting the rights of the truck operators of the state, and added that issue would be resolved in a way that both parties should not suffer any losses.

Emphasizing ending the deadlock, CM Sukhu said that both sides should resolve this issue amicably.

Two cement plants at Barmana (Bilaspur district) and Darlaghat (Solan district) owned by ACC Limited and Ambuja Cements, respectively, have been closed since December 14 due to a dispute over freight charges.

There are about 6,500 trucks attached to the two cement plants and the grounding of trucks has hit the livelihood of thousands of families. The only source of income for operators and their staff members has been blocked and they are facing acute financial problems, representatives of truck unions had said earlier.

Ajay Kapur, the CEO of the conglomerate's cement business, had said in a letter to the chairman of the Permanent Standing Committee that the transportation market was completely controlled by the unions, which decide the rates and deployment of trucks.

This forced the company to close operations after the unions adopted an unworkable position on the freight rate and distribution model, he had said.

Representatives of truck unions said they were awaiting the report of the Himachal Consultancy Organisation (HIMCON) following which the rates would be notified by the government. They said they hoped that the rates would be higher than the existing ones.

The management had been asking truck operators to lower the freight rates to ₹6 per tonne per km. However, the truck unions rejected the demand.","Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu chaired a meeting with the stakeholders to end the deadlock between the executives of the Adani Group-owned cement plants in Bilaspur and Solan districts and truck unions over freight rates.

On reasons for being bullish on Adani Wilmar shares, KRChoksey says, ""Adani Wilmar Ltd has reported revenue of ₹1,54,381mn, an increase of 4.3% on a YoY basis and

3.9% on a QoQ basis, with volume growth across all the segments and good progress to gain market share across key product categories. Growth was driven by the extension of distribution networks, an increase in direct reach across urban and rural markets, and excellent execution in alternate channels.""

The brokerage went on to add that alternative channels such as E-commerce, Modern Trade, and eB2B have continued to grow at a much faster rate, owing to a shift in customer behavior. The company recognises a large opportunity in the HoReCa (Hotel, Restaurants, and Caterers) segment and is planning to develop an operating model to drive sales in this segment.

On valuations, the brokerage said, ""Adani Wilmar has shown strong volume growth in Food and FMCG and Industry Essentials with market share gains in Edible oil, Atta and Rice. The share price has been declining due to various news and reports about the Adani Group; however, we believe that this is temporary and the company will perform well because of the company’s strong and sustainable volume growth. AWL’s focus on penetration-led growth and increasing its reach is yielding results for the company.""

On suggestion to positional investors looking for discounted shopping, KRChoksey said, ""We like the company’s strategy of penetration led growth, focus on the international market, increasing distribution reach, timely capacity addition to supporting the growth, new product launches, and acquisition of the Kohinoor brand. We expect Adani Wilmar to benefit from the recent uptick in demand. Currently, the stock is trading at a PE multiple of 64.8x/41.9x/34.6x based on our FY23E / FY24E / FY25E EPS estimates, respectively.

Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi on Monday mounted a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly favouring the Adani Group and sought to know why his speech on the ‘nexus between the two’ was edited out of Parliament records.

Addressing party workers at Meenangadi in Wayanad on Monday, Mr. Gandhi alleged the nexus between the Prime Minister and Gautam Adani made the latter the second richest person in the world.

Queries to Mr. Modi

Mr. Gandhi said he had raised many questions to Mr. Modi in Parliament regarding his ‘links with Mr. Adani.’ “Some of the questions were: How many times did Mr. Adani travel to a country immediately after the Prime Minister’s visit to the country? How many times did Mr. Adani get a contract in a foreign country after the Prime Minister’s visit? How did Mr. Adani grow so fast? But Mr. Modi failed to respond to the questions. Instead he asked, ‘Why are you not called Nehru? Why are you called Gandhi?,’” said Mr. Gandhi. In response to Mr. Modi’s query on his surname, he said, “In India, generally, our surname is the surname of our father,” he said.

The MP said shell companies abroad were sending thousands of crores of rupees to India. “Nobody knows where they are based and who owns the companies,” he added.

On farmers’ plight

Mr. Gandhi said that during his ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ he had met people from various walks of life, including farmers. The condition of farmers in all the States was sad and pathetic. “Their plight should change, for which the Union government and the State governments should adopt immediate steps. The concerns of those struggling on land for their livelihood should be addressed,” he said.

Mr. Gandhi said he would bring his mother and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi next time to Wayanad. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran presided.

Prior to the meeting, Mr. Gandhi visited the family of Viswanathan, a tribal youth of Adled hamlet here, who was found hanging near the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. He also interacted with the relatives of Thomas Pallippurath, of Puthussery, who was recently killed in a tiger attack.

He attended the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee meeting and the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) review meeting.","How many times did Mr. Adani get a contract in a foreign country after the Prime Minister’s visit?
How did Mr. Adani grow so fast?

With Adani Group shares correcting due to the allegations made in the Hindenburg report, the gap between Gautam Adani and Reliance Industries (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani -- two of India's richest individuals -- is widening.

Mukesh Ambani is on the 11th spot in the global rich list and has a net worth of $83.6 billion as per the Bloomberg Billionaires’ Index. According to the Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires’ List, however, Ambani is on the 8th spot and has a net worth of $86 billion.

The Hindenburg Research report that jolted the Adani Group’s fortunes and future plans came just before Adani Enterprises’ Rs 20,000 crore follow-on-public offer (FPO) opened. The Hindenburg report accused the Adani Group of accounting fraud and stock manipulation. The group has lost around $125 billion in market value in three weeks since the report came out.

The Adani Group has denied Hindenburg’s allegations as being “malicious”, “baseless”, and a “calculated attack on India.”

Meanwhile, DLF chairman KP Singh said claims about the Hindenburg report on Adani Group impacting India’s potential as an investment destination are completely nonsensical. Singh said, “India is too big a country today. So, this story will die down. Investment will not be hurt.”

The SC had earlier suggested an expert committee to review and improve the current framework for investor protection and the Centre had proposed to set up a panel and submit its suggestions in a sealed envelope.

“We must not accept a sealed cover suggestions from the government. We want to ensure full transparency. It (accepting sealed cover) may give the impression that it is a government-appointed committee that has been accepted by the SC. We will appoint a committee of our own, will instill confidence,” the court said.

The government’s suggestions should be disclosed to the other side, the bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud stressed, adding that if it does not want to disclose, then it should trust us to form our own committee.

The petitioner Jaya Thakur sought a court-monitored probe into the massive market manipulation and accounting fraud by Adani Group companies.

Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after the Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including those of fraudulent transactions and share price manipulation, against the business conglomerate. The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Thakur said the role of leading public sector banks should also be probed. She also sought a probe into role of LIC, which has an exposure of Rs 30,000 crore in Adani companies. ""Need to probe if LIC was used for warehousing operations for price manipulation of Adani shares,"" she said, adding, ""People in expert panel should be persons who command public confidence.""

Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan appearing for the petitioner said there was no doubt that Sebi had received complaints but “did nothing when share prices climbed 40-50%”.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta reiterated the government's concerns over ""potentially adverse signals being sent to global investors"".

""This is what we had expressed concern about. The government's stance is that all regulators including Sebi had discharged their roles diligently.

The apex court stated that “true facts” should come out from the expert panel without impacting stock markets. The advice to form the committee came from two PILs that were filed in the Supreme Court in the Adani-Hindenburg case.

“If you're not intending us to disclose the names then trust us to appoint our own independent persons,” said the Chief Justice.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Friday submitted the remit to the bench headed by the CJI.

On Monday, Mehta had stressed that the remit of the committee should be very relevant because any unintentional message to the international investors and domestic investors that even a regulator or statutory monitoring authority also needs a monitoring by a committee appointed by the Supreme Court may have some adverse impact on the flow of money.

He had sought that the court could permit the government to suggest the remit of that committee with possible suggestions of names of the committee in a sealed cover, as it may not be appropriate to discuss in open court hearing.

The court was hearing two PILs, one of which sought a direction to the Centre to constitute a committee monitored by a retired apex court judge to inquire into the Hindenburg Research report, while the other one sought prosecution of short-seller Nathan Anderson of Hindenburg Research and his associates in India and the US for allegedly exploiting innocent investors and the ""artificial crashing"" of the Adani Group's stock value in the market.

The release of short-seller Hindenburg Research’s 24 January report accusing the Gautam Adani- led conglomerate of corporate malfeasance sparked a crash in shares of Adani Group companies and created a political furore over the billionaire’s alleged proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Adani Group has dismissed all allegations as baseless and discredited.

After hearing four public interest litigations (PILs) seeking a probe against Hindenburg for causing significant loss to investors, on regulatory lapses, and an investigation of the Adani Group on the basis of the Hindenburg report, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud reserved orders on the remit and composition of the committee.

After examining a note submitted by solicitor general Tushar Mehta in a sealed cover, the bench, also comprising justices P.S. Narasimha and J.B. Pardiwala said, “If we have to accept these suggestions, we must disclose it to the other side. There has to be transparency and confidence in the process.""

The government proposed a six-member committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge, comprising the Union home secretary and director, Enforcement Directorate. The note required the committee to submit a report in eight weeks with the initial report to be filed in sealed cover considering the “volatile and emotion driven"" nature of the securities market. However, the government’s note clarified that the constitution of the committee would not be a reflection on the ability or competence of the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) or any other statutory body.

The bench said, “If it is in a sealed cover, the petitioners will not know which names we accepted and which we have not and they will get to say it is a government-appointed committee."" Following a course of action that it adopted in the past of choosing a committee of its own to examine the Pegasus spyware row where the phones of prominent individuals were allegedly placed under surveillance, the bench said, “We’d rather not accept the sealed cover suggestions in constituting a committee, as we want to follow full transparency. We will appoint a committee in which there will be more confidence."" The court did not wish to put those names in public domain either: “It will not be good for the individuals. We will do it on our own.""

The Centre’s note also dealt with the proposed terms of reference for the committee with the primary task being “to ascertain the truthfulness of allegations against the Adani Group of companies in the Hindenburg report."" The probe, the note added, would also focus on Hindenburg’s admission of acquiring a “short position"" in Adani group debt and derivatives, gathering details of all its transactions undertaken prior to publication of report, and assessing whether the transactions fall foul of the penal, statutory and regulatory framework in India.

The remit of the committee, the note said, would also include suggestions to strengthen the regulatory framework for better protection of investors in future. In addition, the note suggested examination of all short-selling in Adani Group shares “prior to and in near proximity of the Hindenburg report"".

The court also disagreed with Mehta’s submission that there was no larger market impact of the report.

“You have said in your submissions that the market impact was zero. There cannot be denial of the fact that investors have lost money worth lakhs of crores of rupees.""

To be sure, given the low public float of the stock of Adani companies, much of the loss was in the notional wealth of the promoters.

Advocate M.L. Sharma, who was the first to file a PIL, sought an investigation against Hindenburg for a “conspiracy"" to inflict loss on the market and the economy and blamed Sebi for failing to protect investors.

Another petitioner Vishal Tiwari said his prime concern was to protect investors while seeking a court-monitored probe into the revelations made in the Hindenburg report. The other two petitions by Congress leader Jaya Thakur and law student Anamika Jaiswal sought probes against the Adani Group on allegations in the report.

The bench said, “Your prayer presumes guilt. Proper investigation is what you are seeking. We will close it for orders.""

The solicitor general suggested having statutory investigating agencies and Sebi as part of the committee.

Advocate Prashant Bhushan representing Jaiswal, said, “What is the point of having those people against whom there are allegations."" The court remarked: “We cannot start with the presumption of lapse of regulatory framework.""","The Adani Group has dismissed all allegations as baseless and discredited.

Meanwhile, DLF chairman KP Singh said claims about the Hindenburg report on Adani Group impacting India’s potential as an investment destination are completely nonsensical. Singh said, “India is too big a country today. So, this story will die down. Investment will not be hurt.”

The SC had earlier suggested an expert committee to review and improve the current framework for investor protection and the Centre had proposed to set up a panel and submit its suggestions in a sealed envelope.

“We must not accept a sealed cover suggestions from the government. We want to ensure full transparency. It (accepting sealed cover) may give the impression that it is a government-appointed committee that has been accepted by the SC. We will appoint a committee of our own, will instill confidence,” the court said.

The government’s suggestions should be disclosed to the other side, the bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud stressed, adding that if it does not want to disclose, then it should trust us to form our own committee.

The petitioner Jaya Thakur sought a court-monitored probe into the massive market manipulation and accounting fraud by Adani Group companies.

Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after the Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including those of fraudulent transactions and share price manipulation, against the business conglomerate. The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Thakur said the role of leading public sector banks should also be probed. She also sought a probe into role of LIC, which has an exposure of Rs 30,000 crore in Adani companies. ""Need to probe if LIC was used for warehousing operations for price manipulation of Adani shares,"" she said, adding, ""People in expert panel should be persons who command public confidence.""

Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan appearing for the petitioner said there was no doubt that Sebi had received complaints but “did nothing when share prices climbed 40-50%”.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta reiterated the government's concerns over ""potentially adverse signals being sent to global investors"".

""This is what we had expressed concern about. The government's stance is that all regulators including Sebi had discharged their roles diligently.

The Supreme Court had suggested an expert committee to review and improve the current framework for investor protection. The court had earlier expressed concern about ""lakhs of crores"" of investor wealth being wiped out due to a fall in share prices of Adani group companies.

The apex court stated that “true facts” should come out from the expert panel without impacting stock markets. The advice to form the committee came from two PILs that were filed in the Supreme Court in the Adani-Hindenburg case.

""We don't want sealed cover suggestions. Even if we don't accept your suggestions, the other side will have the impression that we accepted the government-adopted committee.

“If you're not intending us to disclose the names then trust us to appoint our own independent persons,” said the Chief Justice.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Friday submitted the remit to the bench headed by the CJI.

On Monday, Mehta had stressed that the remit of the committee should be very relevant because any unintentional message to the international investors and domestic investors that even a regulator or statutory monitoring authority also needs a monitoring by a committee appointed by the Supreme Court may have some adverse impact on the flow of money.

He had sought that the court could permit the government to suggest the remit of that committee with possible suggestions of names of the committee in a sealed cover, as it may not be appropriate to discuss in open court hearing.

The court was hearing two PILs, one of which sought a direction to the Centre to constitute a committee monitored by a retired apex court judge to inquire into the Hindenburg Research report, while the other one sought prosecution of short-seller Nathan Anderson of Hindenburg Research and his associates in India and the US for allegedly exploiting innocent investors and the ""artificial crashing"" of the Adani Group's stock value in the market.

The release of short-seller Hindenburg Research’s 24 January report accusing the Gautam Adani- led conglomerate of corporate malfeasance sparked a crash in shares of Adani Group companies and created a political furore over the billionaire’s alleged proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Adani Group has dismissed all allegations as baseless and discredited.

After hearing four public interest litigations (PILs) seeking a probe against Hindenburg for causing significant loss to investors, on regulatory lapses, and an investigation of the Adani Group on the basis of the Hindenburg report, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud reserved orders on the remit and composition of the committee.

After examining a note submitted by solicitor general Tushar Mehta in a sealed cover, the bench, also comprising justices P.S. Narasimha and J.B. Pardiwala said, “If we have to accept these suggestions, we must disclose it to the other side. There has to be transparency and confidence in the process.""

The government proposed a six-member committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge, comprising the Union home secretary and director, Enforcement Directorate. The note required the committee to submit a report in eight weeks with the initial report to be filed in sealed cover considering the “volatile and emotion driven"" nature of the securities market. However, the government’s note clarified that the constitution of the committee would not be a reflection on the ability or competence of the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) or any other statutory body.

The bench said, “If it is in a sealed cover, the petitioners will not know which names we accepted and which we have not and they will get to say it is a government-appointed committee."" Following a course of action that it adopted in the past of choosing a committee of its own to examine the Pegasus spyware row where the phones of prominent individuals were allegedly placed under surveillance, the bench said, “We’d rather not accept the sealed cover suggestions in constituting a committee, as we want to follow full transparency. We will appoint a committee in which there will be more confidence."" The court did not wish to put those names in public domain either: “It will not be good for the individuals. We will do it on our own.""

The Centre’s note also dealt with the proposed terms of reference for the committee with the primary task being “to ascertain the truthfulness of allegations against the Adani Group of companies in the Hindenburg report."" The probe, the note added, would also focus on Hindenburg’s admission of acquiring a “short position"" in Adani group debt and derivatives, gathering details of all its transactions undertaken prior to publication of report, and assessing whether the transactions fall foul of the penal, statutory and regulatory framework in India.

The remit of the committee, the note said, would also include suggestions to strengthen the regulatory framework for better protection of investors in future. In addition, the note suggested examination of all short-selling in Adani Group shares “prior to and in near proximity of the Hindenburg report"".

The court also disagreed with Mehta’s submission that there was no larger market impact of the report.

“You have said in your submissions that the market impact was zero. There cannot be denial of the fact that investors have lost money worth lakhs of crores of rupees.""

To be sure, given the low public float of the stock of Adani companies, much of the loss was in the notional wealth of the promoters.

Advocate M.L. Sharma, who was the first to file a PIL, sought an investigation against Hindenburg for a “conspiracy"" to inflict loss on the market and the economy and blamed Sebi for failing to protect investors.

Another petitioner Vishal Tiwari said his prime concern was to protect investors while seeking a court-monitored probe into the revelations made in the Hindenburg report. The other two petitions by Congress leader Jaya Thakur and law student Anamika Jaiswal sought probes against the Adani Group on allegations in the report.

The bench said, “Your prayer presumes guilt. Proper investigation is what you are seeking. We will close it for orders.""

The solicitor general suggested having statutory investigating agencies and Sebi as part of the committee.

Advocate Prashant Bhushan representing Jaiswal, said, “What is the point of having those people against whom there are allegations."" The court remarked: “We cannot start with the presumption of lapse of regulatory framework.""","The Adani Group has dismissed all allegations as baseless and discredited.

India slammed billionaire investor George Soros after he alleged the Adani turmoil will weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modi's grip on power and lead to a ""democratic revival"" in the country.

The latest dispute highlights renewed scrutiny on the relationship between India's leader and business tycoon Gautam Adani, who has lost billions in net worth since a short seller report accused his companies of fraud. The Adani Group has denied those allegations, calling the report a ""calculated attack on India.""

Last week, Soros criticized the prime minister saying India was a democracy but Modi ""is no democrat."" Over the weekend, India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, told a conference in Sydney that Soros' comments were typical of a ""Euro-Atlantic view"" and rejected his accusations.

""There are still people in the world who believe that their definition, their preferences, their views must override everything else,"" Jaishankar said.

He added there was ""a debate and conversation that we must have on democracy,"" including whose values defined a democracy as the world rebalanced and became less Euro-Atlantic.

""He is old, rich, opinionated and dangerous, because what happens is, when such people and such views and such organizations — they actually invest resources in shaping narratives"" Jaishankar said in a response to a question about the billionaire's remarks.

India's voters will decide ""how the country should [be] run,"" the foreign minister said.

NTPC, NHPC, Power Grid and PFC are reportedly looking to sell their stakes in PTC

Adani Power's planned Rs 7,017-cr acquisition of coal-based electricity generating units of DB Power Ltd fell through recently

Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani has decided against bidding for a stake in state-backed energy trading firm Power Trading Corporation, said a report on Monday.

Amid the massive fallout from US short seller Hindenburg Research's scathing report, the conglomerate is looking to preserve cash, reported Bloomberg.

State-owned entities NTPC Ltd, NHPC Ltd, Power Grid Corp of India Ltd and Power Finance Corp Ltd are working with an adviser to weigh selling their stakes of around 4% each, with bids due as soon as the end of the month, Bloomberg reported last month.

PTC India, which also counts Life Insurance Corp of India and Damodar Valley Corp among its shareholders, has a market capitalisation of nearly Rs 2,500 crore. A 16% stake in PTC India could be valued at Rs 415 crore, according to latest prices.

The report comes days after Adani Power's planned Rs 7,017-crore acquisition of coal-based electricity generating units of DB Power Ltd has fallen as the deadline to complete the transaction expired without signing of the pact.

In its January report, Hindenburg alleged accounting fraud and stock manipulation, allegations that the group has vehemently denied.

The report, which flagged high debt including pledging shares of inflated stock for loans, put the entire group on precarious financial footing.

Since the January 24 report, the group companies have seen half of their market value wiped out and the conglomerate having to pledge more shares to meet lending norms. It also called off a follow-on share sale at its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises Ltd that barely scraped through on the last day of the sale.

The acquisition of DB Power, which currently operates a 2x600 MW coal-fired power plant in Janjgir Champa district in Chhattisgarh, was expected to expand Adani Power's offerings and operations in the thermal power sector in the state.

DB Power has long and medium-term power purchase agreements for 923.5 MW of its capacity, backed by fuel supply agreements with Coal India Ltd. It had recorded a turnover of Rs 3,488 crore for the financial year 2022.

By: Ashish Rukhaiyar and Krishna Gopalan

Gautam adani, 60, is like the proverbial cat with nine lives. The highly controversial school dropout-turned-global business tycoon has faced countless challenges in his lifetime, even death, and only emerged stronger. In 2008, the Adani Group Chairman and Founder survived the 26/11 terrorist attack at Mumbai’s Taj Mahal hotel, where he was dining when the attackers struck. A decade prior, on New Year’s Day of 1998, Adani was kidnapped by two gangsters in Ahmedabad, and was held to ransom. Whether he paid the ransom or not is not known. Neither is it consequential. What’s important is: he survived. Both times. Will he survive Hindenburg? There is no evidence to suggest anything to the contrary, at least not yet, albeit the Adani empire has shrunk dramatically since the US-based short-selling research firm’s allegations of accounting fraud, stock manipulation and routing of funds through overseas shell companies were revealed in its report on January 24 (see chart ‘Hindenburg Alleges…’). Despite a 413-page rebuttal to the charges, which Hindenburg dismissed as inconsequential, Adani’s listed firms were battered by the markets, recovering now and then only to plunge further on more bad news. All through this mayhem, the burly billionaire has maintained a stoic posture, once in a while floating a confidence-building measure here, and another there (see chart ‘Confidence-Building Measures’). On January 27, three days after the Hindenburg assault, the Rs 2.4-lakh crore Adani Group’s mothership, Adani Enterprises, opened its much-anticipated Rs 20,000-crore follow-on public offering (FPO). But with the circumstances having changed, the management deliberated on whether to look at overseas markets to raise money, shelve the issue altogether, or lower the offer price. In the end, Adani and his ‘A’ team stuck to their guns and went ahead as originally planned. After much huffing and puffing, the FPO scraped through on the last day, January 31, with a subscription of 1.12 times, thanks to sustained bidding by institutions, family offices and high net-worth individuals.

The key for the group is to strengthen the balance sheet and probably cut down on the number of projects in order to reduce the debt. So, now is not the time to raise debt but [to] reduce it Mark Mobius

Mobius Capital Partners LLP

The same day, even as Adani Enterprises’ FPO hobbled past the finish line, Gautam Adani was pictured in Israel with its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, smiling assuredly as his Indian conglomerate acquired Israel’s key Haifa port for $1.2 billion. Adani was trying to send a signal to the markets—this was just another day at the office; he was on top of the situation. After all, his group spans key infrastructure segments like airports, ports, roads, power and cement, among other things, which have physical assets generating enough cash to stave off any worries. Under normal circumstances. But circumstances were not normal and, clearly, Adani’s signals were not having their desired effect. On February 1, global banks like Credit Suisse, Citi and Standard Chartered stopped accepting Adani’s bonds and securities as collateral, resulting in a hammering of group stocks. The same day, the group called off the FPO. Shares of Adani Enterprises, which had touched a high of Rs 4,189 in December 2022, plunged to a 52-week low of Rs 1,017 on February 3 (both intra-day trading figures). Since January 24, when the Hindenburg report became public, shares of Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission more than halved in a matter of days, wiping off over $100 billion in market capitalisation in the biggest stock rout Indian markets have seen, though the losses have been partially recouped.

“I am not surprised, since the Adani Group is heavily leveraged and the high debt is a cause for concern,” says Mark Mobius, the widely followed global investor and Founder of Mobius Capital Partners LLP. So much so that capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also got into action. “Sebi is already enquiring into both the allegations made in the Hindenburg report as well as the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report, to identify violations of Sebi regulations...,” the regulator told the Supreme Court on February 13. Questions now swirl around how the group would manage to salvage its reputation and service its staggering gross debt of Rs 2.25 lakh crore. For Adani, who is used to lenders chasing him to fund his various projects, the changed circumstances are bound to pose serious challenges. How will Adani, a man perceived to be close to the ruling political dispensation, recover from this crisis? There is a lot at stake for his investors, joint venture partners, lenders and the family of shareholders. The coming weeks and months are expected to see the Adani story continue to play out as the embattled billionaire—who has dropped out of the global top 20 billionaires’ list (he was at No. 24 as of February 14)—struggles to keep his empire and investment plans, earlier estimated at $107 billion over 9-10 years, on course. The question, then, is: where does the Adani Group go from here? The key for the group is to strengthen the balance sheet and probably cut down on the number of projects... now is not the time to raise debt but to reduce it,” says Mobius, who generally advises investors to avoid heavily leveraged companies in a rising interest rate environment globally.

“A valuation of Adani Enterprises with upbeat assumptions on revenue growth and operating margins... without factoring [in] the Hindenburg accusations... yields a value of about Rs 945 per share” Aswath Damodaran

The other major issue is the limited retail holding in Adani Group stocks—the promoters hold anywhere between 57 per cent (in the recently acquired ACC) and 88 per cent (in FMCG major Adani Wilmar)—which Adani tried to partially correct through the FPO of Adani Enterprises. “They wanted to increase the public float. That made sense, but the Hindenburg report was totally unexpected,” says a banker familiar with the group. Another corporate banker who has lent to the group says equity valuation has little meaning. “We have never lent against equity. The Adani Group went for leveraged growth, which was at a time when debt was easily available. In the new scenario now, expansion will be difficult,” he says. The view on the street is that until a strategic investor puts in cash in one of the operating firms, raising money would be a challenge. “That will entail a process of due diligence and can address some of the issues raised by Hindenburg,” says a banker. The conglomerate could still look at foreign banks, even as domestic lenders including State Bank of India have come under scrutiny over their exposure to the group. In fact, the bulk of the group’s incremental funding for new businesses and acquisitions in recent years has come through overseas sources like foreign banks and bonds. Large acquisitions, such as cement, have been fully funded by foreign banks, stated a report by financial services firm CLSA.

Going ahead, while the Adani Group is among the Top 3 across the businesses it operates in—ports, airports, power, cements, solar panels, etc.—it would still need funds for expansion such as in Adani Ports, where 100 million metric tonnes capacity will be added, or the massive expansion for airports including the new one in Navi Mumbai, or to fund more buyouts in the cement sector. Undoubtedly, the terms of lending would be different now. “For any corporate, the credit line is its lifeblood. Any hindrance to that will have a cascading effect and at this point, it is an area of concern,” says Mahesh Singhi, Founder & MD of Singhi Advisors, an M&A advisory firm. Creditors and other bond holders, he says, need to take a long-term approach to the Adani Group businesses from now on. “That’s what they did when they lent money. Nothing should change when it comes to that. Adani is certainly not a Satyam and all its businesses are fundamentally well-placed.” Singhi says the assets are as hard and real as the liabilities are. Indeed, the group’s assets are valued higher than even its astronomical debt. The total debt of the group’s seven listed entities—Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports & SEZ, Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, Adani Transmission, Adani Wilmar and Adani Total Gas—was pegged at around Rs 2.25 lakh crore at the end of FY22. Total assets, on the other hand, were valued at Rs 4.1 lakh crore, per data from corporate database ACE Equity. Further, the cumulative net profit of the seven companies in FY22 was nearly Rs 13,200 crore, with none in the red. Add recent acquisitions ACC, Ambuja Cements and NDTV to the mix, and the cumulative profit goes up to more than Rs 18,800 crore. There is also the extra cushioning of the seven companies’ total cash reserves of over Rs 30,000 crore. In addition, Vinit Bolinjkar, Head (Research) at Ventura Securities, points out that at the group level, the Ebitda generated is around Rs 50,000 crore per year. “They could pull back on their investments in hydrogen or reduce the planned capacity in green energy. That will help reduce the debt levels,” he says, adding that on the debt burden, the domestic piece is well backed by assets and healthy cash flows from its businesses. “In the international markets, the bonds have back-ended payments and there is no serious cause for concern. Their approach has been about projects with scale and a dominant market share. Now, that needs to be fine-tuned in a few places.” Bolinjkar explains that projects like green energy give not just very high operating margins (in excess of 90 per cent) but also throw up enough cash to service existing debt.

There is not even 1 per cent risk for policyholders [and] shareholders [from LIC’s holdings in the Adani Group]. There will be no impact on the investments... It is just a drop in the ocean M.R. Kumar

Speaking of energy, in yet another setback, European multinational energy major TotalEnergies, which has a stake in Adani Total Gas and Adani Green, has put on hold its hydrogen partnership with the Indian conglomerate, although it said that its $3.1-billion investment in the group is still healthy. “It makes no sense to add more (projects) until there is clarity. Adani has to explain the allegations,” Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of TotalEnergies, said in an earnings call in early February. Incidentally, rating agencies—whose words matter in the bond market—seem to be divided over their outlook on the Adani Group. S&P cut its outlook on two group firms (Adani Ports and Adani Electricity), and Moody’s downgraded its outlook for Adani Green Energy, Adani Green Energy Restricted Group, Adani Transmission Step-One and Adani Electricity Mumbai from stable to negative. On the other hand, Fitch said loans to all Adani Group entities “generally account for 0.8-1.2 per cent of total lending for Fitch-rated Indian banks… Even in a distress scenario, it is unlikely that all of this exposure would be written down, as much of it is tied to performing projects”. Fitch added that Indian banks’ exposure to the group is not enough to present a substantial risk to the banks’ standalone credit profiles. For instance, SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara has publicly said his bank’s exposure of around Rs 27,000 crore was just 0.9 per cent of its total loan book. Despite the pummelling the group has received of late, bankers and analysts continue to express confidence in the high-quality assets owned by the group. Says an infrastructure sector chief executive who sold a key asset to the Adani Group a few years ago: “It’s not as if the assets do not have value. If the valuations have soared to unrealistic levels, it does not take away from the fact that the assets have a lot of intrinsic value.” Take the case of Adani Power, which sits on a capacity of 20 GW. At today’s valuations, a potential buyout can be struck at Rs 5 crore per MW taking the value of the company to Rs 1 lakh crore. Knocking off a debt of Rs40,000 crore in Adani Power’s books, the equity component will still fetch Rs60,000 crore. (Of course, in the case of a distressed asset, the story is quite different. For perspective, this January, Vedanta acquired the debt-ridden Meenakshi Energy’s 1,000-MW plant in Andhra Pradesh for Rs 1,140 crore or Rs 1.14 crore per MW. But Adani’s power plants are not distressed by any stretch.) Using the same logic for the cement businesses, Ambuja and ACC, which Adani acquired from Swiss major Holcim for $10.5 billion, leave behind an equity value of more than Rs 90,000 crore after knocking off their debt of Rs 50 crore.

Adani’s Iceberg By Ashish Rukhaiyar In its own words, Nathan Anderson’s New York-based Hindenburg Research is a firm that specialises in forensic financial research on issues like accounting irregularities, undisclosed related-party transactions, illegal or unethical business or financial reporting practices, and also undisclosed regulatory or financial issues, among others. Noble objectives. But there’s also a slightly different underlying to this descriptor. Hindenburg is a short-seller, which means it could make a profit from its damning reports as well, in addition to exposing chinks in firms’ armour. Adani Group companies’ implosion in the stock markets is the outcome of one such shorting investment by Hindenburg. Going short on a stock is a complex and risky investment manoeuvre designed to generate a profit if the share price of a ‘shorted’ firm falls, especially one that is perceived to be overvalued. How does it work? Shares are borrowed at, say, `X, from a broker and then sold at their current market value (say, `X or `X+10). If the value falls to, say, `X-10, the borrower buys back the shares from the market at `X-10, and returns them to the lender, thereby making a profit. Of course, if the bet fails and the shares climb in value instead of falling, then the borrower makes a loss, which is why this is so risky. Hindenburg took the risk, and its ruse worked, although it is difficult to ascertain the quantum of gains it might have made. Before releasing its report, Hindenburg took short positions on Adani Group firms. (In India, there are many restrictions imposed on short-selling and, hence, Hindenburg took its short positions through Adani’s US-traded bonds and non-India-traded derivative instruments.) Subsequently, the markets got jittery after the report was released, and Adani Group firms lost $100 billion-plus in market capitalisation. Hindenburg has made a habit of the shorting strategy. In 2020, the firm released reports on as many as seven companies after taking short positions on them. Its report on US-based automaker Nikola grabbed headlines in September 2020, scything the stock’s value from $66 in June 2020 to around $2.5 currently. Hindenburg had taken a short position in Nikola before releasing its report. Similarly, the shares of Genuis Brands, the target of a June 2020 report, fell from around $7 to $1.50 with Hindenburg again having a short position. Shares of China Metal Resources Utilization, Predictive Technology Group and HF Foods, among others, all witnessed huge falls in the months following reports by Hindenburg, which had taken short positions in each of the companies. Ostensibly, Anderson and Hindenburg would have made money from these stocks’ crashes. This profit-making objective puts to question the motive of short-sellers such as Hindenburg, albeit the corporate governance aspects of their reports surely can’t be wished away.

The Adani Group did not respond to a detailed questionnaire from Business Today for this story. Much as the robustness of the businesses is acknowledged, but the ability to raise money with ease, as it was earlier, is bound to be hit as lenders turn jittery after the Hindenburg charges. Despite the brave faces, even Indian lenders will need to think hard before cutting big cheques for the group in the near future. As part of his media interactions in January—ahead of the ill-fated FPO—Jugeshinder Singh, Group CFO of the conglomerate, had said that $50 billion was the planned capex for the green hydrogen business alone. Lenders point to the inherent difficulties of this exercise in the domestic and international markets given the current situation. On the face of it, the stakes outside Indian shores are more complicated. After the Credit Suisse and Citi actions, S&P Dow Jones has removed Adani Enterprises from its sustainability indices while Morgan Stanley Capital International has lowered the free float factor of Adani Enterprises, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas and ACC. [MSCI later said that it would postpone the action on Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas till May] Bankers say that in the international market, some investors will hold on to the group’s bonds but the worry is that “investors generally panic”. Besides, they explain, there are “vulture investors” who will come in to push the price down and lead to higher bond yields. “At the crux is to restore confidence to ensure the repricing of bonds takes place. Besides, the vulture funds will be hugely attracted to the yields, which they don’t see in any other part of the world,” says a corporate banker.

Speaking of confidence-building measures—a term used more in diplomacy and military warfare—the group is leaving no stone unturned. On February 6, the group said that the promoters have prepaid $1.1 billion to release share pledges in three group companies—Adani Ports & SEZ, Adani Green and Adani Transmission—although it was accompanied by the usual speculation around margin calls being triggered that typically happen post a sharp and swift fall in share prices. The money for this came from the group’s unlisted entities, which are said to have reserve capital of close to $3 billion to meet any contingency. Then, the development related to timely coupon payments on dollar-denominated bonds was also disseminated promptly by the Adani Group. As things stand, the repayment schedule is on track (See table ‘Bonds Due for Repayment’) with around $2 billion needing to be repaid by the end of next year. Just on the basis of the Rs 30,000-crore cash on the books, meeting that is not a challenge. Further, the group announced that it is mulling an independent assessment in terms of compliance and governance to ensure all transactions and disclosures have been made as per the requisite regulations. It is also planning to prepay $500 million worth of loans that are due in March, which relate to a part of the loan raised to finance the purchase of Holcim’s cement assets in India. The group was earlier mulling refinancing the loans, but then thought it best to prepay given the current scenario. The latest financial numbers of some of the group companies have also highlighted strong guidance, future cash flows and the quantum of debt that will be reduced over time—all aimed at addressing the concerns in the domestic and international markets. Speaking of domestic markets, banks are expected to be reticent till there is clarity on the group’s financial structure. “There is a good chance that the group will go into consolidation mode for the next 1.5-2 years. Diluting stakes in profitable companies may be a sensible and viable option,” says a leading investment banker who wishes to remain anonymous. He says it is a good opportunity to change the composition of the board and just up the game on corporate governance.

Analysts point out that Adani’s play is in the infrastructure space, which is one that has serious entry barriers. “He is the only pure-play infrastructure group in India. For many years, one has seen how the likes of GMR, GVK and Lanco have struggled, and Adani is the only survivor,” says Deven Choksey, Promoter and MD of KRChoksey Group, a wealth management firm. He picks out the government’s thrust on the sector through the allocation of more than Rs 20 lakh crore over the last three Union Budgets. “In the infra space, players have to deal with the government, together with high interest costs, execution of projects using right technology in a time-bound manner. Judging a player only on the basis of its stock price is an incorrect approach,” reasons Choksey, who adds that since these projects “are meant for decades and centuries, valuations must be calculated based on current value of currency under replacement costs and time”. The critical issue relating to the Adani Group seems to be the high valuations the stocks commanded till last year. In a dramatic run-up, the entire Adani pack surged northward for the better part of 2022, increasing the group’s market capitalisation by over 100 per cent. This surge also catapulted Gautam Adani to the position of the third-richest person on the planet for a fair period, before Hindenburg struck. Most market observers now say the stocks were seriously overvalued despite assets being on the ground. Aswath Damodaran, one of the world’s most renowned experts on valuations, believes that the fair value of Adani Enterprises shares is Rs 945, as opposed to its current trading value of around Rs 1,600. “Investors in family group companies, no matter how honourable the family, are buying into cross-holdings, opacity and the possibility of wealth transfers across family group companies. Those risks increase, if the family group companies are built around political connections...,” he said on his blog. But valuations apart, despite the high debt levels, market experts don’t reckon that there is a serious concern around debt. “Debt is not really a concern for the group as it has good quality assets. The only concern was the high valuation,” says Samir Arora, Founder of Helios Capital, a portfolio management services firm. “The message from the market seems to be that ‘don’t be so aggressive in your growth; focus on sustainable growth’. This ongoing issue, however, could impact the future growth plans of the group. The markets have brought some amount of discipline to the Adani Group stocks as shares of some of the group companies were highly valued.”","In 2008, the Adani Group Chairman and Founder survived the 26/11 terrorist attack at Mumbai’s Taj Mahal hotel, where he was dining when the attackers struck.
On January 27, three days after the Hindenburg assault, the Rs 2.4-lakh crore Adani Group’s mothership, Adani Enterprises, opened its much-anticipated Rs 20,000-crore follow-on public offering (FPO).
S&P cut its outlook on two group firms (Adani Ports and Adani Electricity), and Moody’s downgraded its outlook for Adani Green Energy, Adani Green Energy Restricted Group, Adani Transmission Step-One and Adani Electricity Mumbai from stable to negative.
The critical issue relating to the Adani Group seems to be the high valuations the stocks commanded till last year.

Adani Cement's ACC and Ambuja to resume Himachal operations,"Adani Cement, part of the embattled Adani Group, on Monday said its ACC and Ambuja Cements businesses will resume operations at two plants in Himachal Pradesh after resolving issues over freight rates.

All stakeholders have amicably resolved the issues on freight rates in Himachal Pradesh, the company said, adding that ACC and Ambuja will resume operations on Tuesday at the Gagal and Darlaghat plants.

The parties have agreed what equates to a 10-12% cut in overall freight rates from Tuesday, the company said.

""The new freight rates from tomorrow for single axle trucks of 12 tons would be Rs 10.30 Per Ton Per Km for Ambuja Cements’ Darlaghat plant and ACC’s Gagal plant as compared to earlier rates of Rs 11.41 for ACC’s Gagal and Rs 10.58 for Ambuja Cements’ Darlaghat units. The new rates for multi-axle 24 ton trucks would be Rs 9.3 Per Ton Per Km for both units. This will result in overall reduction of 10-12% in the freight rates benefiting the customers of Himachal Pradesh.

""The Gagal and Darlaghat units of ACC & Ambuja Cements are one of the largest industrial units in the state and play a vital role in providing employment & contributing to the economic viability of the state. The reopening of plants will help in the economic, social and overall development of the state,"" said a spokesperson of Adani Cement.

The two plants have been shut for more two months owing to deadlocked negotiations between Adani Group's cement business and Himachal Pradesh-based truck drivers, government officials and truckers have said.

Adani Group is in talks with lenders to repay a $500 million bridge loan facility it had taken to buy controlling stakes in cement companies ACC and Ambuja Cements Ltd last year, the Economic Times daily reported last week.

The group is looking to repay the bridge loan with cash this month, the report said, citing people aware of the matter, adding that the loan had a tenor of six months and was part of a larger $5.25 billion financing package.

The report comes a day after the group said its companies face no material refinancing risk or near-term liquidity issues, in its latest attempt to calm investors spooked by a US short-seller Hindenburg Research's critical report on its business practices.

The loan was underwritten by Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered, said the report.

Weak global cues dented the sentiments at Dalal Street as the inflation worries spooked the traders. Selling pressure in select index heavyweights also dragged the indices lower.

Positive global cues pushed the indices higher during the early trade, but the expiry of weekly derivative series increased the volatility at Dalal Street. Analysts expect the street to remain range-bound in the near future.

For the day, BSE Sensex dropped 316.94 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 61,002.57. The Nifty50 declined 91.65 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 17,944.20. Broader markets tanked in tandem with the headline peers as BSE midcap and smallcap declined about per cent, each. India VIX jumped about 2 per cent to the 13.08 level.



Markets witnessed turbulence on the back of weak global cues as investors booked profit in banking, IT and telecom stocks. Rising inflation, US bond yields, and dollar index are once again creating a lot of uncertainty amongst investors, said Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice-President - Technical Research at Kotak Securities.



""For the bulls, 17,900-17,800 would act as a key support zone while 50-day SMA or 18,100 and 18,200 could be the immediate hurdle. On the flip side, the selling pressure could accelerate if the index slips below 17,800 and in case of further correction, it could slip to 17,700-17,650,"" he said.



All the sectors of Nifty settled in red for the day. Nifty Realty and PSU Bank indices plunged 2 per cent each. Nifty IT, Private Bank and Pharma indices over a per cent, each. Financial services, metal and media indices dropped about a per cent, each.

Among the Adani Group stocks, Adani Enterprises dropped more than 4 per cent as the Supreme Court refused to accept the Centre’s suggestion in a sealed cover. Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas hit lower circuits of 5 per cent, respectively. ACC also settled in the red.

Among the gainers, Adani Wilmar, NDTV and Adani Power hit upper circuits of 5 per cent, each. Adani Green Energy and Ambuja Cement rose 2 per cent. Adani Ports also managed to settle with gains.

Barring the Adani Group stocks, Nestle India declined more than 3 per cent after December quarter earnings. IndusInd Bank and SBI Life Insurance dropped 3 per cent each. HDFC Life, Mahindra & Mahindra, State Bank of India, Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies shed 2 per cent, each.

On the contrary, Larsen & Toubro jumped over 2 per cent, whereas Ultratech Cement, Bharat Petroleum and Hero MotoCorp gained 2 per cent, each. Asian Paints, Coal India and Grasim Industries added a per cent, each, during the day.

A lack of major triggers in the domestic market is attracting global cues to dictate the market trend. The US market is facing an unfavorable combination of higher-than-expected inflation and a stronger job market, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.



""The PPI (Producer Price Index) in the US came in at 6 per cent, in contrast to the expectation of 5.4 per cent. This suggests that interest rates have not yet peaked and will remain elevated for a long period,"" he said.



A total of 3,590 stocks traded for the day on BSE, of which 1,943 ended the day with cuts, while 1,503 settled higher. The remaining 144 stocks ended unchanged. A total of 154 stocks hit an upper circuit on BSE, whereas 203 stocks hit the lower circuit during the trading session.

Adani Ports and SEZ has paid SBI Mutual Funds' due amount of ₹1,000 crore and the unit will also prepay a short-term debt of ₹1,000 crore of commercial papers due next month, a company spokesperson said.

The country's largest-private-sector ports operator used its cash balance and funds generated from business operations to pay its short-term debt.

""This part prepayment is from the existing cash balance and funds generated from the business operations,"" according to the company spokesperson. ""This underscores the confidence which the market has placed on the prudent capital and liquidity management plan for the group.""

“SBI MF had an exposure of around ₹1,000 crore to Adani Group, which has been repaid on maturity. We have no further exposure to the Adani Group,"" said SBI MF spokesperson.

The development follows an earlier announcement by Adani Ports where it said it is considering repaying a debt of nearly ₹5,000 crore in the year starting April, thereby improving net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ratio to about 2.5 times from just over 3 times currently.

The apple-to-airport conglomerate is attempting to soothe investors and lenders who were spooked by allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulations that has put the Adani Group's financial health under the scanner. The Adani Group has denied wrongdoing.

The conglomerate has said that its companies face no material refinancing risk and have no near-term liquidity requirements.

Capital markets regulator Sebi told the Supreme Court earlier this week that it was looking into the short seller's allegations and into market activity immediately before and after the report.

On Friday, Asia Index said it would drop the group's two recent cement acquisitions – Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd – from the S&P BSE 100 ESG Index from 22 February.

The conglomerate is reportedly planning to completely pre-pay all loans against shares over the next 20 days.

Adani Green shares closed 4.99% down on Monday, after losing nearly 70% since the US short seller report. Adani Power climbed 5%, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone ended up 0.24%.

Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken on Friday asked why the Narendra Modi government was “scared” of forming a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe into the Adani-Hindenburg row, stressing that the issue of handing over strategic sectors like airports and ports to a company, was linked to the country’s national security.

The BJP-ruled Centre’s “dealings” with the Adani Group smacks of “crony capitalism” and the creation of “government-sponsored private monopolies”, he said.

The Congress leader said that the Adani Group enjoyed 30% of the port capacity and 40% of the container capacity of the country.

“The Congress party wants to ask the Modi government why it is scared of forming a JPC on the issue. If the then Narasimha Rao government (Congress) could form a JPC for the Harshad Mehta scam, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee (BJP) for Ketan Parekh scam, then why aren’t you setting up a JPC (for Adani stock rout),” he asked.

The Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after US-based short-sheller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate led by Gautam Adani. The Adani Group had dismissed the charges as lies, saying it had complied with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Asked about Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s claim in a recent interview that there were scams of over ₹12 lakh crore during the Congress era, Mr. Maken said that the BJP government had failed to arrest or prove anyone guilty of corruption in these cases in the last nine years of its rule.

“If they could not do anything, they have no right to say anything. ..Congress is demanding a JPC, an investigation into the matter. At least grant us that opportunity for the investigation. You are denying us the probe,” he said.

He said the Congress would continue to press the government for a JPC probe into the issue as it was concerned about ""the open loot of public exchequer to fund crony capitalists”.

“People want to know how one group with doubtful credentials and alleged links with tax haven-operated offshore shell companies is monopolizing the assets of India, but all the government agencies are either missing from the action or facilitating that very process,"" the former Union Minister said.

Points to remember

Whenever privatisation of public assets takes place, he said, two things must be taken care of— one, there should be “one tender, open bid”, and second, there should be no monopoly.

“This government has set aside both these things to help the capitalists close to it,” Mr. Maken said.

“What worries me is that the company which has received ₹37,000 crore and ₹1,23,000 crore from entities located abroad has been handed over strategic sectors like airports and ports. Then this is the biggest threat for the country,” he said.

The Congress leader said the country wanted to know “who is the real owner of the black money being routed to India via offshore shell companies operating from tax havens”.

“What is strange is that this government is not even ready to investigate where this money is coming from, whether it is the money from China or Pakistan. We demand a JPC probe or Supreme Court-monitored investigation, but it (government) is not ready for even that. It is possible that the money invested belongs to China or Pakistan,” he said.

Adani Transmission stock hit lower circuit of 5% to Rs 918.65 (a fresh 52-week low) against the previous close of Rs 966.95 on BSE. The stock opened lower at Rs 950 on BSE today.

Adani Transmission shares are trading lower than the 5-day, 20-day, 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages. The stock has lost 54.44 percent in a year and fallen 64.45 percent since the beginning of this year.

Total 0.93 lakh shares changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 8.77 crore on BSE. Market cap of the firm fell to Rs 1.02 lakh crore. The large-cap stock hit a 52-week high of Rs 4238.55 on September 16, 2022.

S&P said that the allegations related to group governance and disclosures may affect the appetite of fund providers and business partners in supporting ATL’s growth. “This may raise financial and operational risks for the company,” it said.

“S&P Global Ratings today placed its ESG Evaluation of 63 for India-based Adani Transmission Ltd. [ATL] under review. This follows recent allegations of significant governance issues at the Adani group of companies,” it said.

“Our current assessment of ATL’s governance factors in some controlling shareholder’s weight in decision-making, including on related-party transactions. Common parentage and name-sharing also expose ATL to reputational risks from the wider Adani group,” stated the rating agency, further adding that it aims to complete the review in the coming months.

The Hindenburg report, which was released on January 24 this year led to weak sentiment around the Adani Group stocks.

The Adani Transmission stock has lost 66.62% or Rs 1836 since February 24.

In response the Group called Hindenburg report as maliciously mischievous and unresearched, which, it said, adversely affected the Adani Group, its shareholders and investors.

Adani Group had said that the timing of the Hindenburg report's publication clearly betrays a brazen, mala fide intention to undermine the group's reputation with the principal objective of damaging the follow-on public offering from Adani Enterprises, which was the biggest FPO ever in India.

He said that the issues raised by the Opposition were heard by then former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar (PTI Photo)(HT_PRINT)

""The voices of all, including the opposition, were heard in those times. At least the government should have the decency to hear the opposition out,"" he said.

Nitish Kumar was speaking to media persons after he paid tribute to former Bihar CM Karpoori Thakur on his death anniversary.

The Janata Dal (United) leader also criticised the Narendra Modi-led central government over the Income Tax ‘survey’ at BBC offices in Delhi and Mumbai.

When his attention was drawn to the fact that the IT department's survey has come shortly after a documentary produced by the BBC on the Gujarat riots, Kumar responded with a wry smile.

""They (the BBC) have such a wide network. They have been everywhere for so long. If the action (IT raids) is a result of their work, then it is a clear indication that these people (the ruling dispensation) can brook no criticism,"" said Kumar, who had dumped the BJP nearly six months ago.

He also claimed, ""I have never had any problems with any adverse media coverage. I believe in doing my job. For us, it is the people who are supreme (Janata maalik hai).""

The opposition has been trying to corner the Modi government over two issues – allegations of stock manipulation and fraud against Gautam Adani in a scathing report by US short seller Hindenburg Research and a BBC documentary critical of Narendra Modi's role in Gujarat riots.

Earlier this week, tax authorities launched a probe at the BBC India offices weeks after the British broadcaster the documentary about the 2002 Gujarat riots, which the government had dismissed as propaganda.

“The income tax authorities have left our offices in New Delhi and Mumbai,” the BBC said in a statement posted on Twitter late Thursday. “We are supporting staff - many of whom have faced lengthy questioning or been required to stay overnight - and their welfare is our priority.”

Photos: Official Twitter accounts of all four. Advertisement...",None,'Was PM Modi Directly Involved in Adani's Bangladesh Power Deal?: TMC MP Asks EAM,"New Delhi: Trinamool Congress MP Jawhar Sircar has written thrice to external affairs minister S. Jaishankar, requesting that he reveal if Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “himself steering” a power purchase agreement for coal-based supply between Bangladesh and the Adani group.

Sircar wrote the letters in the wake of reports that Bangladesh officials have “expressed unease” about the agreement. Since then, there have been recent allegations of stock manipulation and fraud against the Adani group.

Sircar has also commented in the letters on this “patently unfair PPA (power purchase agreement)” and its ability to trigger a “major anti-India groundswell” in Bangladesh.

Talking to The Wire, Sircar said there has been no response to any of them and that he only decided to make these public after giving the minister “a fair chance”.

MP first wrote in December following WaPo report

In his first letter on the subject, sent on December 13, 2022, Sircar had, while mentioning a report in The Washington Post, headlined ‘How political will often favors a coal billionaire and his dirty fossil fuel,’ pointed out that it spoke of the “special efforts put in by the Prime Minister himself during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015 for a $4.5 billion deal that was signed for India to sell electricity to Bangladesh”.

The Rajya Sabha MP had added that “the report mentions of a $1.7 billion, 1600 MW coal powered plant of the Adani group in Godda district of Jharkhand and how the Washington Post has accessed and analysed the 163-page Power Purchase Agreement”.

He had further brought to the notice of the EAM that the report said that the PPA “mandates that Bangladesh must pay Adani approximately $450 mn a year in capacity and maintenance charges – regardless of whether it generates any electricity. It further mentions that Bangladesh has 40% more power generation than the peak demand and that it would have to buy Adani’s electricity at more than five times the market price of bulk electricity in the country.”

‘Statements providing handle to strong anti-India elements’

The TMC MP had further raised concerns about how “these statements provide a handle to the strong anti-India elements in our neighbouring country” and pointed out that “our [India’s] relationship with Bangladesh is extremely sensitive and such adverse reports circulated in the run-up to elections are the stuff of agitations.”

He had also urged the EAM for a response. On not getting one, Sircar wrote another letter to Jaishankar on January 31, 2023. This was soon after allegations against the Adani group were levelled in the Hindenburg Research report.

As there was still no reply, Sircar in his February 13 letter to the EAM pointed out that “no reply has come. He also wrote that “Adani-related matter are now in the eye of the public storm, and this aspect of his patently unfair PPA with Bangladesh may be triggering a major anti-India groundswell”.

‘Items, documents indicate PM steered deal’

The MP said “there are items and documents to indicate that PM was himself steering this deal/project from his first post-election visit to Dhaka.”

He added that at a later stage, the EAM was “actively involved in pushing this Adani deal through”.

Urging the minister to comment on the matter, Sircar said “we need to know the official version on whether this patently-unfair deal, leading to disaffection in Bangladesh, was actively supported by India or not” and if “MEA did not intervene in Adani’s profiteering at the cost of or relations with Bangladesh”.

MEA distanced itself from deal after Bangladesh sought revision

After the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) earlier this month demanded a revision of the 2017 agreement to buy electricity from the 1600 MW plant of the Adani Power Limited located at Godda, the Union government had distanced itself from the deal.

On being asked about the matter, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had told journalists: “I understand you are referring to a deal between a sovereign government and an Indian company.” On being pressed to state the government’s position in the matter, he had added: “I do not think we are involved in this”.","Sircar wrote the letters in the wake of reports that Bangladesh officials have “expressed unease” about the agreement.

He hailed Balkrishna for reviving Patanjali from a sick company to a firm with a turnover of ₹40,000 crore this financial year due to his professional governance, transparent management and accountability. The dream of making India 'param vaibhavshali' can be achieved by creating empires like Patanjali, he said.

Earlier, Ramdev had claimed that cancer cases has increased in India after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, denying his claim, medical experts said there was no correlation between the two and the rise in cases was a normal phenomenon.

While speaking before a gathering at Miramar beach in Goa where his Patanjali Yog Samiti had organised a yoga camp, Ramdev said, “Cancer has increased a lot. The cases of this disease have gone up after the COVID-19 pandemic. People have lost their eyesight, their sense of hearing…."" Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant was also present with him on the stage.

Prior to that, on 4 February, Ramdev had sparked a controversy wherein he had accused Muslims of resorting to terror and abducting Hindu women while comparing Hinduism to Islam and Christianity. In a gathering in Barmer, Rajasthan, Baba Ramdev had alleged that the two faiths were obsessed with conversion while Hinduism taught its followers to do good.

It was earlier importing LPG via the government-run Visakhapatnam Port.

This comes at a time when Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) on Thursday said that there was no binding agreement or take-or-pay liability in place with Adani Ports.

The statement by the company was in response to TMC leader Mahua Moitra raising a stink of a scam in hiring of the port facility without a tender, contradicted Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited's earning call presentation that said ""MoU signed with IOCL for a take-or-pay contract at Gangavaram Port for building LPG handling facilities"".

Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, as part of the party's 'Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun' (How are we related to Adani) series, posed three questions to PM Modi.

He questioned the PM's role in facilitating an Adani Group ""monopoly"" in the ports sector earlier and Friday's questions were a follow up and related to the IOC agreement to use the LPG facilities in the Gangavaram Port.

""It is now widely known that you (PM) have used all the means at your disposal to help Adani (Group) expand its ports business, whether by giving port concessions in the absence of bidding or by inflicting income tax raids on business groups to encourage them to sell their valuable assets to Adani,"" Ramesh alleged in his statement.

He asked the prime minister why he was ‘intentionally undermining’ the public sector.

""Your government had previously blocked a 2021 bid by the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust for the Dighi Port in Maharashtra, which ended up in Adani's hands. Now we learn that IOC, which was earlier importing LPG via the government-run Visakhapatnam Port, is instead being made to use the neighbouring Gangavaram Port, and that too via an unfavourable 'take-or-pay' contract,"" the Congress leader charged.

""Do you view India's public sector simply as a tool to enrich your cronies,"" tweeted Congress leader Ramesh.

He pointed out that IOC has clarified that it has only signed a non-binding MoU with Adani Ports and that there is no binding take-or-pay agreement ‘as of now’.

""Did Adani Ports inadvertently reveal the game before it was finalised? Does the signing of an MoU not clearly indicate the direction in which IOC is being pushed? Does the fact that a take-or-pay contract was at all on the table not betray the fact that Adani was going to be made the primary port for the import of LPG rather than one of many, as IOC has stated,"" he asked.

Ramesh said the state-run Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) is a major shareholder in IOC with an 8.3 per cent stake worth ₹9,400 crore, and also a major shareholder in Adani Ports and SEZ with a stake of 9.1 per cent worth ₹1,130 crore.

""Where is the due diligence by government shareholders? Who is looking out for the interests of the shareholders of IOC? Or is this loot being carried out under your benevolent gaze and restraining hand,"" he asked.

The Congress has been demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the allegations against the Adani Group by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research.

A Hindenburg report has levelled allegations of financial irregularities and stock manipulation against Adani Group companies. The Adani Group has dismissed the allegations as baseless.

In his fresh attack on the Narendra Modi-led government at the centre, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi questioned why the Adani Group was given contracts despite the fact that they lacked prior experiences.

In the video, Rahul Gandhi goes on to allege that Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over six airports to the Adani group under Public Private Partnership in 2018.

Then a year later, the Indian government handed over Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, and Jaipur to the Adani Group. Gandhi also shared a poster of PM Modi with Gautam Adani.

“I spoke the truth in Parliament about the ties between PM Modi and Adani. With evidence, I spoke on how India's wealth is being looted. This truth was expunged from Parliament records"", Rahul Gandhi said, referring to his Lok Sabha speech on 8 February.

During his Lok Sabha speech, Rahul Gandhi had alleged that the Modi government changed certain laws in favour of Adani, who hails from the PM's home state of Gujarat.

“Why were six airports handed over to one company? Finance Ministry, NITI Aayog, AAI raised objections. By whom and why was it overruled? Concession lease was for 30 years, why was it increased to 50 years for Adani?"", Gandhi asked.

Meanwhile, posing a set of three questions to the government on the Adani issue as part of the party's 'Hum Adani Ke Hain Kaun (HAHK)' series, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said following the Hindenburg report, the world's biggest stock index provider MSCI announced that it would reduce the weightage of Adani Group stocks in its indices in the coming months.

The second largest provider, S&P Dow Jones, stated that it would remove Adani Enterprises from its sustainablity indices, while the third largest, FTSE Russell, announced it would make changes to the weightage of Adani Group companies in its indices effective March 20, he said.

""Should the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) not be trying to protect retail investors by at least ensuring that suspect companies' positions in key indices are reviewed?"" the Congress leader asked.

He also claimed that far from reviewing the inclusion of Adani Enterprises in the Nifty 50, the NSE announced on February 17 that four more Adani Group companies would be included in the NSE indices.

The Opposition has been demanding a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into allegations against Adani by US-based agency Hindenburg.

Almost a month to the day since that damning report made global headlines, one of the group's stocks, Adani Total Gas , is within striking distance of achieving that valuation. On Wednesday, the stock on BSE closed at Rs 835, down nearly 79% from its January 24 close.

Since January 24 this year, Adani stocks took a major hit after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research alleged that the Gautam Adani-led Indian conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the last few decades. Adani Group, however, refuted the claim as baseless. At today's closing, the scathing allegation has resulted in an erosion of $134 billion from Adani Group's market value.

The $134 billion stock rout in Adani Group shares equals 4.22 per cent of India's annual GDP, which is estimated at $3.17 trillion. The value erosion in Adani group shares also equals the annual GDP of Angola. 10 of Adani Group stocks commanded a combined m-cap of Rs 8,09,182 crore today, which at the rupee-dollar exchange rate of 82.76 were valued at $98 billion.

This was down Rs 11,10,706 crore ($134 billion) from Rs 19,19,888 crore value, the group commanded as on January 24 this year.

At Adani Enterprises' recent earnings announcement, the Adani group said it has assessed that no material financial adjustment arises to the consolidated financial results for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the said allegations.

While announcing Adani Enterprises Q3 results, Gautam Adani termed the market volatility as temporary and said that the flagship firm would continue to leverage while looking at strategic opportunities to expand and grow.

In value terms, Adani Total Gas has lost the most. The stock eroded Rs 3.30 lakh crore in market value. Adani Total Gas's m-cap came at Rs 96,656.81 crore today against Rs 4.27 lakh crore as on January 24.

Three of the group's stocks namely, Adani Transmission, Adani Enterprises and Adani Green Energy have eroded over Rs 2 lakh crore, each, in terms of market value. Adani Power and Adani Ports & SEZ have also seen value erosion of up to Rs 39,977 crore.

Also, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Green tanked 5 per cent today, each, to hit their respective one-year low levels. Adani Wilmar shares slipped 4.33 per cent; while Adani Enterprises settled 3.16 per cent lower.

Meanwhile, the 30-share BSE Sensex pack edged 19 points, or 0.03 per cent, down to settle at 60,673. The broader NSE Nifty index fell 18 points, or 0.10 per cent, to close at 17,827.

A U.S.-based short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a 106-page forensic report accusing Adani and his companies of a vast scheme of stock manipulation and fraud, using a complex system of shell companies. And poof: Within days, and despite Adani’s denial of the allegations, more than $110 billion of the companies’ market capitalization vanished, leaving Adani himself around $58 billion poorer in paper wealth. Can the plot thicken any further? It certainly can. The Adani affair could become India’s so-called Lehman moment—leading to the unraveling not only of one of India’s largest and best-connected corporate empires but of an entire nation’s ambitions to harness what will soon be the world’s largest population in an effort to realize the country’s vast economic potential.

But ironically, the Adani crisis is exactly what India needs right now to accelerate its journey. There is much complacency among the Indian elite and around the world. The country’s size, burgeoning market, youthful demographics, and politically muscular government makes India’s rise inevitable; fix its physical infrastructure, and the world will be beating down India’s door to invest in and do business with—or so the mantra goes. Poor corporate governance, crony capitalism, defanged regulators, and uncritical media are just part of the price to be paid for India’s rise. After the Adani jolt, there will inevitably be a reexamination of the India narrative, with fresh attention paid to fixing India’s system of economic and corporate governance.

Until that happens, it is not hard to imagine the many ways in which the Adani crisis can cause lasting damage. His sprawling conglomerate has been key to tackling India’s infrastructure challenges, from an inadequate transportation and logistics system to an unreliable energy supply. The Adani Group controls India’s largest airport company, the largest private port operator, and the second-largest cement-maker. Adani warehouses store almost a third of India’s grain, Adani Enterprises is the largest coal trader in the country, and it controls 20 percent of India’s power transmission lines. He is also leading the charge on a planned $50 billion hydrogen ecosystem, manufactures photovoltaic cells and wind turbines, and distributes wind energy. If Adani stalls, many argue, then so could India’s progress.

Adani’s travails have implications beyond these specific sectors. India needs investment and deep financial markets; here, too, the crisis pinches. At one point, Adani companies accounted for 6 percent of shares traded on India’s two main stock exchanges and were responsible for 7 percent of total capital investment of India’s 500 largest nonfinancial firms. Now, foreign investors might look at Hindenburg’s accusations as a sign of deeper rot in corporate India, and they may worry that the country is too risky an investment. Indeed, many foreign investors already believe the Indian stock market is overpriced and have therefore reduced their exposure to the country’s assets. Since the Hindenburg report, S&P Global Ratings cut its outlook on two of Adani’s dollar bonds to negative, and there has been a wholesale withdrawal from Adani holdings by Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest stock investor. Other investors are bound to get skittish.

The personal bond between Adani and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is common knowledge.

In the meantime, the crisis has also exposed India’s financial markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, as having been asleep at the wheel. India’s news media also chose to look the other way. Before the Hindenburg report, media outlets that raised questions about Adani faced lawsuits and arrest warrants, and the rest went into self-censorship. After the Hindenburg report appeared, major TV news channels managed to ignore the story on their prime time shows for two whole days, according to Alt News, a leading fact-checking site. In fact, one of the last bastions of independent journalism among India’s mainstream media, NDTV, was acquired by Adani in December 2022. The government has been mostly silent on the crisis. The personal bond between Adani and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is common knowledge.

The Adani crisis also threatens India’s international geopolitical standing. India has been building influence in its neighborhood as a stepping stone toward its global aspirations. Unlike China’s far more ambitious, state-led Belt and Road Initiative, India’s forays have been channeled via the private sector. Adani has been on the forefront of supplying electricity to Bangladesh, building ports in Sri Lanka, and mining coal in Indonesia and Australia. Stalling Adani, especially because of his strong connections to the government, could raise questions about the Modi administration’s foreign economic policy and affect India’s credibility abroad.

There is no doubt that India’s progress will hit a speed bump in the near term as Adani struggles to maintain focus, retain the trust of key partners, and raise capital. That said, Adani’s companies deal in tangible products; this is no cryptocurrency exchange. They are backed by hard assets and generate cash. Adani’s power projects, for example, rely on the government as a reliable customer and revenue source; no matter what happens to Adani personally, fast-growing India has an unending demand for his products. His businesses generate rivers of cash that can service debt or—in the eventuality of a sell-off—attract buyers. Either Adani will continue to operate the businesses or someone else will.

What about the possibility of a financial market contagion? The risk of a default on Adani debt could ease as distressed debt specialists and hedge funds see opportunities in the crisis and look to buy Adani bonds at a bargain. There have been reassuring words from various analysts to shore up confidence in Indian markets. Goldman Sachs analysts noted that the crisis is “unlikely to have a broader contagion impact.” The Indian central bank governor declared that “the strength, size, and resilience of the Indian banking system now are much stronger and larger to be affected by a case like this.” At the same time, key state-owned financial sector enterprises, such as the Life Insurance Corporation and the State Bank of India, have only limited exposure to Adani companies. Most significantly, India has a well-capitalized stock market, with more than a $3 trillion turnover annually; India’s Nifty 50 index remains nearly 2.5 percent above where it was at this time last year.

What’s more: Sentiment matters. The world needs the India story to work. It is a standout nation in a post-pandemic global economy rife with problems: slowdowns in the West, a war in Europe, jitters in China, and a growing rift between Beijing and key players in the global economy. India’s key role in shaping the world’s digital and environmental agenda is undeniable. In its role presiding over the G-20 this year, New Delhi will work hard to make the case that the world cannot make progress unless India makes progress.

For all the concerns raised by the crisis, the risk looks like it can be managed for now. But no matter how the plot unfolds, one thing is clear: The Adani crisis has delivered an unexpected benefit by serving as a harsh reminder that India’s greatest obstacle is not its still-rickety physical infrastructure. Above all, India must repair the broken state of its systems of governance, transparency, and checks and balances—in other words, the soft infrastructure within corporate boardrooms, at the nexus of business and government, and among watchdogs, including the media. The Hindenburg report’s greatest gift is that it may rattle India’s business, government, and media elite just enough for this reform process to finally get underway.","People’s eyes glaze over when they hear the word “infrastructure,” but there has been nothing boring about the unraveling of India’s infrastructure king, Gautam Adani.

The combined market value of the group’s shares fell to below $100 billion earlier this week, bringing to $135 billion the loss of market capitalisation since the US-based Hindenburg Research published a report on January 24 alleging widespread accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

The group’s founder, Gautum Adani, at one stage ranked the third richest man in the world, has close connections with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.



Adani has denied the allegations and wrapped himself in the Indian flag, claiming they were an attempt to take down the country. But his protestations and efforts to provide assurances to the markets that the financial position of his group is sound have not halted the slide.

The Hindenburg allegations, which it said were the result of a two-year investigation, claimed that the Adani Group was “pulling the largest con game in corporate history.” The increase in the group’s share values over the past three years of more than $100 billion was “largely through stock price appreciation in the group’s seven listed companies” which spiked an average 819 percent in that period.

Despite its name, Hindenburg’s investigation was not disinterested academic research. It is well known as a shorting investor. Shorting involves borrowing shares in a firm and selling them in the expectation the price will fall, then buying them back at the lower price, returning them to the lender and profiting from the transaction.

While there are restrictions on such activities in India, Hindenburg seems to have found a way to short Adani stock, according to a report in the Financial Times. The founder of Hindenburg, Nathan Anderson, has not indicated how he organised his bet against the Adani group saying only that he had taken a short position “through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.”

But the withdrawal of money goes well beyond the activities of Hindenburg. Adani suffered a significant blow when the ratings agency Moody’s cut its outlook on four companies in the group from “stable” to “negative” while leaving ratings unchanged.

Moody’s said its decision was the result of “the significant and rapid decline in the market equity values of the Adani Group” following the release of the Hindenburg report.

Like many corporate giants, Adani has sought to advance an ESG (environment, social governance) program to capture funds from so-called ethical investment.

Norway’s largest pension fund, KLP, recently dumped its entire holding of shares in Adani’s Green Energy on the basis that it may have been financing polluting activities. In particular the Carmichael coal mine project in central Queensland, Australia, has been the subject of intense opposition on environmental grounds.

Bloomberg reported that a public filing on February 10 “made clear that Adani is using stock from its Green companies as collateral in a credit facility that’s helping to finance the Carmichael coal mine.”

The money invested in the Adani green companies is not directly involved. But to the extent that it raises their share values it increases the value of the collateral used to finance other, polluting projects and thereby lowers the cost of loans to finance them.

KLP has banned investment in coal. According to its head of responsible investing, Kiran Aziz, any indirect financing of the Carmichael project would be a “breach of our commitments.”

The withdrawal of money could be extended. According to Bloomberg, there are more than 500 funds in the European Union which are registered as “promoting” ESG goals and which hold Adani stocks either directly or indirectly.

According to the Hindenburg report, the notion that the operations of the Adani companies were in some way separate from each other was a fiction. It noted that “Adani Group companies are intricately linked and dependent upon one another” and that none of the entities “are isolated from the performance, failure, of the other group companies.”

Announcing the withdrawal of money by KLP, which manages funds of around $75 billion, Aziz said: “Adani’s corporate structure created an unacceptably high risk that ‘clean’ investment could be siphoned off towards coal mining.”

But this reaction could well be taken with a large grain of salt because the complex and interconnected structure of the Adani group was well known before the Hindenburg report.

The intimate connection between the Adani group and the Modi government means that its possible demise will have significant political consequences. While the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has declared it has “nothing to hide,” Modi has remained silent.

Others, however, are questioning whether Modi will be able to ride out the storm.

Speaking at the recent Munich Security Conference, multi-billionaire George Soros, who made his fortune as a hedge fund manager, said: “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies; their fate is intertwined.”

Soros said that Adani had tried to raise funds in the stock market but had failed.

“Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards. Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament.”

He claimed the Adani demise would weaken Modi’s stranglehold on the federal government, open the way for much needed institutional reforms and even bring about a “democratic revival in India.”

What Soros means by a “democratic revival” is not an end to the domination of the Indian economy by corporate and financial giants. He wants a weakening of the control exercised by Modi over economy and finance which has been used for the benefit of “insiders” such as Adani. This would open the way for other sections of finance capital, for which Soros speaks, to benefit from the plunder of the country’s resources and the exploitation of its labour.","In the month since the publication of explosive accusations about its financial operations, the India-based Adani group of companies has been undergoing a not-so-slow train wreck.

Several major superannuation funds, including those that cater for government workers in Queensland and employees at the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), invested in the company after allocating money to emerging markets to boost returns.

Australia’s $243bn Future Fund, which was set up to strengthen the commonwealth’s long-term financial position, also has an exposure to two Adani companies that are now worth a fraction of the original investment.

“Any super fund investing in Adani Group companies has failed its members on climate action and due diligence,” Will van de Pol, a Market Forces asset management campaigner, said.

Analysis of superannuation holdings by the climate activist group shows that the investments are collectively worth tens of millions of dollars, but only represent a small fraction of an individual fund due to the diversified nature of their stock holdings.

Adani companies have been subject to relentless selling since a 24 January report by US investor Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation and accounting fraud.

Adani Group published a 413-page rebuttal of the allegations, likening the US short-seller’s report to an attack on India, but it has been unable to arrest a relentless slide in the value of the company.

Shares in seven listed Adani companies have shed about US$125bn (A$182bn) since the report, representing well over half the value of the ports-to-power conglomerate that runs Australia’s contentious Carmichael coalmine and rail project in Queensland.

“These funds have used members’ money to prop up Adani’s unacceptable coal expansion plans, including the disastrous Carmichael mine, and failed to see glaring investment risks that existed for years before being outlined in the Hindenburg report,” Van de Pol said.

The Australian Retirement Trust, a Brisbane-headquartered manager with more than $200bn in assets, was exposed to at least six Adani entities worth several million dollars before the report was released.

The investment was part of a “passive” allocation, whereby the fund appoints external fund managers to invest on its behalf in a particular country or sector, often tracking an index.

The fund, which offers products to Queensland government employees and their families as part of its service, did not respond to questions.

CBA’s super fund for its workers, Group Super, had a small exposure as did Brighter Super, which is the traditional fund for local government employees in Queensland.

“The fund has a very small exposure to Adani via two passive, indexed portfolios,” Brighter’s chief investment officer, Mark Rider, said, adding that the $2.5m investment represented 0.008% of the fund’s overall holdings.

Following a freedom-of-information request by former senator Rex Patrick, the Future Fund recently disclosed it had a $33.1m investment in two Adani companies before the share price collapse.

One of those companies, Adani Total Gas, has so far in 2023 lost 75% of its value.

The Future Fund’s chief executive, Raphael Arndt, told a Senate committee last week the investment was made through an external fund manager with a mandate to invest in emerging markets, such as India.

“Those managers run their own due diligence on the companies they invest in,” Arndt said.

The large size of the Adani conglomerate, which is the biggest airport and private seaport owner in India, meant its shares found their way into the portfolios of many fund managers around the world seeking to profit from the rise of the Indian economy.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund had a sizeable holding, but sold most of its Adani stakes before the share collapse.

The $70bn Hesta fund, primarily catering for health and community service workers, had one of the larger exposures to Adani among Australian funds in recent years.","Tens of millions of dollars worth of Australian retirement savings have been exposed to the beleaguered Adani Group as the Indian conglomerate faces a stock rout after allegations of fraud.

Almost a month to the day since that damning report made global headlines, one of the group's stocks, Adani Total Gas , is within striking distance of achieving that valuation.

Since January 24 this year, Adani stocks took a major hit after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research alleged that the Gautam Adani-led Indian conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the last few decades. Adani Group, however, refuted the claim as baseless. At today's closing, the scathing allegation has resulted in an erosion of $134 billion from Adani Group's market value.

The $134 billion stock rout in Adani Group shares equals 4.22 per cent of India's annual GDP, which is estimated at $3.17 trillion.

At Adani Enterprises' recent earnings announcement, the Adani group said it has assessed that no material financial adjustment arises to the consolidated financial results for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the said allegations.

While announcing Adani Enterprises Q3 results, Gautam Adani termed the market volatility as temporary and said that the flagship firm would continue to leverage while looking at strategic opportunities to expand and grow.

In value terms, Adani Total Gas has lost the most. The stock eroded Rs 3.30 lakh crore in market value. Adani Total Gas's m-cap came at Rs 96,656.81 crore today against Rs 4.27 lakh crore as on January 24.

A U.S.-based short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a 106-page forensic report accusing Adani and his companies of a vast scheme of stock manipulation and fraud, using a complex system of shell companies. And poof: Within days, and despite Adani’s denial of the allegations, more than $110 billion of the companies’ market capitalization vanished, leaving Adani himself around $58 billion poorer in paper wealth. Can the plot thicken any further? It certainly can. The Adani affair could become India’s so-called Lehman moment—leading to the unraveling not only of one of India’s largest and best-connected corporate empires but of an entire nation’s ambitions to harness what will soon be the world’s largest population in an effort to realize the country’s vast economic potential.

But ironically, the Adani crisis is exactly what India needs right now to accelerate its journey. There is much complacency among the Indian elite and around the world. The country’s size, burgeoning market, youthful demographics, and politically muscular government makes India’s rise inevitable; fix its physical infrastructure, and the world will be beating down India’s door to invest in and do business with—or so the mantra goes. Poor corporate governance, crony capitalism, defanged regulators, and uncritical media are just part of the price to be paid for India’s rise. After the Adani jolt, there will inevitably be a reexamination of the India narrative, with fresh attention paid to fixing India’s system of economic and corporate governance.

Until that happens, it is not hard to imagine the many ways in which the Adani crisis can cause lasting damage. His sprawling conglomerate has been key to tackling India’s infrastructure challenges, from an inadequate transportation and logistics system to an unreliable energy supply. The Adani Group controls India’s largest airport company, the largest private port operator, and the second-largest cement-maker. Adani warehouses store almost a third of India’s grain, Adani Enterprises is the largest coal trader in the country, and it controls 20 percent of India’s power transmission lines. He is also leading the charge on a planned $50 billion hydrogen ecosystem, manufactures photovoltaic cells and wind turbines, and distributes wind energy. If Adani stalls, many argue, then so could India’s progress.

Adani’s travails have implications beyond these specific sectors. India needs investment and deep financial markets; here, too, the crisis pinches. At one point, Adani companies accounted for 6 percent of shares traded on India’s two main stock exchanges and were responsible for 7 percent of total capital investment of India’s 500 largest nonfinancial firms. Now, foreign investors might look at Hindenburg’s accusations as a sign of deeper rot in corporate India, and they may worry that the country is too risky an investment. Indeed, many foreign investors already believe the Indian stock market is overpriced and have therefore reduced their exposure to the country’s assets. Since the Hindenburg report, S&P Global Ratings cut its outlook on two of Adani’s dollar bonds to negative, and there has been a wholesale withdrawal from Adani holdings by Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest stock investor. Other investors are bound to get skittish.

The personal bond between Adani and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is common knowledge.

In the meantime, the crisis has also exposed India’s financial markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, as having been asleep at the wheel. India’s news media also chose to look the other way. Before the Hindenburg report, media outlets that raised questions about Adani faced lawsuits and arrest warrants, and the rest went into self-censorship. After the Hindenburg report appeared, major TV news channels managed to ignore the story on their prime time shows for two whole days, according to Alt News, a leading fact-checking site. In fact, one of the last bastions of independent journalism among India’s mainstream media, NDTV, was acquired by Adani in December 2022. The government has been mostly silent on the crisis. The personal bond between Adani and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is common knowledge.

The Adani crisis also threatens India’s international geopolitical standing. India has been building influence in its neighborhood as a stepping stone toward its global aspirations. Unlike China’s far more ambitious, state-led Belt and Road Initiative, India’s forays have been channeled via the private sector. Adani has been on the forefront of supplying electricity to Bangladesh, building ports in Sri Lanka, and mining coal in Indonesia and Australia. Stalling Adani, especially because of his strong connections to the government, could raise questions about the Modi administration’s foreign economic policy and affect India’s credibility abroad.

There is no doubt that India’s progress will hit a speed bump in the near term as Adani struggles to maintain focus, retain the trust of key partners, and raise capital. That said, Adani’s companies deal in tangible products; this is no cryptocurrency exchange. They are backed by hard assets and generate cash. Adani’s power projects, for example, rely on the government as a reliable customer and revenue source; no matter what happens to Adani personally, fast-growing India has an unending demand for his products. His businesses generate rivers of cash that can service debt or—in the eventuality of a sell-off—attract buyers. Either Adani will continue to operate the businesses or someone else will.

What about the possibility of a financial market contagion? The risk of a default on Adani debt could ease as distressed debt specialists and hedge funds see opportunities in the crisis and look to buy Adani bonds at a bargain. There have been reassuring words from various analysts to shore up confidence in Indian markets. Goldman Sachs analysts noted that the crisis is “unlikely to have a broader contagion impact.” The Indian central bank governor declared that “the strength, size, and resilience of the Indian banking system now are much stronger and larger to be affected by a case like this.” At the same time, key state-owned financial sector enterprises, such as the Life Insurance Corporation and the State Bank of India, have only limited exposure to Adani companies. Most significantly, India has a well-capitalized stock market, with more than a $3 trillion turnover annually; India’s Nifty 50 index remains nearly 2.5 percent above where it was at this time last year.

What’s more: Sentiment matters. The world needs the India story to work. It is a standout nation in a post-pandemic global economy rife with problems: slowdowns in the West, a war in Europe, jitters in China, and a growing rift between Beijing and key players in the global economy. India’s key role in shaping the world’s digital and environmental agenda is undeniable. In its role presiding over the G-20 this year, New Delhi will work hard to make the case that the world cannot make progress unless India makes progress.

For all the concerns raised by the crisis, the risk looks like it can be managed for now. But no matter how the plot unfolds, one thing is clear: The Adani crisis has delivered an unexpected benefit by serving as a harsh reminder that India’s greatest obstacle is not its still-rickety physical infrastructure. Above all, India must repair the broken state of its systems of governance, transparency, and checks and balances—in other words, the soft infrastructure within corporate boardrooms, at the nexus of business and government, and among watchdogs, including the media. The Hindenburg report’s greatest gift is that it may rattle India’s business, government, and media elite just enough for this reform process to finally get underway.","People’s eyes glaze over when they hear the word “infrastructure,” but there has been nothing boring about the unraveling of India’s infrastructure king, Gautam Adani.

The combined market value of the group’s shares fell to below $100 billion earlier this week, bringing to $135 billion the loss of market capitalisation since the US-based Hindenburg Research published a report on January 24 alleging widespread accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

The group’s founder, Gautum Adani, at one stage ranked the third richest man in the world, has close connections with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.



Adani has denied the allegations and wrapped himself in the Indian flag, claiming they were an attempt to take down the country. But his protestations and efforts to provide assurances to the markets that the financial position of his group is sound have not halted the slide.

The Hindenburg allegations, which it said were the result of a two-year investigation, claimed that the Adani Group was “pulling the largest con game in corporate history.” The increase in the group’s share values over the past three years of more than $100 billion was “largely through stock price appreciation in the group’s seven listed companies” which spiked an average 819 percent in that period.

Despite its name, Hindenburg’s investigation was not disinterested academic research. It is well known as a shorting investor. Shorting involves borrowing shares in a firm and selling them in the expectation the price will fall, then buying them back at the lower price, returning them to the lender and profiting from the transaction.

While there are restrictions on such activities in India, Hindenburg seems to have found a way to short Adani stock, according to a report in the Financial Times. The founder of Hindenburg, Nathan Anderson, has not indicated how he organised his bet against the Adani group saying only that he had taken a short position “through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.”

But the withdrawal of money goes well beyond the activities of Hindenburg. Adani suffered a significant blow when the ratings agency Moody’s cut its outlook on four companies in the group from “stable” to “negative” while leaving ratings unchanged.

Moody’s said its decision was the result of “the significant and rapid decline in the market equity values of the Adani Group” following the release of the Hindenburg report.

Like many corporate giants, Adani has sought to advance an ESG (environment, social governance) program to capture funds from so-called ethical investment.

Norway’s largest pension fund, KLP, recently dumped its entire holding of shares in Adani’s Green Energy on the basis that it may have been financing polluting activities. In particular the Carmichael coal mine project in central Queensland, Australia, has been the subject of intense opposition on environmental grounds.

Bloomberg reported that a public filing on February 10 “made clear that Adani is using stock from its Green companies as collateral in a credit facility that’s helping to finance the Carmichael coal mine.”

The money invested in the Adani green companies is not directly involved. But to the extent that it raises their share values it increases the value of the collateral used to finance other, polluting projects and thereby lowers the cost of loans to finance them.

KLP has banned investment in coal. According to its head of responsible investing, Kiran Aziz, any indirect financing of the Carmichael project would be a “breach of our commitments.”

The withdrawal of money could be extended. According to Bloomberg, there are more than 500 funds in the European Union which are registered as “promoting” ESG goals and which hold Adani stocks either directly or indirectly.

According to the Hindenburg report, the notion that the operations of the Adani companies were in some way separate from each other was a fiction. It noted that “Adani Group companies are intricately linked and dependent upon one another” and that none of the entities “are isolated from the performance, failure, of the other group companies.”

Announcing the withdrawal of money by KLP, which manages funds of around $75 billion, Aziz said: “Adani’s corporate structure created an unacceptably high risk that ‘clean’ investment could be siphoned off towards coal mining.”

But this reaction could well be taken with a large grain of salt because the complex and interconnected structure of the Adani group was well known before the Hindenburg report.

The intimate connection between the Adani group and the Modi government means that its possible demise will have significant political consequences. While the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has declared it has “nothing to hide,” Modi has remained silent.

Others, however, are questioning whether Modi will be able to ride out the storm.

Speaking at the recent Munich Security Conference, multi-billionaire George Soros, who made his fortune as a hedge fund manager, said: “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies; their fate is intertwined.”

Soros said that Adani had tried to raise funds in the stock market but had failed.

“Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards. Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament.”

He claimed the Adani demise would weaken Modi’s stranglehold on the federal government, open the way for much needed institutional reforms and even bring about a “democratic revival in India.”

What Soros means by a “democratic revival” is not an end to the domination of the Indian economy by corporate and financial giants. He wants a weakening of the control exercised by Modi over economy and finance which has been used for the benefit of “insiders” such as Adani. This would open the way for other sections of finance capital, for which Soros speaks, to benefit from the plunder of the country’s resources and the exploitation of its labour.","In the month since the publication of explosive accusations about its financial operations, the India-based Adani group of companies has been undergoing a not-so-slow train wreck.

Many of Adani firms also hit their lower circuit in today's trade.

Four other Adani Group stocks – Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, Adani Wilmar, and Adani Green – were locked in their 5% lower circuit limits.

Shares of Adani Power fell 5%, and NDTV also hit a lower circuit of 5%. The stock of Adani Ports and ACC fell 6%, respectively.

The broader equity market also faced weak trend as the BSE Sensex tanked 927.74 points to settle at 59,744.98, while Nifty fell 272.40 points to 17,554.30.

The selling pressure in the Adani Group stocks have added to the bearish mood on D-Street. With Adani Enterprises losing the most at 11%, all 10 stocks of the Adani Group ended in the red.

""Adani group's market capitalisation is now down 70% from its peak, from around Rs.25 lakh crore to 7.55 lakh crore,"" said Rohan Shah, head technical analyst at Stoxbox.

A total of 88 questions were raised by Hindenburg Research in its scathing report. Out of them, 65 were related to the listed companies, six were related to media reports and rest were on family offices, said Adani Group CFO Jugeshinder Singh.

Singh, a speaker at Kotak Chasing Growth - 2023 Conference, said a total of 65 questions were not something the group didn’t disclose previously.

Singh said the group's gross debt stands at $30 billion at the gross level and $26 billion at the net level.

Several major superannuation funds, including those that cater for government workers in Queensland and employees at the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), invested in the company after allocating money to emerging markets to boost returns.

Australia’s $243bn Future Fund, which was set up to strengthen the commonwealth’s long-term financial position, also has an exposure to two Adani companies that are now worth a fraction of the original investment.

“Any super fund investing in Adani Group companies has failed its members on climate action and due diligence,” Will van de Pol, a Market Forces asset management campaigner, said.

Analysis of superannuation holdings by the climate activist group shows that the investments are collectively worth tens of millions of dollars, but only represent a small fraction of an individual fund due to the diversified nature of their stock holdings.

Adani companies have been subject to relentless selling since a 24 January report by US investor Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation and accounting fraud.

Adani Group published a 413-page rebuttal of the allegations, likening the US short-seller’s report to an attack on India, but it has been unable to arrest a relentless slide in the value of the company.

Shares in seven listed Adani companies have shed about US$125bn (A$182bn) since the report, representing well over half the value of the ports-to-power conglomerate that runs Australia’s contentious Carmichael coalmine and rail project in Queensland.

“These funds have used members’ money to prop up Adani’s unacceptable coal expansion plans, including the disastrous Carmichael mine, and failed to see glaring investment risks that existed for years before being outlined in the Hindenburg report,” Van de Pol said.

The Australian Retirement Trust, a Brisbane-headquartered manager with more than $200bn in assets, was exposed to at least six Adani entities worth several million dollars before the report was released.

The investment was part of a “passive” allocation, whereby the fund appoints external fund managers to invest on its behalf in a particular country or sector, often tracking an index.

The fund, which offers products to Queensland government employees and their families as part of its service, did not respond to questions.

CBA’s super fund for its workers, Group Super, had a small exposure as did Brighter Super, which is the traditional fund for local government employees in Queensland.

“The fund has a very small exposure to Adani via two passive, indexed portfolios,” Brighter’s chief investment officer, Mark Rider, said, adding that the $2.5m investment represented 0.008% of the fund’s overall holdings.

Following a freedom-of-information request by former senator Rex Patrick, the Future Fund recently disclosed it had a $33.1m investment in two Adani companies before the share price collapse.

One of those companies, Adani Total Gas, has so far in 2023 lost 75% of its value.

The Future Fund’s chief executive, Raphael Arndt, told a Senate committee last week the investment was made through an external fund manager with a mandate to invest in emerging markets, such as India.

“Those managers run their own due diligence on the companies they invest in,” Arndt said.

The large size of the Adani conglomerate, which is the biggest airport and private seaport owner in India, meant its shares found their way into the portfolios of many fund managers around the world seeking to profit from the rise of the Indian economy.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund had a sizeable holding, but sold most of its Adani stakes before the share collapse.

The $70bn Hesta fund, primarily catering for health and community service workers, had one of the larger exposures to Adani among Australian funds in recent years.","Tens of millions of dollars worth of Australian retirement savings have been exposed to the beleaguered Adani Group as the Indian conglomerate faces a stock rout after allegations of fraud.

By end of February 22nd, Adani firms' market valuation dropped by 70% from its peak level.

As Adani firms embattle allegations of the Hindenburg report in court, last week, it looks like the rating companies were asked by Sebi to share the information including all outstanding ratings, outlook, and possible updates from any discussions with Adani Group officials.

A person aware of the communication from the regulator told Economic Times, ""Sebi is probably trying to ascertain whether the sharp fall in stock prices of several Adani companies would have any bearing on the liquidity positions and the debt repayment capability of the borrowing companies...

On the occasion of completion of 30 years of diplomatic relations between Israel and India, the Israeli envoy emphasised the importance of Adani’s investment as 'strategic' and looked forward to more investments by the the company in other sectors of Israel.

“We have two ports in the Mediterranean. It’s (Haifa) a strategic asset. The fact that we are giving it to an Indian company, from our point of view, is symbolic sign of deep trust in depositing your strategic assets in the hands of Indian companies,” Ambassador Gilon said.

The envoy's comments come at a time when damning allegations by a US short seller has led to a stock market sell-off for Adani Group companies.

“Adani Group’s bread and butter are ports. They have the potential to make Haifa port what it needs to be and to utilise it to increase trade between India and Israel. We are very happy with this,” he added.

Last month, the Adani Group acquired the strategic Israeli port of Haifa for $1.2 billion and vowed to transform the skyline of this Mediterranean city as part of its decision to invest more in the Jewish nation, including opening an artificial intelligence lab in Tel Aviv.

Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani, whose business empire was rocked by allegations of fraud by US short seller Hindenburg Research, appeared alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for signing of the deal to takeover Haifa Port, and spoke of investment opportunities.

Prime Minister Netanyahu described the Haifa port deal with the Adani Group as an ''enormous milestone'', saying it will significantly improve connectivity between the two countries in many ways.

The Port of Haifa is the second largest port in Israel in terms of shipping containers and the biggest in shipping tourist cruise ships.

“The Adani Group paid in full for the Haifa port and there is money for development. Port infrastructure is the core business of Adani Group and they know what to do. It is a strategic asset and will be useful for India and for Israel.”

He added, “Adani Group are looking for more projects in Israel and I hope they succeed in getting it… We want our friends to be close by. We are very comfortable with India.”

To a question on Rahul Gandhi’s remarks that after Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Israel, defence contracts went to Adani; the envoy said: “We have joint ventures with 80 Indian companies which include Tata, Bell, Kalyani... To discuss one company, I don't see the issue here. Joint Ventures are between private companies, they are not pushed by Israel.”

Congress MP Rahul Gandhi had alleged in parliament, “Adani never made drones but HAL, other companies in India do that. Despite that PM Modi goes to Israel and Adani gets the contract.”

In the last six years, Adani group has struck many critical partnerships with companies such as Elbit Systems, Israel Weapon Systems, and Israel Innovation Authority.

Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd in partnership with local chemicals and logistics group Gadot in July last year won an Israel government's tender to buy the Haifa Port, a major trade hub on Israel's Mediterranean coast, for about $1.2 billion.

''The acquisition of the Haifa port also comes with a significant amount of real estate. And I promise you that in the years to come we will transform the skyline we see around us,'' said Adani.

Adani said India-Israel friendship dates back to September 23, 1918, when soldiers from the Indian cities of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur battled in Israel for the freedom of Haifa.","Israel’s envoy to India, Naor Gilon, on Wednesday said the embattled Adani Group had paid in full to acquire Haifa port.

With Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s business empire and practices coming under global scrutiny following accusations that he has been indulging in brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud schemes, South Asian countries where the Adani Group struck deals are calling for revisiting of contracts.

Bangladesh, where Adani Power (Jharkhand) Ltd signed a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) in 2017 has asked for a revision of the contract. “We have communicated with the Indian company seeking revision of the agreement,” an official of the state-run BPDB said.

It was during his visit to Bangladesh in 2015 that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina to “facilitate the entry of Indian companies in the power generation, transmission and distribution sector of Bangladesh.” It culminated in the two sides inking deals worth $4.5 billion for Indian government-run and private companies to sell electricity to Bangladesh. This included a contract for Adani Power to build a $1.7 billion, 1,600-megawatt coal power plant in Godda in India’s eastern state of Jharkhand, which would supply power to Bangladesh.

Modi’s close relationship with Adani is said to have facilitated the building of the coal-fired Godda power plant and the PPA with Bangladesh.

Details of the contract were shrouded in secrecy, but a December 2022 report in the Washington Post threw some light on the agreement.

Under the PPA, Bangladesh will pay $450 million annually for 25 years as capacity and maintenance charges, even if it does not take any electricity from Adani Power Ltd. If Bangladesh wants to use electricity from Adani, it will have to pay an additional amount for coal.

The agreement provides for price fixing of coal by combining the Indonesian and Australian coal prices. Thus, each ton of Adani’s coal would cost Bangladesh around $400. This is 60 percent higher than the usual price of coal, according to BPDB.

It is the Adani Group that comes out as the beneficiary of the deal. Adani’s coal would travel on Adani ships to reach an Adani-owned seaport, and from there an Adani-built railway would haul the coal to Adani’s Godda Power Plant. Finally, the generated electricity would be transmitted from Godda to Bangladesh via Adani-built high-voltage lines.

The PPA passed all associated costs of coal, including shipping and transmission, to Bangladesh. This has made Adani’s electricity over five times more expensive that the market price of bulk electricity in Bangladesh.

Not only was the power from the Adani Group exorbitantly priced, but also this was a purchase that Bangladesh did not need in the first place. Bangladesh’s power-generating capacity exceeds its peak demand by over 40 percent.

The PPA has been sharply criticized in Bangladesh. Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) has described the contract signed by Adani Group and BPDB as “unequal, opaque, and discriminatory.”

“It seems that the agreement has ignored the interests of Bangladesh and favored the interests of Adani Group in such a way that the electricity sector of Bangladesh can become a hostage in the hands of this company,” Dr. Iftekhar Zaman, TIB’s executive director, said.

It may be recalled that in 2021, in response to mounting global concern over the environmental impact of coal-fired power plants and the cheaper cost of renewable energy, Bangladesh canceled ten of 18 planned coal-based power projects. Adani’s project was not among those canceled. According to the Washington Post report, B.D. Rahmatullah, a former director-general of Bangladesh’s power regulator, had observed then that “Hasina cannot afford to anger India, even if the deal appears unfavorable.”

Much has been written about the close relationship between Prime Minister Modi and Adani, and the benefits this has brought to the latter’s business interests, including in Bangladesh.

Although the Indian government did promote Adani Power in the run-up to the PPA, it has distanced itself from the deal with Bangladesh. Responding to questions from the media regarding Bangladesh’s request for revising the agreement, Arindam Bagchi, spokesperson of India’s Ministry of External Affairs, said: “I don’t have anything on that. I understand you are referring to a deal between a sovereign government and an Indian company. I am not aware of it. I don’t even think we are involved in this.”

The Adani Power-BPDB deal could have far-reaching effects. Anti-India sentiment is growing in Bangladesh, where there is anger over anti-Muslim violence in India, New Delhi’s reluctance to finalize an agreement on Teesta River water sharing, blasphemous remarks by BJP leaders, etc. The Adani deal will further fuel this anti-India sentiment.

This deal will also impact the Awami League government. Its proximity to India has earned it criticism from Bangladeshis who believe that India is helping the AL stay in power. Hasina agreed to a lucrative deal for Adani in return for New Delhi’s support to the AL government. The Adani deal stands testimony to the quid pro quo and will further delegitimize AL’s politics in Bangladesh. This is also a serious blow to the government’s development strategies, thereby empowering the opposition’s campaign to pick holes in Hasina’s developmental efforts and strategies.

The high cost of Adani’s electricity will add to rising prices and the cost of living in Bangladesh, which is already reeling under an economic crisis. With the IMF pressuring the government to cut subsidies, survival for the common people will be particularly challenging. As Zaman observed, the “burden” of the PPA “will have to be borne by the people of this country.”","New Delhi has distanced itself from a controversial and unequal deal between Adani Power and the Bangladesh Power Development Board.

A settlement the conglomerate reached with truckers will have only a small impact on the overall Adani empire, but it was a big win for drivers and owners in a state where most people live on around $7 a day.

For truckers transporting cement from Adani's factories in a hilly north Indian state, a U.S. short-seller's critical research report on the giant conglomerate was a godsend they say helped them save their livelihoods.

For weeks, around 7,000 truck owners and drivers in India's Himachal Pradesh resorted to protest rallies against Adani's Dec. 15 decision to shut two cement plants over a dispute on freight rates. Adani argued the plants were ""unviable"" at the trucking rates it wanted to slash by around half.

On Monday, the Gautam Adani-led group said it had ""amicably resolved"" the issue with a 10-12% reduction in rates. Truckers rejoiced, with a union leader in a street address labeling it as a victory after late-night talks with Adani.

The settlement comes four weeks after U.S.-based Hindenburg Research accused Adani of stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens, allegations the group called baseless.

The Jan. 24 report triggered a $140 billion rout in group's stocks, sparked regulatory investigations and saw the billionaire Adani slip to 26 on the Forbes global rich list, from third.

While the truckers' settlement will have only a small impact on the overall Adani empire, it was a big win for the drivers and owners in a state were most people live on around $7 a day.

Since then, Adani’s close ties with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have come under scrutiny, putting Modi in a difficult position. Some of the sharpest criticism has come from hedge fund tycoon and billionaire investor George Soros, who alleged that the Adani debacle would weaken Modi’s grasp on India, paving the way for a “democratic revival.”



Now, a senior government minister has replied to push back on the criticism—and on Soros, as a foreign investor, in particular.



Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar slammed Soros’s remarks at an energy conference in Sydney on Saturday, dismissing his views on the country and the effects of Modi’s curious ties with Adani.



“He is old, rich, opinionated, and dangerous,” Jaishankar said of Soros. “What happens is, when such people and such views and such organizations—they actually invest resources in shaping narratives.”



Soros’s comments about Modi and Adani came at a security conference in Munich last week, where he accused Modi of not being a “democrat” even while being the leader of a democratic country like India. He also talked about how Modi has been tight-lipped about Adani’s meltdown, which could undermine his power at the government level and ultimately lead to “much-needed institutional reform.”



“Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies; their fate is intertwined. Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but he failed,” Soros said.



When asked about Soros’s prediction that Modi’s role would weaken in India, Jaishankar said that people like Soros believed that their definition and views are above everything else, reflecting a typical “Euro-Atlantic view” where Western countries are the dominant powers.



“People like him think an election is good if the person we want to see wins. If the election throws out a different outcome, we actually will say it’s a flawed democracy,” Jaishankar said.



Representatives from India’s Ministry of External Affairs did not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment. George Soros could not be immediately reached for comment.

Not the only one to push back Jaishankar isn’t the only one who pushed back against Soros. The former finance minister of India tweeted that he did not agree with most of what Soros says, in the past and in the current instance of a so-called democratic revival.



Even members of the opposition party in India have rejected the connection between Modi, Adani, and the dawn of institutional reform in India. The general secretary of the Indian National Congress, Jairam Ramesh, tweeted: “Whether the PM-linked Adani scam sparks a democratic revival in India depends entirely on the Congress, Opposition parties & our electoral process. It has NOTHING to do with George Soros. Our Nehruvian legacy ensures people like Soros cannot determine our electoral outcomes.” Whether the PM-linked Adani scam sparks a democratic revival in India depends entirely on the Congress, Opposition parties & our electoral process. It has NOTHING to do with George Soros. Our Nehruvian legacy ensures people like Soros cannot determine our electoral outcomes. — Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) February 17, 2023 The Modi government has maintained its silence on Adani’s meltdown, despite cries at the parliamentary level to investigate Adani Group for its “brazen stock manipulation,” as the Hindenburg report alleged in January. Government ministers have maintained that Adani has “absolutely no connection” with them.

And what is the reason for his optimism? Hear it from him

In 2006, I researched and wrote a paper for the Cato Institute on Gujarat's new strategy of port-based development . This strategy was launched by Congress chief minister Chimanbhai Patel in the early 1990s and expanded by BJP successors. I visited Gautam Adani 's new Mundra port and was struck by its high automation and speed. I was astounded to hear that it financially compensated any ship that was not admitted and unloaded on schedule. While working in Mumbai in 1990, I had seen ships wait 20 days for port entry. So, Mundra seemed to be on another planet.The Hindenburg Research report has alleged vast price rigging and fraud by Adani companies. The charges are serious. Global investors have stampeded out of Adani shares. We need a thorough investigation, and punishment of the guilty.Let me raise a separate linked issue. Adani's critics say he shot to riches not through skills but manipulation and political favours, minting money in cosy monopolies. I disagree. Going from humble origins to global No. 3 in two decades is impossible without exceptional business skills.Critics accuse BJP of 'giving' Adani valuable assets , from ports and mines to airports and transmission lines. No. What the government initially gave Adani was the right to operate a minor port in the Kutch desert without even a rail connection. To convert this desert patch into India's largest port is close to miraculous.Adani has also acquired jetties and ports in a dozen other locations, beating global giants like Maersk and Dubai World in competitive auctions. He is incomparably India's top port operator, handling an estimated quarter of total Indian freight. This makes him a national champion.So, GoI is backing him to acquire strategic jetties and ports in Sri Lanka and Israel. Critics call this a favour. Really? The Sri Lanka terminal will cost $750 million and Haifa Port $1.18 billion. No Indian rival would dare risk so much even if offered on a platter. Adani's skills have made him a strategic player, more than just a businessman.A port is no cosy monopoly. It has to compete in logistics and pricing to woo ships from established rivals. Mundra's logistics have attracted business investments of thousands of crores, creating an industrial hub in the desert. It has the world's largest automated coal-handling facility. A 2017 Morgan Stanley report puts Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) in the top 25% of global port companies.Critics focus on government favours to Adani. In India, business success requires good management of not only factories but politics too. All businessmen cosy up to politicians. But while this opens doors and overcomes some rules, it cannot guarantee success. Anil Ambani is often accused by Rahul Gandhi of getting ₹30,000 crore in defence deals. Yet, he has flopped commercially.Once, Dhirubhai Ambani was also accused of political manipulation and boondoggles. He responded, 'What have I done that every other businessman has not?' There was no reply. Other businessmen, many with formidable historical advantages, had also wooed politicians and fiddled books. For a newcomer like Dhirubhai to beat the old giants at their own game signified immense talent. Something similar can be said of Adani.Dhirubhai's dubious acts are detailed in Hamish McDonald's 1998 book, The Polyester Prince. But critics are dead wrong to think that he was just a successful manipulator. During the licence-permit raj, manipulation was inescapable. But once the economy was liberalised, he built the world's largest export-oriented oil refinery with operating margins higher than even Singapore's famed refineries, proving himself world class. He got favours in telecom but created the cheapest telephone network in the world. Those who focus only on his manipulation are blind to the phenomenal skills that made him a historical titan , warts and all. Adani is treading a similar path.Critics say Adani deals mainly in infrastructure where cosiness to the government matters more than true skills. No. Dozens of new tycoons with strong regional political clout joined the infrastructure boom of 2003-08. But despite having political godfathers, many ran into trouble and went bust, leaving banks with enormous unpaid debts. Success in infrastructure requires skill, not just political friends.Readers may think I am a great Adani fan. But I do not own any Adani company shares because of high prices and high risk. Adani has been diversifying and expanding at breakneck speed using borrowed money, bidding very high prices in auctions and acquisitions. This facilitates fast expansion, but carries great risks. History has examples aplenty of business titans who diversified crazily to create giant conglomerates, succeeded for a few decades amid applause, but eventually came a cropper (like General Electric under Jack Welch).So, I think the Hindenburg report may be the best thing that ever happened to Adani. It will slow his speed of expansion and diversification, and force his financiers to be diligent and cautious in future. This could impose highly desirable financial discipline on Adani, to his own benefit. Hindenburg may have been a blessing in disguise - or, in Winston Churchill's words in response to his wife trying to cheer him up after his post-war electoral defeat, a blessing 'quite effectively disguised'.One day I might actually buy Adani shares.","Swami Speaks: Dhirubhai Ambani had beaten old school business boys, Adani probably better at it The Hindenburg report may be the ""best thing"" that ever happened to billionaire Gautam Adani, says Swaminathan Aiyar.

This is India’s largest green energy company.

This decision was announced by the company management in its post-third quarter results call with its bond holders.

“Short-term capex (12-18 months) is being reviewed. In the near term, there will be a slow down in our target. We will revisit our discretionary capex and reduce our capex in the near term,” the management said in the call with fixed-income investors on February 16, according to the newspaper.

“The capex number that is being talked about is still under review. A larger part of this capacity can be in the form of discretionary capex,” the company also said.

The Adani group and all its companies have been under scrutiny ever since US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of large-scale stock manipulation and accounting fall, leading to a dramatic fall in share values. Last week, Adani Power announced that it would not be going through with its planned purchase of DB Power, even though it had made the winning bid close to a year ago. Adani Road Transport has also said some investment commitments in new road projects are on hold.

SINGAPORE, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Adani Total Private Ltd will receive its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo at the Dhamra terminal on India's east coast in April and expects to start commercial operations 30 to 45 days after receiving the shipment, the Adani Group told Reuters.

The start-up of the 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) LNG import terminal, delayed from September 2021, is crucial to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to boost natural gas use in the country's energy mix to 15% from about 6% currently.

The Adani Group's first LNG import terminal will boost gas use in India's east, where the Dhamra project is only the second import terminal. The country's five other import terminals are on its western coast.

Adani Total, in which French energy giant TotalEnergies SE (TTEF.PA) has a 50% stake, said the Dhamra terminal expected safety checks and testing to be completed in February, adding that all key regulatory approvals have been achieved.

""The port infrastructure at Dhamra is ready to receive LNG cargoes at the Terminal per the contractual specifications,"" an Adani Group spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions late on Thursday.

India's imports fell for a second consecutive year in 2022 after rising for seven years, data from analytics firm Kpler showed, with its appetite curbed by high prices due to Europe's scramble for gas to replace supply from Russia.

However in January, as Asian LNG prices cooled, imports rose for the first time in eight months, government data showed. Officials expect expanded local gas distribution to drive LNG demand in the coming years.

Adani Total expects to receive 2.2 million tonnes of LNG at Dhamra in the year to March 2024, the company's chief executive told Reuters this month.

It has a 20-year take-or-pay contract to provide regasification services to state-run Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) for 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG and 1.5 mtpa for government-run gas distributor GAIL (India) Ltd (GAIL.NS).

UK overtakes India as world’s sixth-biggest equity market after 9 months, says report","The UK has surpassed India as the world’s sixth-largest equity market for the first time since May 2022 as a weaker pound boosts appeal of exporters and jitters over Adani-Hindenburg row are being felt across Indian markets, said a report on Wednesday.

The combined market capitalisation of primary listings in the UK, excluding ETFs and ADRs, reached about $3.11 trillion on Tuesday, $5.1 billion higher than their Indian equivalents, which hasn’t happened since May 29, 2022, said Bloomberg.

UK’s FTSE 350 Index — which comprises stocks in the FTSE 100 and the domestically focused FTSE 250 — has gained 5.9% so far this year. Meanwhile, Nifty 50 has fallen 3.5% so far in 2023.

India’s equity market is facing a double whammy of a weaker rupee and the massive fallout of the stock rout being witnessed by Adani Group firms ever since US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research released a scathing report against the conglomerate.

The January 24 report by Hindenburg Research alleged the conglomerate improperly used offshore tax havens and manipulated stocks, which the conglomerate denied. The report also flagged concerns over its high debt levels. The listed Adani stocks lost a combined market capitalisation of over whopping $140 billion due to the damning report by Hindenburg.

Adani has repeatedly denied the claims and has also cut expenses and repaid debt as he seeks to calm traders concerned about the group’s access to financing.

BSE's m-cap stood at Rs 261 lakh crore on Wednesday, after losing over 4% m-cap to Adani stock rout since late January.

“The negative Adani headlines have caused some concerns among international investors, but they’re mainly focused on the group,” Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at Zurich-based GAM Investments told Bloomberg. “This could cause investors to be more selective in India, but we are not seeing investors avoiding Indian stocks in general.”

Benchmark Sensex tanked 927 points while the broader Nifty settled at a four-month low on Wednesday due to an intense selling in heavyweight stocks triggered by geopolitical and inflation concerns.

Losses in global equities and across-the-board selling ahead of the monthly expiry of derivatives also hit the investor sentiment, dragging down the key indices for a fourth straight day.

The BSE Sensex tumbled 927.74 points or 1.53 per cent to settle at 59,744.98, the lowest closing level since February 1. As many as 29 of the Sensex stocks declined. During the day, it tanked 991.17 points or 1.63 per cent to 59,681.55.

The 50-issue NSE Nifty declined 272.40 points or 1.53 per cent to end at a four-month low of 17,554.30 with 47 of its constituents ending in the red.

Will it...",None,"Adani, Rafale, Pegasus and the Question of What Concerns the Indian Voter","Last week, a Congress spokesperson asked me whether the Adani issue would matter at all to the ordinary voter. Clearly, he had some self-doubt as to how the campaign against Gautam Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would play out politically and electorally.

Will it affect Modi’s popularity?

Sections of the Congress party may be grappling with this question, especially after Rahul Gandhi upped the ante dramatically with his captivating speech in the Lok Sabha on the unique relationship between Gautam Adani and PM Modi. A large part of the speech stands expunged, showing that the issue is troubling Modi. But Modi has also shown the capacity to repeatedly emerge politically unscathed, and this causes self-doubt in the opposition camp.

On an earlier occasion, similar self-doubts were expressed by sections of the Congress when Rahul Gandhi had relentlessly campaigned against Modi’s handling of the Rafale deal. Even then, some opposition leaders felt that Modi was seen as personally incorruptible, so simply attacking him with corruption charges would not help. The same logic was used when the Pegasus issue exploded in parliament and a whole session was nearly washed out. How will the Pegasus issue impact the voter in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or Rajasthan?

So the larger question is as follows ― should the opposition choose issues for political campaigning based purely on how they would play out electorally and how much they would impact Modi’s image? If this is the dominant consideration for doing opposition politics then it would be severely self-limiting, and even self-defeating.

Politics cannot work on such a narrow and instrumental basis.

True, Modi has a certain teflon quality, something they used to say about Atal Bihari Vajpayee, too. Many corruption scams in Vajpayee’s time did not stick to him personally. But that did not dissuade the Opposition from campaigning on those issues. Of course Vajpayee’s government was less centralised, which helped the Prime Minister’s Office to deflect the blame to coalition partners. It was then widely believed that Pramod Mahajan was the party’s chief fund collector and Vajpayee’s policy was to keep some distance from those activities.

But nothing is static in politics. Vajpayee did lose power in spite of retaining much of his aura of personal incorruptibility. So the opposition would do well not to get intimidated by what seems like Modi’s impenetrable teflon image. More importantly, it is the opposition’s dharma to campaign around issues without always weighing the outcome in terms of electoral dividends. In politics, outcomes generally don’t build up in a linear fashion. A lot of things accumulate in the electorate’s deeper consciousness before manifesting all at once.

So every issue which rightfully deserves intense campaigning must be taken up, irrespective of immediate electoral gains. Rafale was a big issue because it was apparent that all established procedures for defence procurement sanctified by the cabinet and the President of India were upended overnight. Corruption is not just about taking bribes. It is also about how established institutions are deliberately weakened and destroyed.

On Modi’s policy to actively help in the expansion of big business entities, the issue is not whether he has personally benefited from his close links with such businesses. It is more about how such a nexus with big business impacts democracy and key democratic institutions.

The opposition needs to properly nuance its messaging by suggesting that one need not be personally financially corrupt to perpetuate oneself in power by cornering over 85% of all big business funding in favour of one party. The people who vote and care for India’s democracy will eventually understand this logic. It is therefore not all about whether a leader is amassing personal wealth or not.

It seems like a no-brainer that the campaign around Modi’s nexus with big business has to be directly linked to the opaque manner in which electoral bonds are funding Indian politics. Hopefully, at some stage, the voter will clearly understand what is at stake. It would be meaningless for the opposition to sit back and speculate how quickly the voter might respond to such campaigns. The opposition must do what is right. It is as simple as that.","Last week, a Congress spokesperson asked me whether the Adani issue would matter at all to the ordinary voter.

A Bloomberg report has claimed that Sebi is examining both parties' (Hindenburg and Adani Group) accusations, but has not yet found any irregularities in the documents. Sebi, however, hasn’t issued any official statement on its investigation yet.

The report said that Sebi is closely inspecting the Adani Group's listed firms, their functioning, and trading of shares. But the market regulator has clarified that its actions should not be construed as a formal investigation.

On February 13, Sebi told the Supreme Court that it is “enquiring” into the allegations made by American short seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group of companies and its impact on the markets. Sebi said it was looking into the market activities of the whole group “preceding and post the publication of the report”, to detect if there were violations of its regulations.

The Hindenburg report, which went public on January 24, accused the Adani Group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud for decades”. It further said that the Indian conglomerate was involved in stock manipulation and fraud using shell companies. In its report, the short seller said that key listed Adani companies have taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their ""inflated stock"" for loans, putting the entire group ""on precarious financial footing"".

The report triggered a massive selloff of Adani Group stocks. The group’s market capitalisation has slipped below Rs 7 lakh crore by the end of Monday. The group’s market capitalisation eroded by another Rs 34,000 crore on Monday, taking the total market capitalisation erosion to 64 per cent or about Rs 12.37 lakh crore since the release of the Hindenburg Research report.

Flagship Adani Enterprises’ market capitalisation (mcap) stood at Rs 1.36 lakh crore, as of Monday, 65 per cent below the value of Rs 3.92 lakh crore on January 24. Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission have shed more than three-fourths of their value since January 24.

On Tuesday, many Adani Group stocks made a strong rebound after it was reported that the embattled group was planning to prepay or repay share-backed loans worth $690 million to $790 million by March end.

Despite the massive bloodbath in the market, S&P Global last week affirmed its rating on Adani Green Energy at 'BB+' with a stable outlook. The American credit rating agency has removed the company from under-criteria observation.

S&P said it expects the company's restricted group to help meet repayment obligations due to its strong reserving mechanism.

Adani Green's restricted group 2 includes three entities namely Wardha Solar (Maharashtra), Kodangal Solar Park, and Adani Renewable Energy (RJ).

On December 14 last year, the agency published its revised criteria for rating project finance transactions and placed Adani Green Energy Ltd under criteria observation. The agency on Friday said it has completed its review of AGEL RG2 and ""believes the revised criteria does not impact our assessment of the project's creditworthiness"".

Last week, even Fitch Ratings affirmed the 'BBB-' ratings on the $400-million senior secured notes issued by Adani Transmission Ltd. The outlook of the embattled Adani Group company is stable, the rating agency said.

Adani Transmission's RG1 includes six co-issuers - Barmer Power Transmission Service Limited, Chhattisgarh-WR Transmission, Hadoti Power Transmission Service, Raipur-Rajnandgaon-Warora Transmission, Sipat Transmission Limited, and Thar Power Transmission Service - and one non-issuing SPV, Adani Transmission (Rajasthan) Ltd (ATRL).

Fitch in its statement said that ATL RG1's credit assessment is not directly affected by the alleged malpractices at India's Adani group highlighted in Hindenburg Research's report due to the ringfenced nature of these assets. The offshore bondholders benefit from a robust cash flow waterfall mechanism and covenants that restrict cash upstreaming to shareholders and limit indebtedness. Moreover, ATL RG1 has a 30-year largely amortizing bond.

However, the valuation guru also said that it shows bad business practice and not con as alleged in the US-based short seller Hindenburg report.

“The Adani Group collectively carries about three times as much debt as it should, confirming that the group is over-levered, but note that this is bad business practice, not a con,"" Damodaran said.

Damodaran argued that the cost of capital shows that there is little, if any, benefit in terms of value added to Adani from using debt, and significant downside risk unless the debt is being subsidized by someone (government, sloppy bankers, green bondholders).

On Adani Group's flagship company, Damodaran said, ""Adani Enterprise carries too much debt, with an actual debt of 413,443 million more than double its optimal debt of 185,309 million, and reducing its debt load will not just lower its risk of failure, but also lower its cost of capital.""

This company, the professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business said, is part of a family group, where higher debt at one of the Adani companies may be offset by less debt at another.

Meanwhile, Adani Group said that it plans to prepay or repay share-backed loans worth $690 million to $790 million by March-end, Reuters reported.

The plan comes even as the group holds a fixed-income roadshow this week in Singapore and Hong Kong to shore up investor confidence amid share price falls and a regulatory probe.

Adani Green Energy Ltd also plans to refinance its 2024 bonds via an $800 million, three-year credit line.

The group presented both plans to bondholders in Hong Kong on Tuesday, the people said. The three-day roadshow is scheduled to end on Wednesday.

Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh told Bloomberg News the group is not looking to refinance debt or raise capital.

Seven listed Adani group companies have lost more than $140 billion in market value since a 24 January report by Hindenburg Research alleged stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens, and flagged concerns over debt levels.

Adani has rejected the allegations and denied wrongdoing.

The conglomerate backed by billionaire Gautam Adani is in talks with global credit funds after Adani's $236 billion infrastructure empire shrunk by more than three-fifths in a month.

Controlled by the Adani family trust, North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT) is being considered to raise funds for the group, according to the report.

Adani has begun discussions with multiple large high-yield global credit funds, and has so far received two indicative term sheets from potential lenders which include hedge fund Farallon Capital, the report said.

Australia's corporate regulator said it would review a short-seller report that had flagged a wide range of concerns about the Adani Group, according to a recent Reuters report.

In Australia, Adani operates the Carmichael coal mine and a related rail line, the North Queensland Export Terminal, which is a major port for Queensland coal exports, as well as a solar farm.

Meanwhile, the Adani Group is kicking off a charm offensive with fixed-income investors in Asia from today in a bid to win back debt investors' faith post the fallout from US-based shortseller Hindenburg Research's allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

Nearly a dozen global banks will help host the investor meetings at Singapore's Capitol Kempinski hotel today. The group will then hold meetings in Hong Kong at the Barclays Plc office tomorrow and on Wednesday. Due to attend are group chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh and corporate finance head Anupam Misra.

On Monday, all stocks of the Adani group, except Adani Ports, are trading in red. Adani Green has hit 5 per cent lower circuit.

A Bloomberg report has claimed that Sebi is examining both parties' (Hindenburg and Adani Group) accusations, but has not yet found any irregularities in the documents. Sebi, however, hasn’t issued any official statement on its investigation yet.

The report said that Sebi is closely inspecting the Adani Group's listed firms, their functioning, and trading of shares. But the market regulator has clarified that its actions should not be construed as a formal investigation.

On February 13, Sebi told the Supreme Court that it is “enquiring” into the allegations made by American short seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group of companies and its impact on the markets. Sebi said it was looking into the market activities of the whole group “preceding and post the publication of the report”, to detect if there were violations of its regulations.

The Hindenburg report, which went public on January 24, accused the Adani Group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud for decades”. It further said that the Indian conglomerate was involved in stock manipulation and fraud using shell companies. In its report, the short seller said that key listed Adani companies have taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their ""inflated stock"" for loans, putting the entire group ""on precarious financial footing"".

The report triggered a massive selloff of Adani Group stocks. The group’s market capitalisation has slipped below Rs 7 lakh crore by the end of Monday. The group’s market capitalisation eroded by another Rs 34,000 crore on Monday, taking the total market capitalisation erosion to 64 per cent or about Rs 12.37 lakh crore since the release of the Hindenburg Research report.

Flagship Adani Enterprises’ market capitalisation (mcap) stood at Rs 1.36 lakh crore, as of Monday, 65 per cent below the value of Rs 3.92 lakh crore on January 24. Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission have shed more than three-fourths of their value since January 24.

On Tuesday, many Adani Group stocks made a strong rebound after it was reported that the embattled group was planning to prepay or repay share-backed loans worth $690 million to $790 million by March end.

Despite the massive bloodbath in the market, S&P Global last week affirmed its rating on Adani Green Energy at 'BB+' with a stable outlook. The American credit rating agency has removed the company from under-criteria observation.

S&P said it expects the company's restricted group to help meet repayment obligations due to its strong reserving mechanism.

Adani Green's restricted group 2 includes three entities namely Wardha Solar (Maharashtra), Kodangal Solar Park, and Adani Renewable Energy (RJ).

On December 14 last year, the agency published its revised criteria for rating project finance transactions and placed Adani Green Energy Ltd under criteria observation. The agency on Friday said it has completed its review of AGEL RG2 and ""believes the revised criteria does not impact our assessment of the project's creditworthiness"".

Last week, even Fitch Ratings affirmed the 'BBB-' ratings on the $400-million senior secured notes issued by Adani Transmission Ltd. The outlook of the embattled Adani Group company is stable, the rating agency said.

Adani Transmission's RG1 includes six co-issuers - Barmer Power Transmission Service Limited, Chhattisgarh-WR Transmission, Hadoti Power Transmission Service, Raipur-Rajnandgaon-Warora Transmission, Sipat Transmission Limited, and Thar Power Transmission Service - and one non-issuing SPV, Adani Transmission (Rajasthan) Ltd (ATRL).

Fitch in its statement said that ATL RG1's credit assessment is not directly affected by the alleged malpractices at India's Adani group highlighted in Hindenburg Research's report due to the ringfenced nature of these assets. The offshore bondholders benefit from a robust cash flow waterfall mechanism and covenants that restrict cash upstreaming to shareholders and limit indebtedness. Moreover, ATL RG1 has a 30-year largely amortizing bond.

However, the valuation guru also said that it shows bad business practice and not con as alleged in the US-based short seller Hindenburg report.

“The Adani Group collectively carries about three times as much debt as it should, confirming that the group is over-levered, but note that this is bad business practice, not a con,"" Damodaran said.

Damodaran argued that the cost of capital shows that there is little, if any, benefit in terms of value added to Adani from using debt, and significant downside risk unless the debt is being subsidized by someone (government, sloppy bankers, green bondholders).

On Adani Group's flagship company, Damodaran said, ""Adani Enterprise carries too much debt, with an actual debt of 413,443 million more than double its optimal debt of 185,309 million, and reducing its debt load will not just lower its risk of failure, but also lower its cost of capital.""

This company, the professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business said, is part of a family group, where higher debt at one of the Adani companies may be offset by less debt at another.

Meanwhile, Adani Group said that it plans to prepay or repay share-backed loans worth $690 million to $790 million by March-end, Reuters reported.

The plan comes even as the group holds a fixed-income roadshow this week in Singapore and Hong Kong to shore up investor confidence amid share price falls and a regulatory probe.

Adani Green Energy Ltd also plans to refinance its 2024 bonds via an $800 million, three-year credit line.

The group presented both plans to bondholders in Hong Kong on Tuesday, the people said. The three-day roadshow is scheduled to end on Wednesday.

Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh told Bloomberg News the group is not looking to refinance debt or raise capital.

Seven listed Adani group companies have lost more than $140 billion in market value since a 24 January report by Hindenburg Research alleged stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens, and flagged concerns over debt levels.

Adani has rejected the allegations and denied wrongdoing.

Shares of flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd were up over 8% in Tuesday's trade, whereas Adani Green Energy was up 3.75%.","The Adani Group carries three times as much debt as it should, Aswath Damodaran, whose work has been widely published in leading finance journals, said in his blog post.
“The Adani Group collectively carries about three times as much debt as it should, confirming that the group is over-levered, but note that this is bad business practice, not a con,"" Damodaran said.

Selling pressure in select index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries and Infosys also dragged the indices lower.

The conglomerate backed by billionaire Gautam Adani is in talks with global credit funds after Adani's $236 billion infrastructure empire shrunk by more than three-fifths in a month.

Controlled by the Adani family trust, North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT) is being considered to raise funds for the group, according to the report.

Adani has begun discussions with multiple large high-yield global credit funds, and has so far received two indicative term sheets from potential lenders which include hedge fund Farallon Capital, the report said.

Australia's corporate regulator said it would review a short-seller report that had flagged a wide range of concerns about the Adani Group, according to a recent Reuters report.

In Australia, Adani operates the Carmichael coal mine and a related rail line, the North Queensland Export Terminal, which is a major port for Queensland coal exports, as well as a solar farm.

Meanwhile, the Adani Group is kicking off a charm offensive with fixed-income investors in Asia from today in a bid to win back debt investors' faith post the fallout from US-based shortseller Hindenburg Research's allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

Nearly a dozen global banks will help host the investor meetings at Singapore's Capitol Kempinski hotel today. The group will then hold meetings in Hong Kong at the Barclays Plc office tomorrow and on Wednesday. Due to attend are group chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh and corporate finance head Anupam Misra.

On Monday, all stocks of the Adani group, except Adani Ports, are trading in red. Adani Green has hit 5 per cent lower circuit.

Venugopal states: ""The recent Hindenburg report has exposed Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi and the BJP government's policy of crony capitalism in favour of Adani . At a time of deep economic distress, PM Modi has been selling the nation's critical infrastructure to Adani group, bending India's foreign policy and forcing public institutions like SBI and LIC to invest in Adani group.

The Central government led by Narendra Modi is handing over the country’s wealth to the Adani Group, in the same way that the British East India Company had taken it away from India, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said while addressing his party’s 85th plenary session on Sunday.

Warning that ‘history is repeating itself’, Mr. Gandhi said that “Modi ji and Adani ji are one” and that was why the Opposition was not allowed to ask questions about business tycoon Gautam Adani in Parliament. He then asserted that he would continue to ask question about Mr. Adani until the truth came out.

The former Congress chief also urged the party leadership to formulate a new plan to carry forward the “ tapasya (penance)“ undertaken through the Bharat Jodo Yatra, indicating that another yatra could be on the cards, along the east-west route this time.

Kashmiri impact

Mr. Gandhi’s focus in the 50-minute-long speech, addressing 17,000-odd delegates, was divided between the Bharat Jodo Yatra (BJY) and the Adani group.

Talking about the Jammu & Kashmir leg of the BJY, the Congress leader said that the yatra had made Kashmiri youth carry the national flag, even in terrorism-infested districts like Pulwama and Anantnag.

“I heard the Prime Minister say in Parliament that he had also hoisted the national flag in Lal Chowk. India’s Prime Minister didn’t understand the difference. Narendra Modi ji along with 15-20 BJP people hoisted the flag. Bharat Jodo Yatra made lakhs of Kashmiri youth hoist the tricolour,” he said.

‘Cowardice’

Mr Gandhi also took on the BJP’s nationalism plank by referring to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s recent statement that as China was a big economy, it was common sense not to pick a fight with it.

“When the British ruled us, was their economy smaller than ours? Do you not fight if someone is stronger than you? There is a word for this: cowardice. This is [Vinayak Damodar] Savarkar’s ideology, to bow down before the powerful. An Indian Minister is telling China, ‘your economy is bigger and we can’t fight with you’. Do you call this nationalism? What kind of patriotism is this?” he asked.

In the second half of his speech, the Congress leader made a focussed attack on the Adani group and its relations with Mr. Modi and his government.

The Adani connection

“When we asked in Parliament, ‘what is the Prime Minister’s relation with Adani’, our entire speech is expunged. [Mallikarjun] Kharge ji’s entire speech was expunged. We will ask in Parliament thousands of times till the truth of Adani ji is out, we will not stop,” Mr. Gandhi said, amid applause.

Repeating many of the points that he had raised in the Lok Sabha, the Congress leader questioned how Mr. Adani rose from the 609th to the second spot on the global billionaires list; asked how India’s foreign policy helped the Adani Group in countries like Israel, Australia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh; and expressed concerns about alleged shell companies, especially given the Adani Group’s involvement in the defence sector and other key sectors like airports, ports, agriculture and agricultural storage.

He also questioned why several Union Ministers had to come to the defence of one businessman. “I had asked a simple question on Modi ji and Adani ji’s relationship . The simple answer could have been ‘there is no relation’. But there is a relation. Adani ji and Modi are one,” Mr. Gandhi said.

“I want to tell the people who work for Adani ji’s company that their company is hurting the country and it is snatching the entire infrastructure of country,” Mr. Gandhi said. “Remember that the freedom struggle started against the East India Company and that too was a company. History is being repeated. This is against the country and if that happens, the entire Congress party will stand against it,” he added.

After Mr. Gandhi’s all-out attack on the Adani Group, Congress general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal announced that the party would undertake a series of programmes to “expose the Modi government’s link with the corporate group”.","Warning that ‘history is repeating itself’, Mr. Gandhi said that “Modi ji and Adani ji are one” and that was why the Opposition was not allowed to ask questions about business tycoon Gautam Adani in Parliament.

Adani Ports and SEZ (APSEZ), which has 13 ports across India with >600 million tonnes (mnt) total capacity, has demonstrated its ability to successfully construct /acquire assets in India and create significant value for stakeholders, said JM Financial in a report.

The share price of Adani Ports closed at ₹590 on February 28 as compared to the previous close of ₹562 - up 5%. The stock opened at ₹562.05, hit an intraday high of ₹614.60 and intraday low of ₹552.

Meanwhile, Jefferies also has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of ₹800 in a base case scenario. The brokerage expects the company's consolidated volume CAGR over FY22-25E to come in at 14%; 13x EV/EBITDA Sept'24E. The gradual monetization of SEZ is also expected over 20 years.

“On the back of aggressive expansion in logistics (container/bulk/ warehousing), APSEZ is transforming into India’s largest integrated transport utility, providing end-to-end logistics solutions to its enormous customer base,"" the JM Financial report said.

“Mundra's market share gain success story should be replicated across the acquired ports. Material inter-corporate deposits should not be seen in the medium term. Working capital and operating leverage should continue to improve P&L growth and balance sheet strength,"" said Jefferies report.

APSEZ has delivered supreme market share gains in India in the past decade (10ppt+ in overall share; 16ppt+ in container cargo) and is expected to sustain that in future with organic and inorganic growth, said JM Financial.

On January 25, Hindenburg Research posted a report alleging Adani of fraud and said that it holds short positions in the company stocks. The 10 stocks from the group have been very volatile since then. The company has taken many steps to fight out the research firm, and soothe the investors.

India's largest insurer LIC has also seen a significant impact for its large exposure towards Adani firms. The insurer's stock has taken a massive blow since the Hindenburg accused Gautam Adani and his port-to-energy empire of stock manipulation and frauds. In a month, the LIC stock has nosedived by nearly 17% on Dalal Street and its shareholding value in Adani stocks has declined by more than ₹48,600 crore.

As per BSE data, LIC held 4,81,74,654 equity shares, or 4.23%, in the group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises as on December 31, 2022. The government-owned life insurer held 4,06,76,207 equity shares, or 3.65% stake, in Adani Transmission during the same quarter; 6,55,88,170 equity shares, or 5.96%, in Adani Total Gas; and 2,03,09,080 equity shares or 1.28% in Adani Green Energy.

LIC also has some exposure to Adani's cement business. The insurer holds 12,55,89,263 equity shares or 6.33% in Ambuja Cements and 1,20,33,271 equity shares or 6.41% in ACC.

But LIC's largest holding in Adani-related stocks are in Adani Ports. The insurer has 19,75,26,194 equity shares or 9.14% in Adani Ports.

LIC does not have any holding in Adani Wilmar, Adani Power, and NDTV.

The data is from BSE and as of December 31, 2022.

Taking into consideration, the market price of Adani stocks on January 24th, LIC's shareholding in Adani Enterprises was valued at around ₹16585.33 crore; in Adani Ports it was around ₹15,028.78 crore; in Adani Transmission it was ₹11,210.97 crore; in Adani Total Gas it was ₹25,483.96 crore; and in Adani Green Energy it was ₹3,886.24 crore.

While in Ambuja Cements, LIC's holding valued at around ₹6,261.25 crore, and in ACC around ₹2,811.21 crore.

In total, LIC's shareholding in Adani stocks as of January 24 was around ₹81,267.75 crore.

But on the same day, things were about to change drastically for Adani's conglomerate and many would be left baffled. On January 24th, Hindenburg dropped a critical report, alleging that Gautam Adani's group has committed fraud, stock manipulation, and tax evasion among others.

Hindenburg's January 24th report said, ""we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the ₹17.8 trillion (U.S. $218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.""

The short seller had claimed that the 7 Adani named stocks are more than 85% overvalued.

And then began a series of free falls in Adani stocks. A month later, the panic selling still continues in Adani shares. By end of February 24th, Adani Group's market value together has slipped by over ₹12 lakh crore in a month.

Before January 24th, Adani stocks together held the alpha seat on stock exchanges with a market valuation of over ₹19 lakh crore, surpassing Mukesh Ambani's Reliance and Ratan Tata's TCS.

Why LIC was impacted by the Adani-Hindenburg row? The answer is simple it is because of the exposure LIC has in Adani stocks. Although on January 30th, LIC had stated it has ₹35,917 crore under equity and debt at the end of December in Adani Group stocks. LIC had said, the total purchase value of equity under all Adani group companies is ₹30,127 crore.

By end of February 24th, LIC's shareholding value in Adani stocks was around ₹32,618.56 crore. Hence, in total, the shareholding value of LIC in Adani stocks declined by ₹48,649.17 crore from January 24 to February 24th.

Following the business update, the scrip rose 2.32 per cent to Rs 571.95.

In a filing to BSE, Adani Ports said it has registered unprecedented growth since it started operations over two decades ago and continues to outperform all India cargo volume growth, with its market share rising rapidly.

CEO and Whole Time Director Karan Adani said: ""The APSEZ’s flagship port, Mundra, is outpacing all its closest rivals by comfortable margins and continues to be the largest port in the nation in terms of volumes handled.”

The Adani group company said increase in cargo volume handled at its ports is a sign that the nation’s economy is picking up. Almost 95 per cent of the trade volumes in India are carried through maritime transport, it noted.

""Having world-class mega ports is imperative for the Indian coastline. Through concession agreements with various government authorities, APSEZ has strategically built a string of ports (pearls) across the coastline of India along with ICDs (inland container depots) and warehouses, woven intricately with self-owned rakes, covering more than 70 per cent of the hinterland,"" Adani Ports said.

Adani Ports said it has seen 4 per cent YoY growth at its container terminals because of its efficient infrastructure.

""The engagement with container lines and the resolve to deliver on commitments has led to more new services at APSEZ terminals, raising volumes.

Adani Ports said the ongoing year has seen growth in agri exports due to India’s record high food grain production and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

""Mundra Port registered a record RO-RO exports – an increase of 18 per cent largely due to long-time customer, Maruti Suzuki India. Hazira has been continuously witnessing sustained growth in chemical volumes YoY due to its proximity to the chemical hub of India. It has seen a 16 per cent growth this year,"" Adani Ports said.

He doesn’t see any loss of confidence in India, consequent to the Adani-Hindenburg issue. This is because the external world now recognises that India has its own regulatory checks and balances, which will keep things in check.

The developments come at a time when the Adani Group's stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share price manipulation, against it. The group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

The rout in Adani Group shares, which has wiped out over Rs 12 lakh crore of investor wealth over the last one month has taken the group’s market capitalisation below Rs 7 lakh crore. Market capitalisation worth another Rs 26,000 crore was lost in Monday's trading session.

Decline in the group's shares has also narrowed its dominance on the Indian bourses as the group’s market capitalisation as a percentage of combined BSE market capitalisation slid below three percent for the first time in the last two years.","In an exclusive interaction with CNBC-TV18, KV Kamath refused to particularly talk about the Adani Group fiasco but said ‘no single group carves out destiny of the nation.’KV Kamath, former ICICI Bank Chief, on February 27 said, there is no crisis of confidence in India and that no single group carves out the destiny of the nation.

The retail slowdown has also translated into the net inflows into domestic mutual funds as December quarter had only seen 15% of the full year’s equity subscription (net) inflows. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), on the other hand, retained their buying momentum with net purchases of $5.8 bn, as per the report.

What are investors buying and selling?

The global brokerage used quarterly company disclosures to track transactions by individual, mutual fund and FII investors. Quarterly data also analysed stock level analysis by investor class.

Top stock buys of Retail investors: Bajaj Finance, Adani Ports, Tata Elxsi, Bharti Airtel, and Wipro.

Top sells of Retail: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Hindalco, Tata Steel, Infosys, TCS. Retail investors had been a steady buyer of Indian IT stocks for several quarters; which seems to have now turned.

For 4Q CY22, there has been some synchronicity in the stock buying of domestic mutual funds and selling by individual investors/FIIs, as per the report.

Mutual Funds bought HDFC Bank, HDFC, RIL and Tata Steel which was sold by retail. Similarly, mutual funds bought Maruti, Bajaj Finance, and IndusInd Bank which was sold by FIIs. Similar buy/sell pairs also emerged for FIIs and individuals/mutual funds, where FIIs bought Axis Bank (sold by MFs), L&T (sold by retail), HCL Tech (sold by retail).

It is also noteworthy that while India had kept in step with regional EM peers with respect to foreign flows, January was an outlier where India has seen significant selling against buying in the region.

“SIP flows remain resilient, but the rest of retail flow into markets seems to be slowing. Trailing market returns are meagre even as fixed income rates are moving up – there is little reason for individual investors to come back to the market near term, we think. This can hurt mid-cap valuations,"" JPMorgan added.","Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), on the other hand, retained their buying momentum with net purchases of $5.8 bn, as per the report.

The stock slumped 5 per cent to settle at its lower circuit level of Rs 344.20 over a previous close of Rs 362.30. The counter has declined 21.41 per cent in six days. At today's closing price of Rs 344.20, the scrip is just 2 per cent shy away from its 52-week low of Rs 337.45, hit on March 7 last year.

That said, the counter has lost 43.02 per cent on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Since January 24 this year, Adani stocks took a major hit after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research alleged that the Gautam Adani-led Indian conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the last few decades. Adani Group, however, refuted the claim as baseless. Following a brief halt, the Adani stock rout resumed last week.

The scrip had scaled its 52-week high of Rs 878.35 on April 28, 2022. However, it needs to be pointed out that barely a month back that year, the share price of Adani Wilmar was at its one-year low. In other words, the stock had swung by a whopping 160.29 per cent higher from its respective 52-week low and high levels.

On the earnings front, the edible oil major reported a 16 per cent increase in its consolidated profit to Rs 246.11 crore for the third quarter that ended December 2022 against Rs 211.41 crore in the year-ago period.

Ravi Singh, Vice-President and Head of Research at Share India, said, ""Adani Wilmar's stock is under freeze due to continuous selling in the counter. It could witness some more selling pressure amid an overall weakness in the Adani Group. In the current scenario, the stock may touch Rs 310 in the near term.""

AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades said, ""Adani Wilmar looks bearish and a close below daily support of Rs 360 could lead to a target of Rs 272 in the near term. Strong resistance will be at Rs 387.""

The stock traded lower than 5-day, 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. The counter's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) came at 27.83. A level below 30 is defined as oversold while a value above 70 is considered overbought. The company's stock has a negative price-to-equity (P/E) ratio of 64.27.

Yet, Adani Wilmar has an average target price of Rs 637.67, Trendlyne data showed, suggesting a potential upside of 85.13 per cent. The scrip has a one-year beta of 1.12, indicating high volatility.

Meanwhile, Indian equity benchmarks traded lower today, extending their losing run for the seventh straight session. The domestic indices were dragged by metals, technology and automobile stocks.

It’s the best-performing stock in the NSE Nifty 50 Index with a 15% gain this year, pushing its market value to nearly $57 billion. Its climb has accelerated this month, as US short seller Hindenburg Research’s allegations against the Adani Group has made Adani Enterprises Ltd. and Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd. the index’s worst performers.

“ITC’s stable cash flow and dividends have won hearts of investors in this volatile environment amid Adani’s troubles and inflation,"" said Sameer Kalra, founder of Target Investing in Mumbai. “The company is also expected to unlock value its non-cigarette businesses.""

ITC — whose operations range from tobacco to food and hotels — has one of the highest dividend yields and returns-on-equity among Nifty members. It also ranks top in a Bloomberg Economics analysis of governance, liquidity and leverage at Indian conglomerates. Tech Mahindra Ltd., a software services provider with similar characteristics to ITC, is the Nifty’s second-best gainer year to date.

India investors are increasingly drawn to stable returns. Dividend yield has been the top-performing strategy for a long-short portfolio of the nation’s blue chips this year, while price-target changes and earnings revisions rank top over 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Amid this search for stability, ITC’s gains have been pronounced, driving the stock up more than 75% in the past year. The surge in investor attention marks a big change with a couple years ago, when social-media memes lampooned the company’s stock as boring after years of stagnation and scrutiny of global tobacco businesses.

ITC has gotten a further boost from stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings due to better performance in its cigarette business and a recovery in its hotels segment.","Shares of Indian conglomerate ITC Ltd. have climbed to a record high, demonstrating investors may be starting to focus on stability in a market churning with concerns over corporate governance.

These stocks are too volatile and will move more on news flow rather than valuation drivers and technical parameters,” said Rahul Ghose, Founder & CEO – Hedged.Nifty lost 2% in the Feb expiry series. What are the key levels to watch out for in the March series?Nifty is in a sideways trend with the upper-end of the range being at the 18,220 level and the lower-end of the range at its 200-day SMA at 17,350. Once Nifty breaks this level of 17,350, the trend will become sideways-to-bearish from just sideways.Once the level of 16,740 gets taken out by a bearish closing, the trend changes to a confirmed downtrend. It is important to note that the 16,740 level is important because there is a demand zone on the index up to 16,740 and also the fact that the Elder ray signals right now do not completely write-off this sideways movement.Whether Bank Nifty will continue its underperformance in the March series or not depends on two factors: There are a large number of Put writers at the 40,000 level as per open interest (OI) data. It is interesting to note that these put writers did not cover their positions even when Bank Nifty dipped below the 40,000 mark. If Bank Nifty breaks this level decisively then these put writers will have to run for cover propelling Bank Nifty’s underperformance.Secondly, Bank Nifty is forming a positive divergence on the charts with the momentum indicators. The following week will decide if these materialize or not. If it fails to materialize, it will contribute towards the underperformance. Also, it is important to note that there is a large caution formed on the Bank Nifty monthly time-frame. This as on date shows large bearishness. The level to watch out for Bank Nifty on the downside is 39,200. If 40,600 gets taken out on the upside, then 41,500 is an immediate target as well.The three main factors that led to the rally of PB Fintech were:i) Large breakout from a positive divergence and double bottom pattern on the daily chartii) Reacted from a weekly demand zone after forming a very nice rounding base at the same timeiii) Both FIIs and DIIs have increased their holding in this stock and the expectation of a positive quarter has also weighed in on the positive sentiment.Since the stock has turned to an uptrend now, the best level to enter is at Rs 540 level, keeping a stop loss below its previous swing low. For those who hold it, they can expect to have a first target at the Rs 630 levels.Our algorithms at Hedged had suggested a Bearish caution on the monthly charts in the Nifty Metal Index right at the 6,600 levels. A clear negative divergence on the monthly charts in both the momentum indicators. The weekly chart is also showing weakness in the metal index and thus this sector is best avoided until the 5,100 level is reached. The best way to play this sector right now is to get into an SIP in the severely beaten down names which have become attractive from a valuation perspective between the range of 5,100 and 4,500 of the Nifty Metal Index.The only way to play the Adani group stocks right now is to do a Long strangle in them for next month expiries. These stocks are too volatile and will move more on news flow rather than valuation drivers and technical parameters. Traders can look to buy the 1300 PE of March Expiry and the 1500 CE of April-end expiry in Adani Enterprises Once the trade moves partly in one direction say by 10%, look to sell March offset units to bring the overall debit down, as this stock still has very high options premiums and IV has not completely cooled off. It is important to note that these types of trades should be carried out only by people with prior good know-how in options.1) Reliance Long: Stock has formed a positive divergence on the weekly chart and has even formed a morning star pattern at the bottom. It is bouncing up from the bottom end of the trend line channel and is also looking bullish from the Donchian channel & Gann Perspective as well. One can buy with a SL at Rs 2280 with a potential target of Rs 2490 and Rs 2600.2) Wipro Short: Wipro has been trading in a very narrow range for a long period now and the stock is seen expanding on the downside. It has also seen to start walking the lower Band of the Bollinger Band indicator and is breaking out of this narrow range on the downside. The stock has formed a negative divergence on the weekly chart and the Elder ray is showing further signs of weakness. A short can be initiated with a stop loss at Rs 416 and a target of Rs 370 and Rs 351.For the medium-term or couple of months’ outlook, Asian paints also looks good as the monthly chart is seen bouncing from a demand zone. The weekly also has a demand zone which coincides with the momentum indicator bullishness as well. One can hold a target of Rs 3270 to Rs 3300.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own. These do not represent the views of The Economic Times)","The only way to play Adani group stocks right now is to do a long strangle in them for next month expiries.

Gain is for Gautam Adani and loss for Bangladesh: that is how the electricity purchase deal with the Indian business tycoon may turn out to be.

Now at the centre of a scandal over stock market manipulation and fraud that, within a few weeks, contributed to an epic fall from the position of Asia's richest person, Adani has literally taken Bangladesh for a fortune-ride through the controversial deal. Though officially still kept under tight wraps, the agreement has lately been published by a news portal and a number of whistleblowers in public interest.

""This appears to be the most expensive, lopsided contract to replenish the pockets of the ex-richest man in Asia, at the expense of the people in Bangladesh,"" Tim Buckley, a Sydney-based energy expert with 30 years of expertise in the field, told The Daily Star over the phone recently.

Knowingly or unknowingly, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) rushed to sign a deal that only allows Adani Power to mint money at every single phase, from coal purchase to electricity export. The document, in essence, lays bare how Bangladesh is forced to stay in the agreement even if Adani breaches the contract, according to the experts who analysed a copy of the deal obtained by The Daily Star.

For the next 25 years, Bangladesh will partially bear what was initially thought to be Adani Power's tax burden even though the Indian conglomerate got a tax exemption based on the export deal it struck with Bangladesh.

And once the plant comes into commercial operation next month, Bangladesh will start paying Adani reference tariffs based on taxes it does not even pay. In other words, the agreement has a unique design: Adani saves costs but charges Bangladesh the same amount, in turn raking more profits.

It is estimated that Adani Power will save over $1 billion on the Clean Energy Cess (a form of carbon tax) alone over the 25 years of the contract by virtue of becoming a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), according to an investigation by the Washington Post.

That's just the reduction from one type of tax. Adani enjoys myriad other tax benefits and significant cost cuts for becoming an export-oriented plant through the deal with Bangladesh.

""So, the total savings for Adani will be way over $1 billion. For example, Adani also saves around $100 to $200 million on import duties of their equipment from China but it'll charge Bangladesh for the import duties. Its profits will be hefty — to put it lightly,"" Buckley said.

The Indian conglomerate, however, saw no evil. When contacted, a spokesperson from Adani on February 23 said, ""The tax assumptions were uncertain when the deal was signed, and we took a risk fixing the costs. So, the SEZ tax exemption is our savings, in a lump sum contract -- it is business.""

Requesting anonymity for fear of reprisal, the lawyer who reviewed the power purchase agreement for this paper begged to differ. ""In a fair deal favouring both sides, Adani's cut in costs from tax benefits would mean Bangladesh also gets shares of them or at least, a portion of them.""

However, in another interview on February 24, another spokesperson for Adani, said, ""Since the Godda project is at a designated SEZ, power consumers of Bangladesh will not have to pay for the customs duty, taxes and cess, as applicable per current norms.""

Taxes and tariffs apart, Bangladesh is liable to pay roughly $450 million a year in capacity charges, even if it doesn't buy electricity from Adani due to any reason, as stated in the original terms of the contract, Buckley said.

A strong voice for the protection of natural resources, Professor Anu Muhammad thinks that it is not a deal but a gift to Adani, who is seen as the closest ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""As far as unfair deals go, the Adani contract is record-breaking,"" he told The Daily Star.

ADANI'S POSSIBLE BREACH OF CONTRACT

When signing the deal in 2017, Adani Power included a bevy of tax assumptions into the reference tariffs that Bangladesh will have to pay. These include 12 percent excise duties, 15 percent service tax, VAT, and income tax payable in India among others.

In February 2019, Adani's Godda Power Plant became a Special Economic Zone, following amendments to guidelines that previously did not allow a stand-alone power plant to receive such benefits.

Only on the grounds of exporting electricity to Bangladesh, Adani's Godda Power Plant was declared an SEZ, according to the official documents of the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

To interpret it simply, had it not been for Bangladesh, Adani would not have received the exemption from the corporate taxes. Most of Adani's expenditure in excise duties, state goods and services tax, have been nullified by the SEZ declaration, along with a 100 percent deduction in income tax for the first five years.

A clause in the agreement, 13.d (i) stipulates that Adani must officially inform the BPDB of the change in tax assumptions within 30 days. Another clause later in the document purports to allow the BPDB to recover the redundant tax charges, but that too has legal barriers.

Almost four years after the SEZ declaration, Adani has not officially (in writing) informed the BPDB of their exact savings, said a BPDB official, seeking anonymity for sharing what is seen as ""sensitive information"".

As per the Contract Act 1872 of Bangladesh, Adani's concealment of information constitutes a breach of contract and renders the agreement legally void.

A previous analysis by the AdaniWatch — a non-profit project of the Bob Brown Foundation that keeps an eye on the Adani Group's misdeeds across the planet — showed the violation and questioned whether the agreement is legally void. In standard agreements, the innocent party, which is the BPDB in this case, would have two options: ask for compensation or terminate the agreement altogether.

But the contract is not legally void; an unusual clause in the agreement prevents the BPDB from rescinding it.

Section 4.2 (L) states that the BPDB may give a notice of default, in the case of, ""any material breach…by the company of this agreement [Adani], having a material and adverse effect on the company's ability to perform its obligations under the agreement, that is not remedied within sixty [60] days.""

This clause was not used in the power purchase agreements with Payra and Rampal, according to the documents.

Put another way, only when a breach of contract ""adversely affects"" Adani, the BPDB has legal grounds to leave. Hiding the amount of money it is saving from taxes does not hinder Adani's ability to produce. As such, the BPDB has no grounds to opt out of the 25-year binding contract.

Adani did inform the BPDB of the change in taxes, the Adani spokesperson told this paper. The spokesperson was requested to provide proof with the written documentation sent to the BPDB.

Adani spokesperson declined, stating the document is ""business confidential"". The spokesperson said, ""Ask the BPDB for the list of notifications we sent during the last 5 years. If they have compiled correctly, it should be there.""

""When we place the invoice, it will be clear what the cost per unit is. In our calculation, it will be the lowest in Bangladesh,"" claimed the Adani spokesperson.

ADANI PROFITS BY NOT SHARING TAX BENEFITS

At each turn of the deal, page after page, Gautam Adani rakes in profits — on the Carmichael coalmine (Adani's Australian mine that produces high ash, low energy coal), coal port, railway line, the power plant in Godda, and part of the transmission line that he owns.

The agreement is ""cost plus plus,"" said Buckley. It has been designed in a manner that ensures Adani profits more and more, and Bangladesh doesn't get a piece of that cake.

Each time Adani dangled a carrot in front of the BPDB, the very next instance, it took it away.

For example, a clause in the agreement purports to reduce the capacity price when the taxes change. Clause 13.(d) (iv) states, ""Following the commercial operations date, a change in assumptions resulting in a one-time charge or expenditure (or a one-time increase or decrease in a charge or expenditure) shall cause an adjustment in the Reference Capacity Price."" Sounds fair?

The very facade of fairness Adani shows in clause (iv) is quickly counteracted by clause (v) that follows. It states, ""The parties expressly agree that no adjustment shall be applied or paid due to a change in assumption resulting from any change in taxes… until the plant has been commissioned."" This provision further shows that the adjustment will not be done when it favours the BPDB, which is the perfect example of ""discrimination,"" said the lawyer who reviewed the agreement.

Hasan Mehedi, member secretary of the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BGWED), gives an idea about logical re-adjustment in pricing.

""Adani's tax cuts should've decreased the capacity price by 12-15 percent. If we take the current exchange rate, we will pay billions of dollars in 25 years when our foreign currency reserves are depleting.""

Prof Anu Muhammad agrees: ""There was clearly no negotiation here. Adani dictated these terms and Bangladesh went along with it for political gains.""

The lawyer said, ""The misrepresentation aspect of the agreement is that Adani has created a clause that will not allow the BPDB to get any tax holiday or rebate, so they can basically overcharge the capacity price.""

Adani spokesperson said, ""We have to factor in our savings in a business deal. We made the power plant in Jharkhand to reduce our total cost as the value of land price was lower.""

""The design of the agreement is such that if there are additional taxes imposed by the Indian government, those will not be imposed on Bangladesh. The Indian government is now taking steps to ensure that every coal-fired power plant will need to use biomass, which will hamper our efficiency but those costs won't be borne by Bangladesh,"" added the spokesperson.

Tim Buckley said avoiding corporate taxes has long been an avenue for Adani to reduce its costs of production and increase the profit margins. Adani has also set up multiple ways to minimise the amount of tax it pays in Australia, where it has its coal mine.

Filings in Singapore by privately-owned Adani companies show that one of them, Atulya Resources, is registered in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, according to an investigation by ABC's Four Corners programme.

""There is also an ability for $2 per tonne royalty to be paid off to tax a haven from the Carmichael coalmine. So if Adani is buying 7 million tonnes [of coal], then there will be $14 million flying off to some tax haven ... ,"" said Buckley.

WHY DID BANGLADESH SIGN THIS DEAL?

Once US investment research firm Hindenburg blasted Adani Group's brazen stock manipulation and accounting schemes, the alarm bells started ringing in Bangladesh.

Experts in Bangladesh, who previously raised serious concerns regarding the deal, are now questioning why the nation, which has excess power generation capacity, got on board with Adani.

When Hasan Mehedi co-authored an article with India's advocacy institution Growthwatch, Bangladeshi officials hit back saying ""the report was done to ruin the relationship between Bangladesh and India"".

""But our point remains and it's coming out now. This deal will be disastrous for Bangladesh,"" Mehedi said.

""The same officials who signed previous agreements with foreign power plants, okayed Adani's agreement, knowing fully well that it does not favour Bangladesh.""

A source in the BPDB, requesting anonymity, said, ""We didn't get too much time to go through this agreement which was examined by the Power Division itself.""

Contacted on many occasions, the Power Division declined to comment on the matter.

The BPDB chairman was contacted but he refused to comment.

Nasrul Hamid, the state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, responded to a phone call on February 25 but did not respond to specific questions.

As per his request, The Daily Star sent him further questions over WhatsApp but he was yet to respond to those when this report was published.

IS THERE A WAY OUT?

Regarding ways out, Section 19.4 of the power purchase agreement states that any dispute that is not resolved shall finally be settled in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, 2016, 6th Edition.

The BPDB could ideally take the agreement to arbitration in Singapore for termination, the lawyer told The Daily Star.

Anu Muhammad said, ""The public will bear the cost of this expensive contract. We can argue against the deal for it being agreed upon without considering the public interest of Bangladesh.""","Adani enjoys myriad other tax benefits and significant cost cuts for becoming an export-oriented plant through the deal with Bangladesh.

Adani Group Chairman...,2023-03-02 00:00:00,India top court orders probe into allegations against Adani Group,"Court asks market regulator to investigate possible lapses in securities law or other regulatory disclosures by Gautam Adani-led group.

India’s top court has asked the market regulator to investigate any possible lapses in securities law or other regulatory disclosures by the Adani Group which has been accused of business malpractice by a United States-based short seller.

The Supreme Court on Thursday also ordered the formation of an investor protection panel amid sharp falls in the Adani Group’s shares.

Indian markets regulator SEBI has been investigating a critical January 24 report by Hindenburg Research that alleged the Adani Group improperly used offshore tax havens and manipulated stocks. The conglomerate has denied doing so.

SEBI had previously told the court it was investigating the allegations made in the Hindenburg report and market activity immediately preceding and following its publication.

The Supreme Court asked SEBI to check “whether there has been a failure to disclose transactions with related parties” and “whether there was any manipulation of stock prices in contravention of existing laws”.

The ruling was announced by a three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, which heard several public-interest litigations on losses investors suffered due to the stock market rout triggered by the Hindenburg report.

Seven listed companies of the Adani Group have lost about $135bn in value since the report was published.

Billionaire Gautam Adani welcomed the Supreme Court order. “It will bring finality in a time bound manner. Truth will prevail,” he said in a post on Twitter.

Hindenburg Research said in its report it had identified numerous “undisclosed related party transactions” by both listed and private Adani companies, allegedly in violation of Indian disclosure laws.

In its rebuttal, Adani said “all related party transactions are at arm’s length, properly disclosed and reviewed/audited by statutory independent auditors”.

The court also formed an expert panel to be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge to examine how investor protection mechanisms can be strengthened.

The six-member panel, which is due to report back within two months, will include former chairman of the State Bank of India O P Bhatt and prominent banker K V Kamath.

It has been asked “to provide an overall assessment of the situation”, Chandrachud said.

India's supreme court has set up an independent panel to investigate if there were regulatory failures related to allegations against the Adani Group , after a bombshell report from a U.S. short seller. The country's highest court directed a six member panel to probe ""regulatory failure in dealing with the alleged contravention of laws pertaining to the securities market in relation to the Adani Group,"" a Thursday court order said. The committee will also provide an ""overall assessment of the situation including the relevant causal factors which have led to the volatility in the securities market in the recent past,"" added the court order. In addition, the panel will suggest measures to strengthen the regulatory framework and ""secure compliance with the existing framework for the protection of investors."" India's Supreme Court action comes slightly over a month after Hindenburg Research released a lengthy report on Jan. 24, accusing Adani Group of stock manipulation and fraud. In a rebuttal that ran over 400 pages, the group denied any wrongdoing.

The debacle led to a massive selloff in the Group's stocks and has wiped out roughly $140 billion in market value from the seven largest listed companies under the conglomerate. The panel will be headed by Justice Sapre, a retired judge of the Supreme Court. The other members of the committee include OP Bhatt, KV Kamath, Nandan Nilekani and Somsekhar Sundaresan and retired Justice JP Devdhar.

Stock manipulation?

The Supreme Court has also directed the country's markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, to probe ""whether there was any manipulation of stock prices in contravention of existing laws,"" the court order said. ""SEBI shall expeditiously conclude the investigation within two months and file a status report,"" it added.

India's top court said its directive was prompted by the ""loss of investor wealth in the securities market over the last few weeks because of a steep decline in the share price of the Adani Group of companies,"" and a need to protect Indian investors from market volatility. Those petitions included requests to examine issues over ""public money"" being ""at risk because public institutions like the State Bank of India and the Life Insurance Corporation of India are exposed to the Adani Group,"" the court order said. Both institutions told CNBC recently that their exposure to the Adani Group was manageable. In a recent blog, Aswath Damodaran, finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, argued the Adani Group has exploited the ""weakest links"" in India's institutions to its advantage. He also said the Adani affair provides an opportunity for Indian institutions to learn lessons and try to fix the problems.

""As for the institutions involved, which include banks, regulatory authorities and [Life Insurance Corporation], I have learned not to attribute to venality or corruption that which can be attributed to inertia and indifference,"" the economist said on his blog. ""A more nuanced version of the Adani story is that the family group has exploited the seams and weakest links in the India story, to its advantage,"" he said, adding that ""there are lessons for the nation as a whole, as it looks towards what it hopes will be its decade of growth.""

Positive data over manufacturing, services and home sales boosted the investors' morale, pushing the bull higher.



At the domestic level, India's manufacturing activity continued to maintain growth momentum in February as shown by the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index. Moody's Investors Service raised India's economic growth estimate for 2023 to 5.5 per cent from 4.8 per cent also added to the momentum of the markets.

""The Nifty has managed to close in the positive after falling for nine consecutive trading sessions.

The pullback, if any, is likely to be just a relief rally and thus we change our outlook on the Nifty to sideways. The range of consolidation is likely to be 17,700 – 17,200. In terms of levels, 17,340 – 17,300 shall act as a crucial support zone while 17,550 – 17,600 is the immediate hurdle zone for Nifty, he said.



All the sectors of Nifty settled with decent gains during the session. Nifty Metal index surged about 4 per cent, followed by a 3 per cent rise in PSU Bank Index. Nifty Media Index gained about 2 per cent, whereas Auto, Private lenders and IT indices rose about a per cent, each.

Ambuja Cement rose over 3 per cent, whereas Adani Ports and ACC were up by 2 per cent each.



Barring Adani Enterprises, Hindalco rallied about 4 per cent, leading the gainers in the Nifty50 pack. UPL and State Bank of India surged 3 per cent each, whereas IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services and ONGC rose over 2 per cent each.



Only five Nifty stocks ended the day in red. Britannia and Power Grid dropped 2 per cent, each, whereas Cipla shed about a per cent. Bharat Petroleum and HDFC Bank were other laggards on the pack.

A total of 3,626 shares were traded on BSE on Wednesday, of which 2,446 settled lowers. 1,050 stocks ended the session with gains, while 130 shares remained unchanged. 207 shares hit their upper circuit today, whereas 146 tested the lower circuit levels for the day.



The Indian market was oversold and needed encouraging domestic triggers to show signs of revival, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.



""The manufacturing PMI reported was better than predicted at 55.3, even though India's Q3 FY23 GDP statistics came in slightly below expectations. Solid global markets, bolstered by strong Chinese manufacturing data, also ignited optimism in the domestic market,"" he said.

Adani Group Chairman...,2023-03-02 00:00:00,India top court orders probe into allegations against Adani Group,"Court asks market regulator to investigate possible lapses in securities law or other regulatory disclosures by Gautam Adani-led group.

India’s top court has asked the market regulator to investigate any possible lapses in securities law or other regulatory disclosures by the Adani Group which has been accused of business malpractice by a United States-based short seller.

The Supreme Court on Thursday also ordered the formation of an investor protection panel amid sharp falls in the Adani Group’s shares.

Indian markets regulator SEBI has been investigating a critical January 24 report by Hindenburg Research that alleged the Adani Group improperly used offshore tax havens and manipulated stocks. The conglomerate has denied doing so.

SEBI had previously told the court it was investigating the allegations made in the Hindenburg report and market activity immediately preceding and following its publication.

The Supreme Court asked SEBI to check “whether there has been a failure to disclose transactions with related parties” and “whether there was any manipulation of stock prices in contravention of existing laws”.

The ruling was announced by a three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, which heard several public-interest litigations on losses investors suffered due to the stock market rout triggered by the Hindenburg report.

Seven listed companies of the Adani Group have lost about $135bn in value since the report was published.

Billionaire Gautam Adani welcomed the Supreme Court order. “It will bring finality in a time bound manner. Truth will prevail,” he said in a post on Twitter.

Hindenburg Research said in its report it had identified numerous “undisclosed related party transactions” by both listed and private Adani companies, allegedly in violation of Indian disclosure laws.

In its rebuttal, Adani said “all related party transactions are at arm’s length, properly disclosed and reviewed/audited by statutory independent auditors”.

The court also formed an expert panel to be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge to examine how investor protection mechanisms can be strengthened.

The six-member panel, which is due to report back within two months, will include former chairman of the State Bank of India O P Bhatt and prominent banker K V Kamath.

It has been asked “to provide an overall assessment of the situation”, Chandrachud said.

Adani has sought to calm investors and this week held a fixed-income roadshow in Singapore and Hong Kong. The group, according to sources, has told creditors it has secured a $3bn loan from a sovereign wealth fund.

Apart from investigating allegations against Adani, the expert committee is to suggest measures to improve regulatory oversight and protections for investors.

India's supreme court has set up an independent panel to investigate if there were regulatory failures related to allegations against the Adani Group , after a bombshell report from a U.S. short seller. The country's highest court directed a six member panel to probe ""regulatory failure in dealing with the alleged contravention of laws pertaining to the securities market in relation to the Adani Group,"" a Thursday court order said. The committee will also provide an ""overall assessment of the situation including the relevant causal factors which have led to the volatility in the securities market in the recent past,"" added the court order. In addition, the panel will suggest measures to strengthen the regulatory framework and ""secure compliance with the existing framework for the protection of investors."" India's Supreme Court action comes slightly over a month after Hindenburg Research released a lengthy report on Jan. 24, accusing Adani Group of stock manipulation and fraud. In a rebuttal that ran over 400 pages, the group denied any wrongdoing.

The debacle led to a massive selloff in the Group's stocks and has wiped out roughly $140 billion in market value from the seven largest listed companies under the conglomerate. The panel will be headed by Justice Sapre, a retired judge of the Supreme Court. The other members of the committee include OP Bhatt, KV Kamath, Nandan Nilekani and Somsekhar Sundaresan and retired Justice JP Devdhar.

Stock manipulation?

The Supreme Court has also directed the country's markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, to probe ""whether there was any manipulation of stock prices in contravention of existing laws,"" the court order said. ""SEBI shall expeditiously conclude the investigation within two months and file a status report,"" it added.

India's top court said its directive was prompted by the ""loss of investor wealth in the securities market over the last few weeks because of a steep decline in the share price of the Adani Group of companies,"" and a need to protect Indian investors from market volatility. Those petitions included requests to examine issues over ""public money"" being ""at risk because public institutions like the State Bank of India and the Life Insurance Corporation of India are exposed to the Adani Group,"" the court order said. Both institutions told CNBC recently that their exposure to the Adani Group was manageable. In a recent blog, Aswath Damodaran, finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, argued the Adani Group has exploited the ""weakest links"" in India's institutions to its advantage. He also said the Adani affair provides an opportunity for Indian institutions to learn lessons and try to fix the problems.

""As for the institutions involved, which include banks, regulatory authorities and [Life Insurance Corporation], I have learned not to attribute to venality or corruption that which can be attributed to inertia and indifference,"" the economist said on his blog. ""A more nuanced version of the Adani story is that the family group has exploited the seams and weakest links in the India story, to its advantage,"" he said, adding that ""there are lessons for the nation as a whole, as it looks towards what it hopes will be its decade of growth.""

Auditor competence and experience has been in the...,2023-03-03 00:00:00,Adani-Hindenburg row triggers audit quality concerns; study finds firms reluctant to share auditor details,"The independence and quality of the audit firm plays an important role in the overall corporate governance level of a company but firms appear reluctant to share details related to the background and selection process of auditors.

The latest study on the corporate governance levels in some of the top listed companies has found that while the rules for disclosures have been strengthened over the years, companies continue to provide bare minimum details in many aspects related to the audit firm.

“Disclosures around auditor independence, competence, and experience continue to remain poor. While regulations have pushed for disclosure, most companies continue to provide sparse details on the auditors’ background of how they were selected,” stated a report by proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services or IIAS.

The report titled ‘Corporate Governance Scores 2022’ took into account companies that are a part of the BSE-100 index.

To be sure, boards of as many as 23 per cent of the companies that were analysed provided information about the independence, competence, and experience of the statutory auditors, which was a significant jump from two per cent in 2020 and eight per cent in 2021.

This assumes significance also because of the fact that the recent tussle between Adani Group and Hindenburg Research brought to the fore the issue of audit firms after the US-based short seller highlighted the fact that the auditor of Adani Enterprises – the flagship company of the diversified conglomerate – was a little-known firm called Shah Dhandaria & Co, whose partners were in their 20s.

“The recent battle between a short-seller and one of India’s largest business groups has once again brought the debate over audit quality to light,” stated the IIAS report, adding that “it raised pertinent questions regarding the audit quality”.

“Considered a best practice, audit committees must periodically test for auditor independence and audit quality. More so because auditors are no longer reappointed annually – they have five-year terms in case of companies and three-years in case of banks and NBFCs,” said the report.

While the government has established an audit regulator as well – the National Financial Regulatory Authority or NFRA – the watchdog has been “mired in controversy and has become a political hot-button,” stated the report.

Moving forward, we expect the establishment of an audit regulator to make a material difference to the audit quality for corporate India, it added.

This followed a report published by US-based short seller Hindenburg. ICRA notes that while ATGL has staggered some of the capex plans over the next two years considering progress achieved in projects awarded in ninth and tenth rounds. Further, ATGL has funding tie-ups to meet the capex requirements in the near term, it has large capex requirements over the longer term which need significant debt funding. Hence, the Adani Group’s reduced financial flexibility can impact ATGL’s ability to raise funds from the domestic and international markets and result in higher cost of capital.

“ICRA will be monitoring the Adani Group’s ability to raise funds from the domestic/global market as equity/debt at competitive rates. Further, ICRA also sees an increased risk of regulatory/legal scrutiny on the Adani Group entities and its impact on the credit quality of ATGL will be monitored,” the rating agency said.

ICRA noted that any review of investment in ATGL by Total, in the backdrop of current developments leading to any weakening of linkage remains a sensitivity factor and the developments will be monitored.

ICRA noted that the Group’s strong financial flexibility and APSEZL’s track record of refinancing a large part of its debt with borrowings (mostly from overseas debt capital markets) of longer tenures at lower interest rates were the key credit strengths, which have been adversely impacted. ICRA will be monitoring the Group’s ability to raise funds from domestic/global market as equity/debt at competitive rates. Further, ICRA sees an increased risk of regulatory/legal scrutiny on the group entities and its impact on the credit quality of APSEZL will be monitored. However, ICRA notes that the APSEZL’s liquidity profile remains robust and a large repayment of international bond of $650 million is due only in FY2025.","ICRA has revised the outlook for Adani Total Gas Limited (ATGL) and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZL) to Negative on account of the deterioration in the Adani Group’s financial flexibility, following a sharp decline in share prices and an increase in the yield of international bonds raised by the Adani group entities.

Abbott, who had in 2015 as the Prime Minister of Australia decried a court ruling against Adani Group's Carmichael coal mine project, said the relevant regulators will ""do their job"" regarding any allegation of wrongdoing by the apples-to-airport conglomerate.

As much as USD 140 billion of the market value of the conglomerate's listed companies was wiped out after US short seller Hindenburg Research on January 24 accused the Adani empire of ""brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud"" and using a number of offshore shell companies to inflate stock prices. Adani Group has denied all allegations and called them an attack on India.

""I have a lot of respect and admiration for Adani and Adani Group,"" Abbott said at a media briefing here. The coal produced from Adani's Carmichael mines in Australia ""will certainly be part of the ongoing process of electrification here in India."" ""I am all in favour of Adani mine. I thank Adani and his team for what they have done to provide electricity to Indians and jobs and prosperity to Australia,"" he said.

In 2015, when a local court revoked the environmental approval for the Adani building one of the world's largest coal mine in Queensland, Abbot had stated that it was ""tragic for a wider world"" if legal safeguards are allowed to stall large mining projects. The group, in 2019, received the final and last approval for the project and coal mined from Carmichael is routinely shipped to Indian power plants to produce electricity.

On the allegations by Hindenburg Research, Abbott said that he has not seen the details of the report and ""I assume if there is anything in them, the relevant corporate regulators will do their job."" ""As far as I am concerned I regard Adani as a benefactor to Australia and I admire his success in building up a very large diverse business empire from scratch,"" he said.

On India-Australia trade relations, he said the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) implemented between the two countries would help boost economic ties and bilateral trade.""The existing FTA is good... can it be further developed?. Yes, it can (be) and my understanding is that the trade ministers (of both the countries) will start discussions in coming days (on expanding the scope of the existing trade deal),"" he said.

Abbott also said that businesses of both sides should formulate strategies to take advantage of the agreement. ""I will make it my personal mission... to make India a much more important strategic partner of Australia than China,"" the former prime minister said. In recent times, he said it was observed that China is using trade as a weapon against Australia and India would never do anything like that.""India will always going to be a much more reliable economic partner (than China),"" he said.","Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a known backer of Adani Group's coal mine projects in his country, on Thursday came out in support of the embattled group's Chairman Gautam Adani, saying he has a lot of admiration and respect for the tycoon and his company.

Karan Adani is the CEO of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, a port company of the Adani Group.

Speaking at Andhra Global Investors Summit 2023, Adani said that his group operates two large ports - Krishnapatnam and Gangavaram - in the state with a total capacity of 100 million metric tonnes per annum. ""In the next five years, we aim to add another million metric tonnes of capacity and also transform these ports into industrial port cities,"" he said.

Adani said his group, whose functioning has come under scanner following a damaging report by US-based short seller Hindenburg, is also developing 15,000 MW of renewable power projects over the next few years across five districts of Anantapur, Kadappa, Kurnool, Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram.

""Our other investments in the state include cement manufacturing units and data centres,"" he said, adding that presently the conglomerate does not have any cement manufacturing capacity in Andhra Pradesh.

""Hence, as part of our expansion plans, we will be setting up cement plants in Kadapa and Nadikudi with a total capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum,"" he said.

Last year, Adani Group bought Ambuja and ACC from Swiss cement major Holcim and became the second-largest cement player in India. After the acquisition, Karan Adani was appointed as a non-executive director of Ambuja Cement and as the non-executive chairman of ACC.

Now he may bring the same aggression to entertainment by not charging customers for cricket, even though he has paid top dollar to acquire the rights.

Last June, Viacom18 Media Pvt., a joint venture between Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. and Paramount Global, spent $2.7 billion to win an exclusive, five-year live-streaming deal for Indian Premier League matches, outbidding Walt Disney & Co., the previous owner. Disney’s Hotstar app eked out 76 cents a month from each of the 50 million Indian subscribers who signed up primarily to watch IPL in the cricket-crazy nation. If that was chump change, Ambani has decided to forgo it altogether — at least for this year’s tournament that starts March 31. He may have a bigger prize in mind: commerce.

The timing is just right for the eyeball-grabbing initiative. Jio Platforms Ltd., Ambani’s almost-seven-year-old mobile-internet startup, is probably headed for an initial public offering — after global investors get over the $140 billion meltdown in rival Gautam Adani’s debt-fueled stocks. Adani, too, has an ambitious plan for a consumer super-app, though his priority now must be to steady his sprawling infrastructure empire. With Adani distracted, Ambani’s burgeoning digital domain might get a leg up.

Ambani and Adani. The two billionaires have adopted different playbooks. While Adani went headlong into public utilities, Ambani has focused on private wants. Adani’s problem is that while Indians crave better roads, airports and more reliable power, most users lack the ability — or the willingness — to pay for the costly capital required to build new assets. In Ambani’s case, too, the underlying weakness, which has forced the refining and petrochemicals conglomerate to undertake a consumer pivot, is profitability. Reliance’s legacy business spews out cash, but it takes lumpy investments that don’t generate a high return on equity.

Ambani’s consumer strategy is a mix of carriage, content and commerce. Of the three, the plan for carriage is secure, with Jio Platforms boasting of more than 430 million subscribers and the retailing business, the country’s largest, recording more than half a billion transactions in the past six months.

Establishing supremacy over commerce, though, won’t be easy. Jio’s cutthroat pricing deserves credit for India’s increased penetration of smartphones and proliferation of affordable data plans. But those enabling features have aided Amazon. com Inc. and Walmart Inc.-backed Flipkart to sign up middle-class Indian spenders in smaller cities. In contrast to these pure e-commerce channels, Ambani’s “phygital"" retail model is clunkier: It aims to enlist the neighborhood grocer to fulfill digital orders.

For this idea to take off, Ambani will need to create demand for staples. That’s what his network of mom-and-pop stores can supply most successfully. Which is where the third leg of the strategy — content — comes into play. The tycoon tested the market by showing the soccer World Cup in India for free on JioCinema, with an audience of 32 million tuning in to watch the Argentina-France final. The experiment wasn’t exactly a smooth experience for viewers, but if the group can do better with the IPL franchise, large advertisers like the local units of Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. will come with their checkbooks. More importantly, Ambani may want to use the free content to push his own in-house brands from foodstuff to cleaning liquids.

Ninety percent of India’s trade passes through neighborhood stores. Brands that control distribution networks, comprising millions of small, independent shops, garner some of the highest returns on capital among publicly traded firms. But this so-called general trade depends heavily on advertising to drive demand. That’s why free livestreaming may be so crucial for Ambani. He can peddle his own Good Life rice, and Get Real shower gel, just like his father had once hawked polyester suits on India’s national television.

Silicon Valley has billions of dollars riding on Jio Platforms’ IPO. Back in the summer of 2020, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. invested $5.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, in the business. Other prominent California-based investors included Silver Lake Partners, Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. It was a fast-growing franchise back then, with one problem: Jio subscribers didn’t even pay $2 per month, on average. The telco’s aggressive campaign to win market share in India was keeping a lid on price plans.

That’s changing. Jio’s most recent per-user revenue has risen past $2 a month. The Indian mobile market is now reaching saturation levels — growth in new subscribers is slowing. It’s only with 10% annual price increases for three years that Jio will hit a 12-month Ebitda(1) in the vicinity of $9 billion in March 2025, according to Jefferies. Without the boost, Ebitda may be 25% lower. “This could meaningfully impact Jio's valuation around listing,"" Akshat Agarwal, a tech analyst at Jefferies India Pvt., wrote in a Jan. 10 note.

When Meta, then known as Facebook, had acquired a near-10% stake in Jio, it had valued the franchise at roughly $66 billion. In December this year, the enterprise should be worth around $90 billion, in Jefferies’ estimates, including $22 billion in net debt. By the time Jio goes public in 2024 or 2025, the currently ongoing 5G-related expenditure would be tapering off. Once investors see net debt sliding as a ratio of a growing Ebitda, they might give the existing set of Silicon Valley backers handsome exits. If they also envision a lucrative business in consumer staples riding the coattails of telecom carriage, they’ll open their purse strings wider. For the latter narrative to take hold, free advertising to an audience held hostage by cricket may be key.

This year’s IPL will conclude in Ahmedabad, in a stadium named after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with its two bowling ends informally known as Reliance and Adani. Make no mistake: This is a contest between two rich, powerful men, neither of whom has yet proved why they deserve to win. A successful Jio fundraising, following a flop of a public offer by Adani Enterprises Ltd., will put Ambani in the lead, reversing an outcome that even last year had the other magnate pulling ahead. Cricket, they say, is a game of glorious uncertainties.

SC hearing

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court of India set up a six-member expert committee to look into the Adani Group stock crash and fraud allegations following the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research report.

Former Supreme Court judge Justice AM Sapre will head the committee. The other members include OP Bhat (former chairman of SBI), Justice JP Devadhar, KV Kamath, Nandan Nilekani, and Somasekharan Sundaresan.

Besides, the Supreme Court also asked the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to finish the probe into the Adani Group-Hindenburg saga within a period of two months.

The apex court observed that setting up the panel doesn’t divest Sebi from its duty of investigating volatility in the market.

The SC directed SEBI to investigate whether there has been a violation of Section 19 of SEBI rules, and whether “there was any manipulation of stock prices”.

After the verdict, Adani Group's founder chairman Gautam Adani said that the recent Supreme Court order will bring finality in a time-bound manner.

Hindenburg Research in its report had accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the last few decades. It said the conglomerate has been using a number of offshore shell companies to inflate stock prices

However, the Adani Group denied the allegation.

Adani stocks recovery

By end of Thursday, all the Adani Group stocks added Rs 30,000 crore in market capitalisation. All the group companies ended with gains and have added Rs 1 lakh crore in market capitalisation over the last three sessions.

Adani Enterprises ended the day's trade with gains of 1.5 per cent. Adani Ports was one of the top gainers of Nifty 50 with gains of 3 per cent. ACC and Ambuja gained 1.4 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively.

The Wire,2023-03-02 14:39:50.639483,"Heads Adani Wins, Tails Bangladesh Loses: A Lopsided Power Deal",https://thewire.in/business/heads-adani-wins-tails-bangladesh-loses-a-lopsided-power-deal,Gain is for Gautam Adani and loss for Bangladesh: that is how the electricity purchase deal with the Indian business tycoon may turn out to be.,None,"Heads Adani Wins, Tails Bangladesh Loses: A Lopsided Power Deal","Gain is for Gautam Adani and loss for Bangladesh: that is how the electricity purchase deal with the Indian business tycoon may turn out to be.

Now at the centre of a scandal over stock market manipulation and fraud that, within a few weeks, contributed to an epic fall from the position of Asia’s richest person, Adani has literally taken Bangladesh for a fortune-ride through the controversial deal. Though officially still kept under tight wraps, the agreement has lately been published by a news portal and a number of whistleblowers in public interest.

“This appears to be the most expensive, lopsided contract to replenish the pockets of the ex-richest man in Asia, at the expense of the people in Bangladesh,” Tim Buckley, a Sydney-based energy expert with 30 years of expertise in the field, told The Daily Star over the phone recently.

Knowingly or unknowingly, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) rushed to sign a deal that only allows Adani Power to mint money at every single phase, from coal purchase to electricity export. The document, in essence, lays bare how Bangladesh is forced to stay in the agreement even if Adani breaches the contract, according to the experts who analysed a copy of the deal obtained by The Daily Star.

For the next 25 years, Bangladesh will partially bear what was initially thought to be Adani Power’s tax burden even though the Indian conglomerate got a tax exemption based on the export deal it struck with Bangladesh.

Also read: Numbers Suggest Bangladesh Didn’t Need the Adani Power Deal. So Why Was it Signed?

And once the plant comes into commercial operation next month, Bangladesh will start paying Adani reference tariffs based on taxes it does not even pay. In other words, the agreement has a unique design: Adani saves costs but charges Bangladesh the same amount, in turn raking more profits.

It is estimated that Adani Power will save over $1 billion on the Clean Energy Cess (a form of carbon tax) alone over the 25 years of the contract by virtue of becoming a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), according to an investigation by the Washington Post.

That’s just the reduction from one type of tax. Adani enjoys myriad other tax benefits and significant cost cuts for becoming an export-oriented plant through the deal with Bangladesh.

“So, the total savings for Adani will be way over $1 billion. For example, Adani also saves around $100 to $200 million on import duties of their equipment from China but it’ll charge Bangladesh for the import duties. Its profits will be hefty — to put it lightly,” Buckley said.

The Indian conglomerate, however, saw no evil. When contacted, a spokesperson from Adani on February 23 said, “The tax assumptions were uncertain when the deal was signed, and we took a risk fixing the costs. So, the SEZ tax exemption is our savings, in a lump sum contract – it is business.”

Requesting anonymity for fear of reprisal, the lawyer who reviewed the power purchase agreement for this paper begged to differ. “In a fair deal favouring both sides, Adani’s cut in costs from tax benefits would mean Bangladesh also gets shares of them or at least, a portion of them.”

However, in another interview on February 24, another spokesperson for Adani, said, “Since the Godda project is at a designated SEZ, power consumers of Bangladesh will not have to pay for the customs duty, taxes and cess, as applicable per current norms.”

Taxes and tariffs apart, Bangladesh is liable to pay roughly $450 million a year in capacity charges, even if it doesn’t buy electricity from Adani due to any reason, as stated in the original terms of the contract, Buckley said.

A strong voice for the protection of natural resources, Professor Anu Muhammad thinks that it is not a deal but a gift to Adani, who is seen as the closest ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“As far as unfair deals go, the Adani contract is record-breaking,” he told The Daily Star.

Adani’s possible breach of contract

When signing the deal in 2017, Adani Power included a bevy of tax assumptions into the reference tariffs that Bangladesh will have to pay. These include 12 percent excise duties, 15 percent service tax, VAT, and income tax payable in India among others.

In February 2019, Adani’s Godda Power Plant became a Special Economic Zone, following amendments to guidelines that previously did not allow a stand-alone power plant to receive such benefits.

Only on the grounds of exporting electricity to Bangladesh, Adani’s Godda Power Plant was declared an SEZ, according to the official documents of the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

To interpret it simply, had it not been for Bangladesh, Adani would not have received the exemption from the corporate taxes. Most of Adani’s expenditure in excise duties, state goods and services tax, have been nullified by the SEZ declaration, along with a 100 percent deduction in income tax for the first five years.

A clause in the agreement, 13.d (i) stipulates that Adani must officially inform the BPDB of the change in tax assumptions within 30 days. Another clause later in the document purports to allow the BPDB to recover the redundant tax charges, but that too has legal barriers.

Almost four years after the SEZ declaration, Adani has not officially (in writing) informed the BPDB of their exact savings, said a BPDB official, seeking anonymity for sharing what is seen as “sensitive information”.

As per the Contract Act 1872 of Bangladesh, Adani’s concealment of information constitutes a breach of contract and renders the agreement legally void.

A previous analysis by the AdaniWatch — a non-profit project of the Bob Brown Foundation that keeps an eye on the Adani Group’s misdeeds across the planet — showed the violation and questioned whether the agreement is legally void. In standard agreements, the innocent party, which is the BPDB in this case, would have two options: ask for compensation or terminate the agreement altogether.

But the contract is not legally void; an unusual clause in the agreement prevents the BPDB from rescinding it.

Section 4.2 (L) states that the BPDB may give a notice of default, in the case of, “any material breach…by the company of this agreement [Adani], having a material and adverse effect on the company’s ability to perform its obligations under the agreement, that is not remedied within sixty [60] days.”

This clause was not used in the power purchase agreements with Payra and Rampal, according to the documents.

Put another way, only when a breach of contract “adversely affects” Adani, the BPDB has legal grounds to leave. Hiding the amount of money it is saving from taxes does not hinder Adani’s ability to produce. As such, the BPDB has no grounds to opt out of the 25-year binding contract.

Adani did inform the BPDB of the change in taxes, the Adani spokesperson told this paper. The spokesperson was requested to provide proof with the written documentation sent to the BPDB.

Adani spokesperson declined, stating the document is “business confidential”. The spokesperson said, “Ask the BPDB for the list of notifications we sent during the last 5 years. If they have compiled correctly, it should be there.”

“When we place the invoice, it will be clear what the cost per unit is. In our calculation, it will be the lowest in Bangladesh,” claimed the Adani spokesperson.

Adani profits by not sharing tax benefits

At each turn of the deal, page after page, Gautam Adani rakes in profits — on the Carmichael coalmine (Adani’s Australian mine that produces high ash, low energy coal), coal port, railway line, the power plant in Godda, and part of the transmission line that he owns.

The agreement is “cost plus plus,” said Buckley. It has been designed in a manner that ensures Adani profits more and more, and Bangladesh doesn’t get a piece of that cake.

Each time Adani dangled a carrot in front of the BPDB, the very next instance, it took it away.

For example, a clause in the agreement purports to reduce the capacity price when the taxes change. Clause 13.(d) (iv) states, “Following the commercial operations date, a change in assumptions resulting in a one-time charge or expenditure (or a one-time increase or decrease in a charge or expenditure) shall cause an adjustment in the Reference Capacity Price.” Sounds fair?

The very facade of fairness Adani shows in clause (iv) is quickly counteracted by clause (v) that follows. It states, “The parties expressly agree that no adjustment shall be applied or paid due to a change in assumption resulting from any change in taxes… until the plant has been commissioned.” This provision further shows that the adjustment will not be done when it favours the BPDB, which is the perfect example of “discrimination,” said the lawyer who reviewed the agreement.

Hasan Mehedi, member secretary of the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BGWED), gives an idea about logical re-adjustment in pricing.

“Adani’s tax cuts should’ve decreased the capacity price by 12-15 percent. If we take the current exchange rate, we will pay billions of dollars in 25 years when our foreign currency reserves are depleting.”

Prof Anu Muhammad agrees: “There was clearly no negotiation here. Adani dictated these terms and Bangladesh went along with it for political gains.”

The lawyer said, “The misrepresentation aspect of the agreement is that Adani has created a clause that will not allow the BPDB to get any tax holiday or rebate, so they can basically overcharge the capacity price.”

Adani spokesperson said, “We have to factor in our savings in a business deal. We made the power plant in Jharkhand to reduce our total cost as the value of land price was lower.”

“The design of the agreement is such that if there are additional taxes imposed by the Indian government, those will not be imposed on Bangladesh. The Indian government is now taking steps to ensure that every coal-fired power plant will need to use biomass, which will hamper our efficiency but those costs won’t be borne by Bangladesh,” added the spokesperson.

Tim Buckley said avoiding corporate taxes has long been an avenue for Adani to reduce its costs of production and increase the profit margins. Adani has also set up multiple ways to minimise the amount of tax it pays in Australia, where it has its coal mine.

Filings in Singapore by privately-owned Adani companies show that one of them, Atulya Resources, is registered in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, according to an investigation by ABC’s Four Corners programme.

“There is also an ability for $2 per tonne royalty to be paid off to tax a haven from the Carmichael coalmine. So if Adani is buying 7 million tonnes [of coal], then there will be $14 million flying off to some tax haven … ,” said Buckley.

Why did Bangladesh sign the deal?

Once US investment research firm Hindenburg blasted Adani Group’s brazen stock manipulation and accounting schemes, the alarm bells started ringing in Bangladesh.

Experts in Bangladesh, who previously raised serious concerns regarding the deal, are now questioning why the nation, which has excess power generation capacity, got on board with Adani.

When Hasan Mehedi co-authored an article with India’s advocacy institution Growthwatch, Bangladeshi officials hit back saying “the report was done to ruin the relationship between Bangladesh and India”.

“But our point remains and it’s coming out now. This deal will be disastrous for Bangladesh,” Mehedi said.

“The same officials who signed previous agreements with foreign power plants, okayed Adani’s agreement, knowing fully well that it does not favour Bangladesh.”

A source in the BPDB, requesting anonymity, said, “We didn’t get too much time to go through this agreement which was examined by the Power Division itself.”

Contacted on many occasions, the Power Division declined to comment on the matter.

The BPDB chairman was contacted but he refused to comment.

Nasrul Hamid, the state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, responded to a phone call on February 25 but did not respond to specific questions.

As per his request, The Daily Star sent him further questions over WhatsApp but he was yet to respond to those when this report was published.

Is there a way out?

Regarding ways out, Section 19.4 of the power purchase agreement states that any dispute that is not resolved shall finally be settled in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, 2016, 6th Edition.

The BPDB could ideally take the agreement to arbitration in Singapore for termination, the lawyer told The Daily Star.

Anu Muhammad said, “The public will bear the cost of this expensive contract. We can argue against the deal for it being agreed upon without considering the public interest of Bangladesh.”

While corporate governance issues affect countries globally, what is different about the Adani case for India is that its ""highly political,"" Alicia Garcia Herrero told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday.

This is especially true now, she noted, since the country's Supreme Court has launched an investigations into the Adani Group's allegations.

Indian billionaire founder Gautam Adani has been under scrutiny after allegations in January from U.S. short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the Adani Group of companies of fraud.

The Adani Group has denied any wrongdoing, but it did not stop the market rout that wiped out roughly $140 billion in market value from the seven largest listed companies under the conglomerate. Adani, India's top industrialist, has since lost his crown as Asia's wealthiest man.

Investor concerns over Adani's governance problems will likely be short term, said Herrero.

However, the long-term political fallout for India remains to be seen, the economist said. Given the close ties between Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, its still unclear whether the turmoil could hurt the Indian leader politically, Herrero said.

The picture could be get further complicated by India's G-20 presidency this year.

""I would argue, if things have to be pushed further and there [are] closer linkages, in terms of how this falls out with Modi — it can become highly difficult, given the G-20 and of course, in the run up to the elections,"" said Herrero.

""That's why we need to watch because it goes beyond the group in a way"" in terms of ""what the consequences for India might eventually be,"" she noted.","The fallout from the Adani Group turmoil could have political implications for India, said a chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis.

With this repayment to various international banks and Indian financial institutions, shares of four listed Adani companies will be released, the Gautam Adani-led group said in a statement. The prepayment is seen as yet another move to soothe concerns among investors and lenders.

The four Adani companies with the number of shares and promoter shareholding released are Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (155 million shares or 11.8%), Adani Enterprises Ltd (31 million shares or 4%), Adani Transmission Ltd (36 million shares or 4.5%), and Adani Green Energy Ltd (11 million shares or 1.2%).

Over the past month, the Adani family has paid off ₹11,000 crore of debts to lower the group’s leverage.

Along with last month’s repayments, Adani has now repaid $2.02 billion of share-backed financing, in line with promoters’ commitment to prepay all share-backed financing before 31 March 2023, the statement said.

Some Adani group stocks may continue their recovery when markets open on Wednesday after the Holi holiday on prepayment of promoter debt. The prepayment of ₹7,374 crore, coupled with the removal of Adani Enterprises from short-term additional surveillance measures (ASM) effective 8 March, could provide a sentimental boost.

SYDNEY, March 8 (Reuters) - GQG Partners would likely expand its investment in the Adani group, the fund firm's founder Rajiv Jain said on Wednesday, a week after its $1.9 billion infusion into the embattled Indian conglomerate.

""Chances are we'll probably buy more because we typically initiate a position and then depending on how things go and how the earnings come through we tend to get it to full size because we're not at full size at this point,"" Jain said on a call with journalists in Sydney.

GQG Partners, co-founded by Jain in 2016, bought shares worth $1.87 billion in four Adani group companies, marking the first major investment in the Indian conglomerate since a short-seller's critical report in January sparked a stock rout.

Jain, based in Florida, flew to Australia this week for talks with investors, which include some of Australia's largest pension funds. Last week, pension fund investor Cbus Super, with A$71 billion ($46.82 billion) under management, told Reuters they had queried GQG about the Adani purchase.

A GQG spokesperson said Jain's trip had been planned for some time and the discussions included topics other than Adani.

""The response actually has been, frankly, more positive than I would have anticipated because they feel that's how we differentiate ourselves,"" Jain said, when asked how the clients have responded to the Adani deal.

""We do our deep dive, and we don't follow the herd,"" he said.

Jain said he has not had a conversation with the Adani group since the transaction because ""there is nothing to talk about"".

""We feel that we got an incredible opportunity to initiate positions and over time, the size will increase and most likely will increase depending on the price and how they deliver...,"" he said.

ESG TARGETS

New York-based short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the Adani group in a Jan. 24 report of stock manipulation and improper use of offshore tax havens that it said obscured the extent of Adani family stock ownership in group firms. The group has denied the charges.

The allegations resulted in seven of the Indian group's listed firms losing about $130 billion in market value, and the group also shelved a $2.5 billion share sale.

Adani has major coal assets, which could affect the environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets of superannuation and other Australian investors.

Jain said he agrees on the long-term energy transition but fossil fuel cannot be shut off now.

""It's a more convenient issue rather than a substantive issue. A lot of people simply do box checking exercise. We feel that you need to make the transition, but the transition has to be based on some realistic aspects,"" he said.

While corporate governance issues affect countries globally, what is different about the Adani case for India is that its ""highly political,"" Alicia Garcia Herrero told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday.

This is especially true now, she noted, since the country's Supreme Court has launched an investigations into the Adani Group's allegations.

Indian billionaire founder Gautam Adani has been under scrutiny after allegations in January from U.S. short-seller firm Hindenburg Research that accused the Adani Group of companies of fraud.

The Adani Group has denied any wrongdoing, but it did not stop the market rout that wiped out roughly $140 billion in market value from the seven largest listed companies under the conglomerate. Adani, India's top industrialist, has since lost his crown as Asia's wealthiest man.

Investor concerns over Adani's governance problems will likely be short term, said Herrero.

However, the long-term political fallout for India remains to be seen, the economist said. Given the close ties between Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, its still unclear whether the turmoil could hurt the Indian leader politically, Herrero said.

The picture could be get further complicated by India's G-20 presidency this year.

""I would argue, if things have to be pushed further and there [are] closer linkages, in terms of how this falls out with Modi — it can become highly difficult, given the G-20 and of course, in the run up to the elections,"" said Herrero.

""That's why we need to watch because it goes beyond the group in a way"" in terms of ""what the consequences for India might eventually be,"" she noted.","The fallout from the Adani Group turmoil could have political implications for India, said a chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis.

His group, which includes 10 listed companies, saw its market capitalisation (m-cap) recovering to Rs 9 lakh crore level, still way away from Rs 19.20 lakh crore level as on January 24, the day Hindenburg came out with its scathing report on alleged stock manipulation and accounting fraud at the group companies.

Adani, 60, was last valued at $52.1 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaire index. His personal wealth hit a low of $37.70 billion on February 27 amid relentless selloff in his group shares such as Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission Ltd, Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd. That said, the billionaire still has lost 57 per cent or $68.5 billion notionally in 2023 so far. Adani was the second richest on this planet in September 2022.

On Wednesday, at least four of Adani group stocks hit their upper circuit limits. Adani Power hit its 5 per cent upper circuit limit at Rs 186.75. Adani Transmission hit its upper circuit at Rs 819.90. Adani Green Energy was locked at its upper circuit limit of Rs 619.60. Adani Total Gas also hit its upper circuit limit at Rs 861.90.

In total, Adani group commanded a m-cap of Rs 9,12,631.78 crore in Wednesday's trade.

The Adani shares have recovered recently after the group said it has repaid share-based financing of Rs 7,374 crore and would prepay all such remaining loans by the end of the month. Besides, SB Adani Family Trust last week sold Rs 15,446 crore worth stakes in four Adani group firms to US-based GQG Partners. Besides, the conglomerate has lined up more road shows to shore up investor confidence after Hindenburg Research's scathing report on January 24, which sent the group market capitalisation falling as much as $150 billion recently. The moves are seen boosting investor confidence, as seen in the recent recovery in Adani group shares.

SYDNEY, March 8 (Reuters) - GQG Partners would likely expand its investment in the Adani group, the fund firm's founder Rajiv Jain said on Wednesday, a week after its $1.9 billion infusion into the embattled Indian conglomerate.

""Chances are we'll probably buy more because we typically initiate a position and then depending on how things go and how the earnings come through we tend to get it to full size because we're not at full size at this point,"" Jain said on a call with journalists in Sydney.

GQG Partners, co-founded by Jain in 2016, bought shares worth $1.87 billion in four Adani group companies, marking the first major investment in the Indian conglomerate since a short-seller's critical report in January sparked a stock rout.

Jain, based in Florida, flew to Australia this week for talks with investors, which include some of Australia's largest pension funds. Last week, pension fund investor Cbus Super, with A$71 billion ($46.82 billion) under management, told Reuters they had queried GQG about the Adani purchase.

A GQG spokesperson said Jain's trip had been planned for some time and the discussions included topics other than Adani.

""The response actually has been, frankly, more positive than I would have anticipated because they feel that's how we differentiate ourselves,"" Jain said, when asked how the clients have responded to the Adani deal.

""We do our deep dive, and we don't follow the herd,"" he said.

Jain said he has not had a conversation with the Adani group since the transaction because ""there is nothing to talk about"".

""We feel that we got an incredible opportunity to initiate positions and over time, the size will increase and most likely will increase depending on the price and how they deliver...,"" he said.

ESG TARGETS

New York-based short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the Adani group in a Jan. 24 report of stock manipulation and improper use of offshore tax havens that it said obscured the extent of Adani family stock ownership in group firms. The group has denied the charges.

The allegations resulted in seven of the Indian group's listed firms losing about $130 billion in market value, and the group also shelved a $2.5 billion share sale.

Adani has major coal assets, which could affect the environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets of superannuation and other Australian investors.

Jain said he agrees on the long-term energy transition but fossil fuel cannot be shut off now.

""It's a more convenient issue rather than a substantive issue. A lot of people simply do box checking exercise. We feel that you need to make the transition, but the transition has to be based on some realistic aspects,"" he said.

He said that LIC after the meeting is more confident of its business prospects with the port-to-power conglomerate, Kumar told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.

Last month, in an exclusive interview with Business Today TV Managing Editor, Siddharth Zarabi, Kumar said LIC is scheduled to meet the Adani Group management to get a better understanding of the whole issue.

The port-to-power conglomerate has been under fire since US-based short seller Hindenburg Research accused the Gautam Adani-led group of stock manipulation, running offshore shell companies for round-tripping, and misusing corporate governance practices.

Since the report was made public, LIC's exposure to Adani group firms' stock has come under scrutiny. The insurance major has invested in seven of 10 listed companies of the Adani Group. As of December 2022, LIC held 9.14 per cent in Adani Ports; 5.96 per cent in Adani Total Gas; 4.23 per cent in Adani Enterprises; 3.65 per cent in Adani Transmission; and 1.28 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

As of December 2022, LIC held 9.14 per cent in Adani Ports; 5.96 per cent in Adani Total Gas; 4.23 per cent in Adani Enterprises; 3.65 per cent in Adani Transmission; and 1.28 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

The issue has also rocked the parliament after the Opposition parties claimed that LIC and SBI’s “overexposure in Adani group stocks” is a major scam. On February 24, the value of shares LIC held in the Adani Group dropped to Rs 29,893.13 crore against a purchase price of Rs 30,127 crore.

The group, after the report was out, said the total purchase value of equity, purchased over the last many years, under all the Adani Group companies was over Rs 36,000 crore and the market value as on January 27 was Rs 56,142 crore.

But following this, the insurance major lost a huge amount following the massive selloff in Adani stocks.

In mid-February, the state-run insurance company lost nearly Rs 50,000 crore on its investments in the Adani group stocks. The combined market value of its investments in seven Adani stocks - Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission, Ambuja Cements and ACC - plunged to Rs 33,242 crore as on February 23 from Rs 82,970 crore as on December 31, 2022.

On February 27, shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India hit their 52-week low level of Rs 566 against a previous close of Rs 584.65. The weakness in Adani stocks and deep erosion in market capitalisation (m-cap) got reflected on the LIC counter as well.

The state-run insurance giant recovered its losses on its investment in the Adani Group stocks after shares of the conglomerate rose for the third consecutive session last week.

In the last one month, shares of Adani Ports have risen 25.36 per cent. On Friday, the shares of Adani Ports rose nearly 10 per cent to settle at Rs 684.35 while Adani Green Energy jumped 5 per cent to close at Rs 562.

However, a rally in the Adani stocks following massive investment from a global investment firm has recovered LIC's notional losses. The ten listed Adani Group firms saw their combined market capitalisation climb a whopping Rs 1.73 lakh crore in the past four trading sessions till March 3.

The value of LIC's investment in the embattled group has risen by about Rs 9,000 crore and now stands at Rs 39,068.34 crore, as of March 3.

Jain's investment follows a massive decline in Adani's stock price amid criticism of the Indian firm's practices. The main company — Adani Enterprises — has lost 48% year-to-date amid allegations of fraud and stock price manipulation from short seller Hindenburg, who released a wide-ranging report in late January. Adani has rejected the accusations, but the group's billionaire chairman quickly lost his ranking as Asia's richest man as shares of his eight publicly listed stocks went into freefall.



And, yes, Jain has read the report but says he did his own research and came to a different conclusion.



""We read the report but you know, we get paid to do our own research and we did our own work and we had a different opinion,"" he told CNBC.

""After doing our due diligence, we talked to some of the bankers we talked to some of their partners and actually, it's kind of remarkable how consistent the feedback was."" When in conversation with ""one of the largest bankers,"" Jain asked if they would ever give Adani more money and the answer he received was: ""Of course.""



Jain's investment announced Thursday provides some level of relief. Shares of Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports are up 66% and 23% over the past seven days, respectively. Adani is in the middle of a global bond roadshow, two sources close to the matter told CNBC, which will head to the U.S. in the coming weeks and focus on fixed-income investors. How receptive investors are in these upcoming meetings could signal whether other established investors also see opportunity in Adani's infrastructure portfolio. When asked about India's Supreme Court ordering an investigation into Adani's business, Jain said the regulatory risk was ""low."" ""Business regulation tends to be a risk … nothing is a zero probability, but I think it's a low enough probability for us to invest.""



While Jain has been a long-term investor across developed and emerging markets like India, he doesn't have a personal relationship with Adani but has been keeping an eye on the company for the past five years.



""No, I've not known him at all … some of our team members met some of the management last summer,"" said Jain.

He said that LIC after the meeting is more confident of its business prospects with the port-to-power conglomerate, Kumar told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.

Last month, in an exclusive interview with Business Today TV Managing Editor, Siddharth Zarabi, Kumar said LIC is scheduled to meet the Adani Group management to get a better understanding of the whole issue.

The port-to-power conglomerate has been under fire since US-based short seller Hindenburg Research accused the Gautam Adani-led group of stock manipulation, running offshore shell companies for round-tripping, and misusing corporate governance practices.

Since the report was made public, LIC's exposure to Adani group firms' stock has come under scrutiny. The insurance major has invested in seven of 10 listed companies of the Adani Group. As of December 2022, LIC held 9.14 per cent in Adani Ports; 5.96 per cent in Adani Total Gas; 4.23 per cent in Adani Enterprises; 3.65 per cent in Adani Transmission; and 1.28 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

As of December 2022, LIC held 9.14 per cent in Adani Ports; 5.96 per cent in Adani Total Gas; 4.23 per cent in Adani Enterprises; 3.65 per cent in Adani Transmission; and 1.28 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

The issue has also rocked the parliament after the Opposition parties claimed that LIC and SBI’s “overexposure in Adani group stocks” is a major scam. On February 24, the value of shares LIC held in the Adani Group dropped to Rs 29,893.13 crore against a purchase price of Rs 30,127 crore.

The group, after the report was out, said the total purchase value of equity, purchased over the last many years, under all the Adani Group companies was over Rs 36,000 crore and the market value as on January 27 was Rs 56,142 crore.

But following this, the insurance major lost a huge amount following the massive selloff in Adani stocks.

In mid-February, the state-run insurance company lost nearly Rs 50,000 crore on its investments in the Adani group stocks. The combined market value of its investments in seven Adani stocks - Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission, Ambuja Cements and ACC - plunged to Rs 33,242 crore as on February 23 from Rs 82,970 crore as on December 31, 2022.

On February 27, shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India hit their 52-week low level of Rs 566 against a previous close of Rs 584.65. The weakness in Adani stocks and deep erosion in market capitalisation (m-cap) got reflected on the LIC counter as well.

The state-run insurance giant recovered its losses on its investment in the Adani Group stocks after shares of the conglomerate rose for the third consecutive session last week.

In the last one month, shares of Adani Ports have risen 25.36 per cent. On Friday, the shares of Adani Ports rose nearly 10 per cent to settle at Rs 684.35 while Adani Green Energy jumped 5 per cent to close at Rs 562.

However, a rally in the Adani stocks following massive investment from a global investment firm has recovered LIC's notional losses. The ten listed Adani Group firms saw their combined market capitalisation climb a whopping Rs 1.73 lakh crore in the past four trading sessions till March 3.

The value of LIC's investment in the embattled group has risen by about Rs 9,000 crore and now stands at Rs 39,068.34 crore, as of March 3.

The weekly price action resulted in a small bull candle carrying lower high-low, indicating buying demand emerging from key support of 17,200 backed by improving market breadth, said ICICIDirect Research.



""We expect the index to hold key support of 17,200 and head towards short-term hurdle of 17,800, sustainability above which would lead to an acceleration of upward momentum towards 18,300 in March as it is 61.8 per cent retracement of past three months decline.

The trend reversal in Nifty led by banking and metals has more legs to go. When the market gets oversold, as happened in recent weeks, the bounce back triggered by short-covering can be sharp.

""This week may throw up some important triggers relating to US non-farm payroll data and takeaways from the Fed chief Powell’s views on the US economic outlook.

The group had reportedly held roadshows in Singapore and Hong Kong too in February and earlier this month.

The firefighting by the conglomerate comes as it aims to muster up investor confidence that was drained following the US short-seller’s report accusing the group of stock manipulation, accounting fraud and other financial misdeeds.

This round of roadshows comes after Adani saw the first major investment after the Hindenburg fiasco that wiped off billions of dollars of investor money. US boutique investment firm, GQG Partners, bought shares worth Rs 15,446 crore in four Adani Group companies, including Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Green Energy, Adani Enterprises Ltd and Adani Transmission.

Following the investment, eight out of 10 Adani companies, except ACC and Ambuja, were up on Monday.

Rajiv Jain, Chairman of GQG Partners, in an interview explained the rationale behind the buy. He also told The Economic Times in an interview that India right now needs someone who can execute its infrastructure needs, and that the Adani Group is doing just fine. He said that his team also did a lot of due diligence with people who had worked with the Adani Group previously to get an idea of the culture of the place, and felt very comfortable with how the group has done.

As per Kotak Institutional Equities, the sale of 2.5-4.1 per cent stake in the four listed companies should assuage concerns about the group’s ability to raise funding for the repayment of loans. It also stated that the group can potentially raise another $8 billion while maintaining majority control.

Additionally, the conglomerate had organised roadshows in Singapore on February 27, and Hong Kong on February 28 and March 1. Adani reportedly held calls with bondholders earlier this month as it attempted to assuage investor concerns. Barclays, BNP Paribas, DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank, Emirates NBD Capital, ING, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo, MUFG, Mizuho, SMBC Nikko and Standard Chartered Bank organised the company’s Asia roadshow.

PSU bank stocks in for a treat,"The same Adani stocks which led to one of the biggest losses in investors' wealth in February, became the positive factor to drive markets in the initial days of March. All Adani stocks saw the best week with double-digit gains last week for the first time after the Hindenburg report in late January. The reason behind such stellar buying is attributed to foreign funds inflow through a series of block deals in four Adani companies. The mega block deal comes as a sign of comfort among investors in embattled Adani. Does that mean, the latest rally in Adani shares has brought the bulls back to market?

Adani stocks have been under pressure since January 24th after a Hindenburg report accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation, fraud, and tax evasion. While investigations are ongoing in Adani over these allegations, however, the mega block deal seems to have calmed the tide over Adani shares for now.

Last week, GQG Partners which is one of the leading US-based global equity investment boutiques, purchased equity shares of four Adani companies for a whopping ₹15,446 crore in a series of secondary block deals. Other foreign investors have also pumped funds into Adani shares. These four companies are Adani Enterprises, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Ports.

On Friday last week, on BSE, Adani Enterprises stock rose nearly 17%, and Adani Ports was up nearly 10%. While stocks like Adani Transmission, Adani Power, Adani Wilmar, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas hit 5% upper circuit. The NDTV share price soared nearly 5% as well. Meanwhile, ACC was up over 5% and Ambuja Cements surged nearly 6%.

Following the strong rally in Adani stocks, overall markets also saw the best single-day performance for the current year. On Friday, Sensex closed at 59,808.97 up by 899.62 points or 1.53%. While Nifty 50 ended at 17,594.35 higher by 272.45 points or 1.57%. During the trading session, both benchmarks clocked nearly 2% upside each.

Overall, Sensex has climbed 1.3% and the Nifty 50 soared nearly 0.9% between February 27 to March 3rd. Bank Nifty also jumped by 2.3% or 944.25 points. PSU banks saw the most buying after the block deals in Adani firms. Nifty PSU Bank rises over 326 points or nearly 8.95% in the week.

Between February 27 to March 3rd, Adani Enterprises stock gained nearly 44%, Adani Ports jumped over 20%, Adani Green Energy soared over 21.5%, Adani Total Gas jumped over 9%, Adani Power climbed nearly 18%, Adani Wilmar zoomed nearly 17% and Adani Transmission advanced nearly 10%. In cement business, Ambuja Cements stock jumped over 14%, and ACC up nearly 10%. In media business, NDTV rallied by at least 18.5% on BSE.

After markets made robust gains last week on Friday, Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer, Axis Securities said, ""After the near USD 2bn investment by GQG partners in Adani Group, the stock market has heaved a sigh of relief, creating a kind of floor for Adani group stocks since a Marquee investor has invested in them at these prices.""

Kulkarni believes that ""promoters can use the money raised through the transaction to infuse capital in any group company requiring the funds through warrants, rights issues, or any other instrument.""

According to him, this development will also lead to better sentiments for the market and increase retail participation, which was down due to uncertainty.

He further said, ""The investment also leads to a belief that the Adani group stocks have stabilized and can raise capital if they want at current prices.""

He believes this development in Adani firms should support the banks, especially PSU Banks, which were hammered earlier, despite good performance due to fear of their exposure to the Adani group.

Some of the banks that declared their exposure in Adani companies after the Hindenburg report, the majority of them were from PSU banks. These banks were also under pressure post the short seller's allegations against the Adani Group.

In February, SBI stated that they have exposure of ₹27,000 crore in Adani Group which is less than 1% of their total lending book. While Bank of Baroda had revealed that their exposure does not fall under the top 10 of the exposures in Adani, and also stated that around 30% of the bank's exposure is backed by joint ventures with PSU Companies. Further, PNB had mentioned that it has approximately ₹7,000 crore exposure in Adani, of which ₹6,300 crore was funded exposure. Also, PNB has around ₹2,500 crore exposure in the group's airports business.

While Axis Bank had said that its exposure stood at 0.94% of its net advances in Adani Group. Further, the bank revealed that the fund-based exposure was 0.29% and non-fund-based outstanding loan exposure was 0.58%.

Also, IndusInd Bank's exposure in Adani came to around 0.49% of its total book. Further, the largest life insurer in India, LIC also has some exposure to Adani but it is less than 1% of its total book. LIC said, it has ₹35,917 crore under equity and debt at the end of December 2022.

Even DBS Group Holdings revealed they have somewhat $1.3 billion ($976 million) exposure to Adani firms --- of which --- $1 billion is from a cement business acquisition while $300 million is in other Adani firms. It revealed they are not concerned about this exposure in Gautam Adani's firm.

Major rating agencies such as Fitch and Moody's have said earlier in February that Indian banks' exposure in crises-laden Adani is not sufficient to give a substantial risk to these lenders' credit profiles. RBI deputy governor Mahesh Kumar Jain also said in a press conference during the month that domestic banks' exposure in Adani is not very significant.

Has the mega block deal in Adani firms brought bulls back to market?

Kulkarni said, ""We expect the markets to have a short-term bounce back due to increased optimism, but are still concerned about global interest rates and higher valuations, which can lead to increased medium-term volatility.""

He added, ""We advise investors to maintain investment discipline and keep investing regularly in equities for long-term wealth creation, especially if the markets are volatile in the short to medium term.""

Last week, Nirav Karkera, Head of Research, Fisdom told Mint that the recent spurt in Adani stocks needs to sustain for longer before one can distinctly recognize it as either entering a new range, the beginning of a fresh rally, or at least not simply a dead-cat bounce.

Karkera added, ""the stocks still remain highly sensitive to reported developments. Some spurt has been visible on a couple of counters owing to block purchases, but this may not really be an indicator of anything more than the buying entity’s conviction in the company’s growth prospects at the moment.""

GQG Partners who made one of the biggest buying through block deals said, it believes in Adani's long-term growth prospects.

One of the major reasons behind investment in Adani firms, as per Rajiv Jain, Chairman and CIO of GQG Partners, would be that these companies ""own and operate some of the largest and most important infrastructure assets throughout India and around the world.""

Rajiv said, ""We believe that the long-term growth prospects for these companies are substantial, and we are pleased to be investing in companies that will help advance India’s economy and energy infrastructure, including their energy transition over the long run.""

In their latest edition of its ‘Hum Adani Ke Hai Kaun’ series, the Congress questioned the dubious role of Chinese national Chang Chung-Ling in the activities of the Adani Group and his “close association” with Gautam Adani’s brother Vinod Adani.

The Congress alleged that Chang is involved in “smuggling petroleum products to North Korea in violation of UN sanctions”.

The party further said that Chang’s links to the Adani Group are “extremely close”. In 2005, Chang declared the same residential address in Singapore as Vinod Adani.

It added that Chang’s firm Gudami International, which is based in Singapore, was named by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) as part of its probe into the alleged 2013 diamond trading scam involving the Adani Group.

HAHK का आज 23वां दिन है। प्रधानमंत्री से जुड़े अडानी महाघोटाले को लेकर अभी कई और सवाल बाकी हैं।



चुप्पी तोड़िए प्रधानमंत्री जी। pic.twitter.com/jDR6z28dVI — Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) March 6, 2023

“Reportedly, Gudami was named in the first ED chargesheet against the prime accused in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter scam Gautam Khaitan in 2014 and in a supplementary chargesheet against the co-accused Rajiv Saxena in 2017,” said the Congress.

It also alleged that despite all of this, Gudami’s name “mysteriously disappeared from the third ED chargesheet in 2018”.

The Congress party has launched the campaign, ‘Hum Adani Ke Hai Kaun’, in a bid to highlight the Adani Group’s operations and Gautam Adani’s ties to PM Narendra Modi.

In his statement issued addressed to the PM, Ramesh on Monday questioned the alleged ""clean chit to the Adanis' close colleague"" in the AgustaWestland scam.

""Is this why the investigation has lingered for so many years? Are you not concerned that the Adanis maybe involve a Chinese national in important defence contracts"" Ramesh asked in his statement, which was part of a sub-series on the allegations against Adani -- ""Dikh Raha Hai Vinod"".

Also read: Hindenburg alleges Gautam Adani's brother pledged Adani Group promoter stakes for $240-mn loans from Russian bank

Ramesh added that shortly after allegations of corruption appeared, the UPA government took proactive action against AgustaWestland's parent company Finmeccanica (later Leonardo).

""It started a CBI inquiry on February 12, 2013, terminated the helicopter contract on January 1, 2014, and encashed bank guarantees on January 15, 2014, in India and on May 23, 2014 in Italy. Leonardo was barred from future Indian military tenders on August 26, 2014,"" Ramesh said.

He added: ""Yet on November 14, 2021, the government abruptly lifted its ban. Why, with the case still pending, have you lifted the ban on a company accused of bribery and corruption? Are you again trying to facilitate the Adani Group's defence sector activities by misusing government agencies?""

He pointed out that the ban on Leonardo was lifted shortly after PM Modi's October 29, 2021, meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.

He lastly asked: “To pave the way for a successful meeting, you also dropped all the charges against the two Italian Marines accused of killing Indian fishermen. Is your desire for approval by foreign leaders stronger than your desire to investigate corruption in Indian defence deals or to do justice to Indian citizens? Will we now see the Adani Group getting involved in deals with Italian defence companies?”

ICRA revised its outlook on Adani's port arm to 'Negative' from stable, while reaffirming ratings on the company's long-term fund-based and non-fund-based loans, non-convertible debentures, and commercial papers. A similar action was done for the group's joint venture Adani Total Gas as well. The reason behind both of the 'Negative' outlooks is also the same --- deterioration in the group's financial flexibility.

Adani Group's financial flexibility has deteriorated after Hindenburg's report on January 24. The short seller's critical report led to steep declines in share prices and an increase in the yield of international bonds raised by the group's entities.

ICRA took note that the Group’s strong financial flexibility and APSEZL’s track record of refinancing a large part of its debt with borrowings (mostly from overseas debt capital markets) of longer tenures at lower interest rates were the key credit strengths, which have been adversely impacted.

The Moody's-backed rating agency expects an increased risk of regulatory/legal scrutiny on the group entities and its impact on the credit quality of APSEZL will be monitored.

That being said, ICRA will be monitoring the Group’s ability to raise funds from the domestic/global market as equity/debt at competitive rates.

However, ICRA also takes note that Adani Ports' liquidity profile remains robust and a large repayment of the international bond of $650 million is due only in FY2025.

In regards to rating reaffirmation, ICRA's action continues to factor in the strong business profile of APSEZL, marked by its favourable operating characteristics, geographically spread-out footprint, diversified cargo mix, and long-term customer tie-ups.

ICRA said, ""the company has been acquiring key port assets as well as strategic assets across the logistics volume chain in the last few years. This has strengthened its business profile by improving the asset and cargo diversification, expanding presence across key hinterlands in the domestic market, and integrating the port assets with other logistics segment.""

Adani Ports accounted for about ~24% of the overall cargo handled at the Indian ports in FY2022, with around 43% share in the container segment and ~35% share in coal.

ICRA's rating action also takes note of the decline in the share of coal in the overall cargo mix in the last few years, and it is expected to moderate further, going forward.

It said, ""The increased asset and cargo diversification mitigates the risks associated with demand cyclicality in specific cargo segments, structural risks arising from the expected moderation in coal imports in the medium to long term, and any asset specific/event risk at specific locations.""

Further, in its note, ICRA highlighted that the company is undertaking several projects, including a greenfield project at Vizhinjam in Kerala, which has witnessed delays due to various issues, including protests.

While the company is exposed to project execution risks, ICRA said, it "" notes that the impact on the overall credit profile of the company is mitigated by the relatively small size of such projects compared to the overall asset base and net worth. Further, ICRA takes note of the in-principle approval received for viability gap funding (VGF) for the project.""

Although Adani Ports has maintained an aggressive acquisition policy and capex plans in recent years including capex to be incurred for the JV projects, however, in the wake of recent developments, the company has revised its capex plans --- lowering it to ₹4,000-4,500 crore for FY24 from ₹6,000-8,000 crore. Also, the management has guided that the company will be partly prepaying its debt in FY2024 to achieve net debt/OPBDITA of 2.5x.

ICRA said, ""any potential acquisition will keep the leverage guidance into consideration."" It added, ""any significant debt-funded acquisition that will impact the deleveraging plans will be a rating sensitivity.""","After revising its outlook on Adani Total Gas, ICRA has downgraded its outlook on another Adani Group-backed firm and this time it would be Adani Ports.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court asked Sebi to...",2023-03-05 00:00:00,"Adani row: ‘Does SEBI need help from investigative agencies to probe Mauritius funds,’ asks Raghuram Rajan","Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan on Sunday said that it is a matter of concern that markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has not investigated the Hindenburg charges into Adani Group operations.

Addressing the concerns around investigations in the Adani row, Rajan told PTI: ""Why has Sebi not yet got to the bottom of the ownership of those Mauritius funds which have been holding and trading Adani stock? Does it need help from the investigative agencies?”

On what measures the government should take to improve oversight of private family companies to address worries after the Hindenburg allegations on Adani Group, Rajan said: “I don't think the issue is of more oversight over private companies.”

The issue is of reducing non-transparent links between government and business, and of letting, indeed encouraging, regulators do their job, he said.

The Supreme Court on Thursday formed a committee to investigate the Adani-Hindenburg issue. It also asked Sebi to investigate if the Adani group had violated the securities acts and rules and any manipulation in the Adani stocks. Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud said the six-membered expert committee shall be headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre and include KV Kamath and Nandan Nilekani.

It also asked Sebi to suggest measures to strengthen investor awareness.

The apex court asked Sebi to investigate whether there has been a regulatory failure in dealing with the alleged contravention of laws pertaining to the securities market in relation to the Adani Group or other companies.

""To protect Indian investors against the volatility of the kind which has been witnessed in the recent past, we are of the view that it is appropriate to constitute an Expert Committee for the assessment of the extant regulatory framework and for making recommendations to strengthen it,"" CJI said in its order.

Last month, Sebi sought details of all ratings of local loans and securities of Adani group companies from credit rating firms.

The Sebi had asked the rating companies to share the information on Adani Group, which would include all outstanding ratings, outlook, and possible updates from any discussions with officials of the business group.

Sebi has been investigating the relationship between two Mauritius-based funds — The Great International Tusker Fund and Ayushmat Ltd — which participated in Adani Enterprises’ $2.4 billion follow-on public offer.

None of the rating companies in India has changed the ratings or outlook of Adani companies since January 24 when the Wall Street short seller Hindenburg Research released its report alleging price manipulation and accounting fraud by the group. Only international credit agencies, such as S&P and Moody's, have changed the 'outlook' on some of the Adani companies from 'stable' to 'negative', primarily due to the rapid decline in the market value of the companies concerned.

Adani Group stocks have been under pressure since January 24 after a Hindenburg report. In a bid to win back investors’ confidence, Adani Group is holding worldwide roadshows. The company will hold meetings with fixed-income investors from March 7 to 15 in Dubai, London, and the US, according to news reports.

In 2001, the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), a state-government company that used to control all of Gujarat’s ports until a wave of privatisation in the 2000s, leased out an undeveloped piece of land within New Mundra Port Limits to Gujarat Adani Port Ltd (GAPL) for a period of 30 years. The Concession Agreement dated 17 February 2001 provided GAPL with development rights over the land. On 2 June 2004, 34 acres of the said land was further subleased by GAPL to CWC for setting up a warehouse for the storage and handling of foodgrains, notified materials and related activities until 16 February 2031.

On 1 October 2004, CWC set up two warehouses of 33,000MT (metric tonnes) capacity each. It also spent Rs.8.29 crore (just under US $1.5 million) in 2005 towards the development of infrastructure.

Meanwhile, in 2005, India’s Parliament created the concept of ‘special economic zones’, passing the SEZ Act. A notification under the SEZ Act, issued on 23 June 2006 by the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industries created a large area around the Mundra port, including the land on which CWC’s warehouses stood, as an SEZ. Subsequently, the ministry denied multiple requests by the CWC for delineation/denotification of the 34 acres from the SEZ area. Then, on 5 January 2017, Adani Ports (GAPL’s successor company) notified CWC of its intention to take over the land. It told CWC that it would stop issuing gate passes to CWC staffers and vehicles allowing them to enter the SEZ, and CWC was asked to end its warehousing activities on the site.

The Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court on 11 January 2017 provided interim relief to CWC and directed APSEZ to allow CWC to carry out its activities until the next court hearing. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Commerce and Industries rejected another request by the CWC for delineation/denotification on 17 January 2017. A judgement and order passed by the Gujarat High Court on 30 June 2021 gave an undue advantage to APSEZ and was further contested by CWC in the Supreme Court of India.

Contradictions

During settlement talks while the case was still in court, Adani Ports put forward a three-point offer to CWC on 9 March 2019 proposing an alternative location (of 34 acres) in the non-SEZ area of Mundra Industrial Estate where it would construct a warehouse of the existing dimensions. Adani Ports also proposed to underwrite the revenue risks of CWC by taking the warehouse at the new location on rent as per the CWC’s published tariff for the remaining lease period.

The Board of Directors of CWC accepted the proposal in principle on the condition that Adani Ports should sign an agreement giving a suitable bank guarantee for the same. However, after this, Adani Ports unilaterally backed out from the commitment to underwrite the new warehouses, arguing that CWC’s published tariffs were too high. Instead, Adani Ports said, a tariff should be worked out by mutual discussion and should be based on market rates. As an alternative, Adani Ports proposed a one-time monetary settlement.

The Gujarat High Court, while ruling in favour of Adani Ports, tried to force CWC to agree to the first two conditions and asked the parties to reach a compromise regarding the third condition. While the proposal was a composite one where all three conditions were mutually complementary, forcing one party to settle for two while the other retracted from the third was seen by some to be biased decision. The High Court found CWC to be ‘insistent and persistent’, and ‘non-compliant to the law’. The HC accused CWC of acting ‘egoistically’, simply for refusing to settle for a deal not in its interests. It is to be noted that the court used these remarks against a Public Sector Enterprise for not agreeing to the conditions of a private company which was also a beneficiary of the services provided by CWC.

Public vs private

The Central Warehousing Corporation was set up by the Government of India in 1957 for supporting the storage and warehousing needs of the growing agricultural sector. It became a statutory corporation under the Warehousing Corporation Act of 1962 and operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution.

The establishment of CWC was to provide logistic support for agriculture and allied activities. Since then, it has expanded its scope of operations and aided in the efficient implementation of various government programmes. It has been serving several public and private entities with their logistical needs and provides safe storage options across the country.

India has a long history of successfully running public institutions and enterprises for the larger good of the society. Such investments have been made to develop physical and social infrastructure for the better performance of the economy. The Central Warehousing Corporation has served as a lifeline for the agriculture sector, enabling distribution of goods.

Ideally, one would hope that the government and its machinery would stand up to protect public enterprises for the larger social good. It should also be expected that the judiciary ought to take a stand for the common good. However, it appears that the Gujarat HC acted in a partisan way by forcing a statutory body to settle for the conditions put forward by the private company. Ultimately, the Supreme Court found the Gujarat High Court’s decisions as ‘unwarranted’ as there was evidence to prove that the said settlement was leaving CWC worse off.

In 2010, there was a complaint against one of the Directors of the CWC before the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). According to the office memorandum issued by the CVC on 12 January 2010, the presence of CWC in the said area had led to various development activities by other government undertaking such as the Railways and has considerably raised the land value in the area. Shifting the warehouse to a different place would lead to CWC losing business and would result in it struggling with the creation of similar infrastructure facilities from scratch. The commission was of the opinion that GAPL (now Adani Ports) would ‘unduly benefit’ from the deal. The vigilance commission suspected that there may be ‘vested interests’ in the deal that was proposed by Adani Ports, and later forced upon CWC by the Gujarat High Court. Furthermore, it said ‘it is the responsibility of the Department of Commerce to accept the request by CWC for the de-notification of its premises.’

The decision of the Gujarat High Court in favour of APSEZ raises a few questions. It is obvious from the CVC report that settling for the conditions put forward by Adani Ports would not only increase expenditure for the government but would also choke its business and revenue considerably. Why would the Gujarat High Court force a public enterprise to choose a deal that would leave it and the government at a massive loss by way of future costs and loss of business?

Conflicting interests within government

It was asserted to the Supreme Court that the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (Min of C&I) had told the CWC that a proposal for seeking delineation/denotification could not be considered unless it had an unambiguous ‘No Objection Certificate’ from the concerned state government. The repeated requests from CWC, starting in 2015, regarding the delineation/denotification of the 34 acres were refused by the Min of C&I.

The Central Warehousing Corporation is a statutory body under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution (Min of CAF&PD), Government of India. Contrary to the stance of the Min of C&I, the Min of CAF&PD has noted that partial denotification was possible, and has been previously done in an SEZ, citing such an instance in the SEZ at Jamnagar on the initiative of the Developer (Reliance Industries Ltd) at that SEZ. It also observed that Adani Ports had not sought the consent of CWC while submitting the proposal for the notification of the SEZ even though Adani Ports was not in possession of the 34 acres at the time.

Adani Ports had thus resorted to ‘suppression of facts’, potentially a breach of contract, so as to get the larger area notified as a SEZ. While having been an active beneficiary of the warehousing facility of the CWC, Adani Ports claimed that the agreement it had with CWC was null and void for ‘technical reasons’. This was questioned by the CWC in the Supreme Court. With clear violations of contract, the deliberate covering up of facts, and providing misinformation, Adani Ports, a private entity, had tried to disrupt the functioning of a public enterprise. Interestingly, the Min of C&I decided to side with Adani Ports.

The Supreme Court criticised the choosing of ‘diagonally opposite’ stances by two ministries of the Union of India. The contradictory voices of the two departments pointed toward a conflict of interest within the government.

The tussle between the Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), a statutory body under the Ministry of CAF&PD, and Adani Ports, a private company under the ownership of one of the richest men in the country, appears to this writer to be yet another chapter in the saga of systemic destruction of the public sector in the country. The proceedings in the Supreme Court demonstrated to this writer that a major part of the government had been trying to pressure the warehouse corporation to give in to the conditions laid down by the Adani-owned company. The recommendations and directions of the Central Vigilance Commission were not heeded by the government. Unfortunately, the Gujarat High Court also seemed to have compromised views on the matter, a matter of criticism by the Supreme Court.

The case of CWC vs APSEZ appears to be a case of the Union government’s unflinching commitment to the corporate sector at the expense of the public interest. The Supreme Court has put a stop to it in this case. The apex court’s decision sent the matter back to the Gujarat High Court to take a fresh look at the first petition on the subject. It remains to be seen how the case concludes.

Adani Green Energy announced in a press release that it successfully commissioned a 700 megawatt solar-wind hybrid project in the northern state of Rajasthan. The company claims that it is the world’s largest hybrid power project.

The project is located in the Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan. Adani has three other solar-wind hybrid projects in the district with a combined capacity of 1,440 megawatts. The latest project increases its solar-wind hybrid project portfolio to a mammoth 2,140 megawatts, accounting for nearly 27% of the company’s operational capacity.

Adani secured this project through a competitive auction and entered a power purchase agreement for 25 years at a tariff of Rs 3.25 per kilowatt-hour. The project uses bifacial solar modules equipped with single-axis trackers. The company has claimed that the project will deliver power at a capacity utilization factor of at least 50%, making it the most efficient solar or wind power project in India.

Adani’s financial troubles are well known. Adani Green Energy’s shares have collapsed more than 83% from its highs of Rs 3,000 seen in May 2022. There have been unconfirmed reports that the company may slow down capacity addition and could focus on repaying outstanding debt to assuage growing concerns of lenders and investors.

Despite its financial woes, Adani remains the largest and among the most prolific renewable power developers in India. It has a massive pipeline of 20.4 gigawatts with offsets spread across the country.

However, the start of March month has seen hefty buying from FPIs. Between March 1st to March 3, FPIs have pumped in over ₹8,300 crore in equities. The strong buying in the initial days of the current month can be due to large inflows from foreign investors in four Adani firms. Going forward, bond yields are likely to play a spoilsport for foreign funds inflow in domestic equities.

As per NSDL data, FPIs pulled out ₹5,294 crore from equities during the overall February month. While they were net buyers in the debt market with an inflow of ₹2,436 crore this month.

In January month, the outflow stood at ₹28,852 crore from equities.

Meanwhile, in the first three trading sessions of March (1st to 3rd), FPIs have infused a whopping ₹8,939 crore in Indian equities, while their buying in debt instruments have been merely ₹380 crore.

Last week, mega-buying from foreign investors in Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports, and Adani Transmission lifted overall market sentiments. US-based GQG Partners purchased equity shares in these Adani companies for a massive ₹15,446 crore in a series of secondary block deals.

Overall, in the week from February 27 to March 3rd, Indian equities clocked an inflow of ₹6,010.44 crore from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). FIIs sold ₹2,022.52 crore on February 27, while the outflow was at ₹4,559.21 crore on February 28 and ₹424.88 crore on March 1st. However, they made a massive buying of ₹12,770.81 crore on March 2nd followed by another inflow of ₹246.24 crore on March 3rd.

In February month, FIIs sold ₹11,090.64 crore compared to the previous month's outflow of a massive ₹41,464.73 crore, as per Stock Edge data.

Dr.V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said, ""FPIs continued selling in early March too. However, the data ( NSDL) shows a net FPI figure of ₹8902 crores up to 4th March. This discrepancy is due to the US-based investment firm GQG making a massive investment of ₹15446 crores in four Adani stocks.""

However, Vijaykumar also said, ""excluding this, FPIs continued to be sellers to the tune of ₹6544 crores in March till 4th. Excluding the GQG investment, FPIs have sold equity to the tune of ₹41169 crores in 2023.""

Due to strong buying in the last trading session of last week, Sensex's overall weekly performance was up by 1.3% and the Nifty 50 surged by 0.9%. On Friday, after rising by nearly 2% each, Sensex closed at 59,808.97 up by 899.62 points or 1.53% and Nifty 50 ended at 17,594.35 higher by 272.45 points or 1.57%.

Going ahead, Vijayakumar said, ""FIIs are likely to sell at higher levels since the US 10-year bond yield is at 4% and this is an attractive risk-free investment for FPIs. FPIs have been buyers in financials, capital goods, and autos and sellers in Oil & Gas and metals.""

Year-to-date, FPIs are net sellers with an outflow of ₹21,256 crore. This comes after including, an outflow of ₹25,207 crore in Indian equities, ₹1,964 crore in debt-VRR, and ₹431 crore in the hybrid market --- and also adding an inflow of ₹6,347 crore in the debt market.

Zafrullah, also a freedom fighter, made the demand at a press conference organised by Bhasani Anusari Parishad at Gonoshasthaya Nagar Hospital in the capital's Dhanmondi area.

He said local and foreign experts called this deal -- to loot the country's resources in the name of electricity import -- as a gift to the Indian government by the Bangladesh government.

""This deal was mainly inked to fill the pockets of Adani. This is a one-sided and very expensive agreement,"" Zafrullah observed.

In response to a query from Aam Aadmi Party MLA Hemant Ahir, State Energy Minister Kanu Desai told the House that the average cost of power purchased from Adani Power increased by 102 per cent, from Rs 3.58 per unit to Rs 7.24 per unit in 2022.



The price of one unit of Adani Power electricity jumped from Rs 2.83 in January 2021 to Rs 8.83 in December 2022.



Despite the hike in prices, the state government purchased 7.5 per cent more power from Adani Power in 2022 than in 2021. In 2022, the Gujarat government bought 6,007 million units of energy, up from 5,587 million units the previous year.



During these two years (2021-2022), the government paid Rs 8,160 crore to Adani Power which includes fixed charges and per unit cost of power.



This happened even after Adani Power's bids in 2007 enabled the company to sell power for 25 years at prices ranging from Rs 2.89 per unit to Rs 2.35 per unit.



According to the Gujarat government, the Adani Power project was reliant on imported coal from Indonesia, and after 2011, the power producer was unable to generate power at full capacity due to an unanticipated spike in coal prices.



Taking note of this, The state government created a committee on December 1, 2018, and then issued a resolution partially changing the committee's recommendations and approving a rise in electricity rates. This resulted in a supplementary agreement on December 5, 2018 between Adani Power and the government. Furthermore, post the intervention of the Government of India, it was agreed to acquire power at fixed energy charges of Rs 4.5 per unit and capacity charges in accordance with the agreement with the company.



On how the Gujarat government will recover the rising cost of electricity purchased from private producers like Adani Power, KK Bajaj, an expert told Indian Express, “The Government will simply hike the Fuel and Power Purchase Price Adjustment (FPPPA) charges. Though the Gujarat government claims that it has not raised electricity tariff for the past several years, the authorities have been silently hiking the FPPPA charge, which is part of the residential consumer’s bi-monthly electricity bill.”



The state government hiked FPPPA costs at least eight times between 2021 and 2022. The most recent increase occurred in January 2023, after the state Assembly elections. The state government currently charges an FPPPA of Rs 2.85 per unit of energy consumed. In April 2021, the fuel fee was Rs 1.8 per unit.



Adani Group stocks have been under pressure since January 24 after a Hindenburg report. In a bid to win back investors’ confidence, Adani Group is holding worldwide roadshows. The company will hold meetings with fixed-income investors from March 7 to 15 in Dubai, London, and the US, according to news reports.

The reason behind lowering the outlook is due to risks in the financial flexibility of the Group after the Hindenburg report which led to a relentless selloff in these stocks in February. However, the rating actions could not tame the bulls in the majority of Adani stocks. In the week that ended March 10th, except for Adani Enterprises and the cement business, the rest of the Adani-led stocks surged in the week.

On Friday, Adani stocks saw a mixed sentiment. The flagship firm Adani Enterprises stock dropped by nearly 3%, while Adani Wilmar tumbled by at least 4.5%. Adani Ports closed on a flat note. Also, in cement stocks, Ambuja Cements dipped by 2%, and ACC shed nearly a percent. Media stock NDTV was also down by nearly 5%.

On the positive side were Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Green Energy as they touched 5% upper circuit. Adani Power also gained by nearly 5% on BSE.

But by end of March 10th, Adani Group's total market value stood around nearly ₹9.3 lakh crore. This is higher compared to the start of the week.

On March 6th, the group's market value together was near ₹8.85 lakh crore. During the end of February month, the market cap was around ₹6.82 lakh crore.

From March 6th to 10th, Adani Enterprises' stock plunged by nearly 4.4% on BSE. While Ambuja and ACC stocks dipped by nearly 2% and 1% respectively.

Rest all have recorded an upside!

In the week, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Green Energy posted a nearly 16% surge each in their stock prices on BSE. Their market cap also regained over ₹1 lakh crore mark.

Also, Adani Power climbed by over 15% during the week. While Adani Ports and NDTV stock jumped over a percent. Lastly, Adani Wilmar climbed over 3%.

As of March 10, 2023, Adani Enterprises' m-cap is around ₹2,16,195.51 crore, while Adani Ports' m-cap stood at ₹1,50,745.3 crore. These two are the most valued firms of the Adani Group in terms of market share.

Further, Adani Transmission's m-cap is currently at ₹1,00,823.81 crore, Adani Total Gas at ₹1,04,498.46 crore, and Adani Green Energy at ₹1,08,197.34 crore. Also, Adani Power's m-cap is at ₹79,163.67 crore, Adani Wilmar's at ₹58,914.43 crore, Ambuja at ₹75,126.89 crore, ACC at ₹34,687.12 crore, and NDTV at ₹1,507.02 crore.

Moody's-backed ICRA was among the first to trim its outlook to Negative on two Adani companies on March 3rd. These were Adani Ports and Adani Total Gas. Earlier, their outlook was stable. However, ICRA reaffirmed its rating.

According to ICRA, the reason behind the lowering in the outlook of these two Adani companies was due to a deterioration in the group's financial flexibility.

Adani Group's financial flexibility has deteriorated after Hindenburg's report on January 24. The short seller's critical report led to steep declines in share prices and an increase in the yield of international bonds raised by the group's entities.

While last week, India Ratings also assigned a Negative outlook on Adani Green Energy and Adani Enterprises from their previous 'Stable'. Also, CARE Edge trimmed its outlook to Negative on Adani Enterprises.

In regards to Adani Enterprises, Ind-Ra's negative outlook on the company is due to the uncertainty on the cash flow mismatches resulting from the revised capex plans and the possible sources of funding available which may keep the equity cover lower than 2x.

While CARE Edge's rating action on Adani's flagship company was due to the expected moderation in the financial flexibility of the Adani group in case of any adverse outcome or observations from the ongoing regulatory and legal scrutiny directed by the Honourable Supreme Court of India in connection with various allegations against the Adani group of companies.

After the apex court's direction, market regulator Sebi is expected to complete the examination pertaining to the lapses in reporting mechanisms, disclosure adequacies, and manipulation of stock prices amidst other aspects of investigation in a time-bound manner.

However, both Ind-Ra and CARE believe that the latest fundraising of ₹15,446 crore from GQG Partners alleviates the risk to some extent in these companies and could aid in liquidity to a certain degree.

Meanwhile, the cement stocks were under pressure after a report stated that Gautam Adani, the chairperson of the Adani Group, is planning to sell a stake in the cement business for $450 million with the aim to reduce debt. Adani is looking to sell a 4-5% stake in Ambuja Cement to international lenders, reported Financial Times quoting sources.

Overall, Adani stocks were in the green due to the mega block deal by GQG Partners which sort of brings some comfort among investors.","The flagship firm Adani Enterprises stock dropped by nearly 3%, while Adani Wilmar tumbled by at least 4.5%.

Shares of...,2023-03-09 00:00:00,Adani Enterprises shares snap six-day gaining streak; here’s why,"Shares of Adani Group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd fell after six consecutive sessions of gains today after CARE Ratings downgraded the outlook on Gautam Adani's flagship entity from stable to negative while considering the ongoing regulatory and legal scrutiny. India Ratings too has downgraded the outlook on Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) along with Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL) from “stable” to “negative” while affirming the long-term issuer rating for both at “A+”.

The ratings agency said AEL's negative outlook reflects uncertainty about cash flow mismatches resulting from the revised capex plans and the possible sources of funding available which may keep the equity cover lower than 2x. Adani Enterprises plans to raise up to Rs 1,000 crore via non-convertible debentures (NCDs).

Adani Enterprises shares slipped up to 6.66% to Rs 1903.85 against the previous close of Rs 2039.65 on BSE. Later, Adani Enterprises shares closed 4.24% lower at Rs 1953. Earlier, the stock opened higher at Rs 2044.10 on BSE.

The stock is down 49.39 per cent this year. In a year, the Adani Enterprises stock has risen 18%. Adani Enterprises’ market cap slipped to Rs 2.22 lakh crore in the current session. Total 13.33 lakh shares changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 262.66 crore on BSE.

In terms of technicals, the relative strength index (RSI) of Adani Enterprises stands at 52.4, signaling it's trading neither in the overbought nor in the oversold zone. Adani Enterprises stock has a one-year beta of 1.8, indicating very high volatility during the period. Adani Enterprises shares stand higher than the 5 day and 20 day moving averages but lower than 50 day, 100 day and 200 day moving averages.

The stock hit a 52 week high of Rs 4189.55 on December 21, 2022 and a 52 week low of Rs 1017.10 on February 3, 2023. At the current level, the stock is down 53.39% from its yearly high.

""The negative outlook is due to expected moderation in financial flexibility of the Adani Group in case of any adverse outcome or observations in on-going regulatory and legal scrutiny directed by Honourable Supreme Court of India in connection with various allegations against Adani group companies,"" CARE said in a report.

Conversely, if the outcome is satisfactory, then the financial flexibility of the Adani group may be restored and may lead to a revision of outlook to stable.

Any adverse outcome or observation on corporate governance practices shall impair the Adani group’s access to capital, both debt and equity at envisaged rates or quantum, and are viewed as potential downside risks and thus continue to be key rating monitorable, the ratings agency said.

CARE said the company's strengths continue to be tempered by the incubation risk associated with large-sized projects in diverse areas wherein AEL does not possess prior experience, large capex envisaged in the airport segment and continued dependence on subcontractors for road project execution.

“Besides, the inherent regulatory risk with respect to the timely receipt of tariff order in the airports segment and traffic risk in the toll roads projects are continued rating weaknesses. Volatility in commodity price movements, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and working capital intensive nature of operations for coal trading, solar module manufacturing and mining services segment respectively are other credit weaknesses,” it added.

The Hindenburg Research report that jolted the Adani Group’s fortunes and future plans came on January 24 just before Adani Enterprises’ Rs 20,000 crore follow-on-public offer (FPO) opened. The Hindenburg report accused the Adani Group of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

The Adani Group has denied Hindenburg’s allegations as being “malicious”, “baseless”, and a “calculated attack on India.”

The exchanges had also put NDTV and Adani Green Energy under the long term ASM framework Stage - II.

Interestingly, on Monday, the bourses announced that Adani Enterprises, the flagship firm of Adani Group, will move out of the short-term ASM framework from 8 March.

Earlier in February, both the NSE and BSE had put three Adani Group firms under the short-term ASM framework to curb volatility induced in the counters due to an US-based short seller Hindenburg's explosive report against the empire.

The parameters for shortlisting securities under ASM include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close to close price variation and price earning ratio.

The NSE and BSE said these companies have satisfied the criteria for inclusion under long term additional surveillance measures (Long Term - ASM).

March 12 (Reuters) - Adani Group said it had completed full prepayment of margin-linked share-backed financing worth $2.15 billion as part of its debt prepayment plan, before its deadline of March 31.

The Gautam Adani-owned conglomerate also prepaid a $500 million facility it had taken for Ambuja acquisition financing, it said in a statement on Sunday, adding that the payment comes in continuation of promoters' commitment to repay the leverage.

""This is in line with promoters' commitment to increase (the) equity contribution and promoters have now infused $2.6 billion out of (a) total acquisition value of $6.6 billion for Ambuja (ABUJ.NS) and ACC (ACC.NS),"" the statement said.

Adani Group last year acquired Holcim AG's (HOLN.S) cement businesses in India – Ambuja Cements and ACC Ltd – for $10.5 billion, its largest-ever acquisition.

Adani's latest move comes as the group seeks to rebuild investor confidence and allay concerns about its debt by pre-paying loans in the aftermath of a scathing report by U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research.

Hindenburg's report alleged stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens, and flagged ""substantial"" debt levels, which the group has denied.

The reason behind lowering the outlook is due to risks in the financial flexibility of the Group after the Hindenburg report which led to a relentless selloff in these stocks in February. However, the rating actions could not tame the bulls in the majority of Adani stocks. In the week that ended March 10th, except for Adani Enterprises and the cement business, the rest of the Adani-led stocks surged in the week.

On Friday, Adani stocks saw a mixed sentiment. The flagship firm Adani Enterprises stock dropped by nearly 3%, while Adani Wilmar tumbled by at least 4.5%. Adani Ports closed on a flat note. Also, in cement stocks, Ambuja Cements dipped by 2%, and ACC shed nearly a percent. Media stock NDTV was also down by nearly 5%.

On the positive side were Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Green Energy as they touched 5% upper circuit. Adani Power also gained by nearly 5% on BSE.

But by end of March 10th, Adani Group's total market value stood around nearly ₹9.3 lakh crore. This is higher compared to the start of the week.

On March 6th, the group's market value together was near ₹8.85 lakh crore. During the end of February month, the market cap was around ₹6.82 lakh crore.

From March 6th to 10th, Adani Enterprises' stock plunged by nearly 4.4% on BSE. While Ambuja and ACC stocks dipped by nearly 2% and 1% respectively.

Rest all have recorded an upside!

In the week, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Green Energy posted a nearly 16% surge each in their stock prices on BSE. Their market cap also regained over ₹1 lakh crore mark.

Also, Adani Power climbed by over 15% during the week. While Adani Ports and NDTV stock jumped over a percent. Lastly, Adani Wilmar climbed over 3%.

As of March 10, 2023, Adani Enterprises' m-cap is around ₹2,16,195.51 crore, while Adani Ports' m-cap stood at ₹1,50,745.3 crore. These two are the most valued firms of the Adani Group in terms of market share.

Further, Adani Transmission's m-cap is currently at ₹1,00,823.81 crore, Adani Total Gas at ₹1,04,498.46 crore, and Adani Green Energy at ₹1,08,197.34 crore. Also, Adani Power's m-cap is at ₹79,163.67 crore, Adani Wilmar's at ₹58,914.43 crore, Ambuja at ₹75,126.89 crore, ACC at ₹34,687.12 crore, and NDTV at ₹1,507.02 crore.

Moody's-backed ICRA was among the first to trim its outlook to Negative on two Adani companies on March 3rd. These were Adani Ports and Adani Total Gas. Earlier, their outlook was stable. However, ICRA reaffirmed its rating.

According to ICRA, the reason behind the lowering in the outlook of these two Adani companies was due to a deterioration in the group's financial flexibility.

Adani Group's financial flexibility has deteriorated after Hindenburg's report on January 24. The short seller's critical report led to steep declines in share prices and an increase in the yield of international bonds raised by the group's entities.

While last week, India Ratings also assigned a Negative outlook on Adani Green Energy and Adani Enterprises from their previous 'Stable'. Also, CARE Edge trimmed its outlook to Negative on Adani Enterprises.

In regards to Adani Enterprises, Ind-Ra's negative outlook on the company is due to the uncertainty on the cash flow mismatches resulting from the revised capex plans and the possible sources of funding available which may keep the equity cover lower than 2x.

While CARE Edge's rating action on Adani's flagship company was due to the expected moderation in the financial flexibility of the Adani group in case of any adverse outcome or observations from the ongoing regulatory and legal scrutiny directed by the Honourable Supreme Court of India in connection with various allegations against the Adani group of companies.

After the apex court's direction, market regulator Sebi is expected to complete the examination pertaining to the lapses in reporting mechanisms, disclosure adequacies, and manipulation of stock prices amidst other aspects of investigation in a time-bound manner.

However, both Ind-Ra and CARE believe that the latest fundraising of ₹15,446 crore from GQG Partners alleviates the risk to some extent in these companies and could aid in liquidity to a certain degree.

Meanwhile, the cement stocks were under pressure after a report stated that Gautam Adani, the chairperson of the Adani Group, is planning to sell a stake in the cement business for $450 million with the aim to reduce debt. Adani is looking to sell a 4-5% stake in Ambuja Cement to international lenders, reported Financial Times quoting sources.

Overall, Adani stocks were in the green due to the mega block deal by GQG Partners which sort of brings some comfort among investors.","The flagship firm Adani Enterprises stock dropped by nearly 3%, while Adani Wilmar tumbled by at least 4.5%.

Total 13.33 lakh shares changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 262.66 crore on BSE. Shares of...,2023-03-09 00:00:00,Adani Enterprises shares snap six-day gaining streak; here’s why,"Shares of Adani Group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd fell after six consecutive sessions of gains today after CARE Ratings downgraded the outlook on Gautam Adani's flagship entity from stable to negative while considering the ongoing regulatory and legal scrutiny. India Ratings too has downgraded the outlook on Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) along with Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL) from “stable” to “negative” while affirming the long-term issuer rating for both at “A+”.

The ratings agency said AEL's negative outlook reflects uncertainty about cash flow mismatches resulting from the revised capex plans and the possible sources of funding available which may keep the equity cover lower than 2x. Adani Enterprises plans to raise up to Rs 1,000 crore via non-convertible debentures (NCDs).

Adani Enterprises shares slipped up to 6.66% to Rs 1903.85 against the previous close of Rs 2039.65 on BSE. Later, Adani Enterprises shares closed 4.24% lower at Rs 1953. Earlier, the stock opened higher at Rs 2044.10 on BSE.

The stock is down 49.39 per cent this year. In a year, the Adani Enterprises stock has risen 18%. Adani Enterprises’ market cap slipped to Rs 2.22 lakh crore in the current session. Total 13.33 lakh shares changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 262.66 crore on BSE.

In terms of technicals, the relative strength index (RSI) of Adani Enterprises stands at 52.4, signaling it's trading neither in the overbought nor in the oversold zone. Adani Enterprises stock has a one-year beta of 1.8, indicating very high volatility during the period. Adani Enterprises shares stand higher than the 5 day and 20 day moving averages but lower than 50 day, 100 day and 200 day moving averages.

The stock hit a 52 week high of Rs 4189.55 on December 21, 2022 and a 52 week low of Rs 1017.10 on February 3, 2023. At the current level, the stock is down 53.39% from its yearly high.

""The negative outlook is due to expected moderation in financial flexibility of the Adani Group in case of any adverse outcome or observations in on-going regulatory and legal scrutiny directed by Honourable Supreme Court of India in connection with various allegations against Adani group companies,"" CARE said in a report.

Conversely, if the outcome is satisfactory, then the financial flexibility of the Adani group may be restored and may lead to a revision of outlook to stable.

Any adverse outcome or observation on corporate governance practices shall impair the Adani group’s access to capital, both debt and equity at envisaged rates or quantum, and are viewed as potential downside risks and thus continue to be key rating monitorable, the ratings agency said.

CARE said the company's strengths continue to be tempered by the incubation risk associated with large-sized projects in diverse areas wherein AEL does not possess prior experience, large capex envisaged in the airport segment and continued dependence on subcontractors for road project execution.

“Besides, the inherent regulatory risk with respect to the timely receipt of tariff order in the airports segment and traffic risk in the toll roads projects are continued rating weaknesses. Volatility in commodity price movements, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and working capital intensive nature of operations for coal trading, solar module manufacturing and mining services segment respectively are other credit weaknesses,” it added.

The Hindenburg Research report that jolted the Adani Group’s fortunes and future plans came on January 24 just before Adani Enterprises’ Rs 20,000 crore follow-on-public offer (FPO) opened. The Hindenburg report accused the Adani Group of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

The Adani Group has denied Hindenburg’s allegations as being “malicious”, “baseless”, and a “calculated attack on India.”

Interestingly, on Monday, the bourses announced that Adani Enterprises, the flagship firm of Adani Group, will move out of the short-term ASM framework from 8 March.

Earlier in February, both the NSE and BSE had put three Adani Group firms under the short-term ASM framework to curb volatility induced in the counters due to an US-based short seller Hindenburg's explosive report against the empire.

The parameters for shortlisting securities under ASM include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close to close price variation and price earning ratio.

The NSE and BSE said these companies have satisfied the criteria for inclusion under long term additional surveillance measures (Long Term - ASM).

The opposition parties will meet on Monday morning to evolve their strategy in both Houses of Parliament after protests by them on the Hindenburg-Adani issue overshadowed most of the first half of the Budget session.

Congress leader K Suresh maintained that his party would continue to demand answers from the government on the Adani-Hindenburg issue as it has been keeping a studied silence.

The principal opposition party has been pressing for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe.

The opposition parties are also likely to vociferously raise the issue of recent raids by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against opposition leaders, some of whom were questioned and even arrested in various cases.

They have accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre of misusing the central agencies to target leaders of the BJP's rival parties.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjunram Meghwal told PTI on Sunday that the top-most priority for the government is the passage of the Financial Bill.

He said discussions will be held on demands for grants of ministries including Railways, Panchayati Raj, Tourism, Culture and Health.

Speaker Om Birla will later apply the guillotine, after which all the outstanding demands for grants, whether discussed or not, will be put to vote and passed.

""Then we will get the Finance Bill passed. After that we'll look into the demands of the Opposition... the first responsibility of the government is to get the Finance Bill passed. Then we will hold discussions on issues the Opposition's demands,"" he said.

The session, which began on January 31, is likely to conclude on April 6.

Parliament is meeting after a month-long recess which allows various parliamentary panels to scrutinise allocations made in the Union Budget for different ministries.

On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present Supplementary Demands for Grants -- Second Batch for 2022-23.

She will also table the budget for the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir for the year 2023-24 in Lok Sabha. The UT is at present under central rule.

The two items are listed in the order paper of Lok Sabha for Monday.

Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge had on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of making 'sinister attempts to kill democracy' by misusing probe agencies against opposition leaders, as he slammed the Centre over the ED searches on the premises of former Bihar Chief Minister Yadav's family.

The Samajwadi Party, the Left and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam were among those who protested against the alleged attack on the federal structure and the 'misuse' of institutions.

The Trinamool Congress will raise in Parliament issues such as LIC and SBI's risk exposure, price rise of essential commodities, unemployment and 'misuse' of central agencies during the second phase of the session, its Rajya Sabha floor leader Derek O'Brien had recently said.

He said LIC's risk exposure and price rise affect the lives of the common man and their savings and should be highlighted.

The Trinamool Congress will also raise the issue of 'political vendetta' against non-BJP ruled states in Parliament and also question the Union government on 'holding back of funds for schemes such as MNREGA', O'Brien said.

The Adani-Hindenburg issue had rocked the first leg of Parliament's Budget Session which saw multiple disruptions after the Congress and other opposition parties pressed for a JPC probe.

Having global private roadshows for investors is pointless. Just come out with the truth. — Mahua Moitra (@MahuaMoitra) March 10, 2023

A Bloomberg report said Adani Group's executives told investors in London that chairman Gautam Adani and his family have prepaid all borrowings backed by his conglomerate's shares.

The investor meeting was part of a worldwide roadshow launched by the conglomerate aimed at reassuring investors that the conglomerate's finances are under control.

Adani Group has lined up roadshows in several American cities till March 15 as part of its efforts to rebuild investor confidence.

Mahua Moitra, on Thursday, accused Adani Group of ""classic deception"" for creating fresh share pledges in two firms, especially after it claimed to have told its investors that all share-backed loans have been paid back.

Moitra, who has been accusing Adani Group of various corporate violations ever since US short seller Hindenburg Research accused it of share manipulation and illegal use of tax havens, asked how market regulator Sebi could be okay with Adani's claims and actions within the span of a few hours.

The Congress, quoting the recent interview of Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry with The Hindu, asked the Narendra Modi government on March 10 to explain the basis on which it identified the Adani Group for a “government-to-government” port project in Sri Lanka.

As part of its ongoing Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun (HAHK), Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed three fresh questions to Prime Minister Modi and accused his government of “lobbying” in favour of the Adani Group for projects in Sri Lanka.

“Parliament resumes on March 13. We are preparing for our interventions to be expunged. But what cannot be erased out is ‘ Hum Adanike Hain Kaun’-26 bringing the total of direct questions of the PM so far to 78,” Mr. Ramesh tweeted.

13 मार्च को संसद फिर शुरू होगी।हम जनहित के सवाल पूछना जारी रखेंगे।हो सकता है उन्हें भी रिकॉर्ड से हटा दिया जाए,लेकिन जिन्हें हटाया या मिटाया नहीं जा सकता,वो हैं ""HAHK-हम अडानी के हैं कौन"" श्रृंखला के तहत PM से पूछे गए सवाल,जिनकी संख्या 78 हो गई है।

In a statement, Mr. Ramesh said the governments of India, Japan and Sri Lanka (then headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe) had signed a memorandum on May 28, 2019 to develop the East Container Terminal in the Colombo South port. A year later, on June 9, 2020, the Sri Lankan cabinet headed by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa announced that India had “selected” Adani Ports as its foreign terminal operator, he added.

However, following the unexpected cancellation of the deal, the Rajapaksa government offered Colombo’s West Container Terminal to India and Japan under a 35-year build, operate and transfer lease, which was finalised on September 30, 2021.

“A Sri Lankan Cabinet spokesperson said that India had ‘nominated’ Adani Ports as the partner. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry described it as a ‘government-to-government’ port project in a March 5, 2023 interview,” Mr. Ramesh said, quoting The Hindu interview.

“On what basis did you ‘select’ and ‘nominate’ Adani Ports for this government-to-government deal? Did any other Indian firms have the opportunity to consider investing or did you simply reserve the deal for your close friends?” asked the Congress communication chief in an open letter to the Prime Minister.

Stating that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government’s 2002 decision not to invest in the strategic Hambantota Port cleared the path for Chinese firms to enter Sri Lanka’s ports sector, the Congress leader said India’s investment in Colombo now is partly driven by the need to counter China’s expansion.

“However, as we pointed out on March 3, 2023, the Adani Group has disturbing connections with Chinese nationals such as the Adani family confidant Chang Chung-Ling (aka Lingo-Chang) who has been involved, among other things, in violating UN sanctions against China’s and Pakistan’s ally North Korea,” he said, asking if these connections were not worthy of a probe by the Central investigative agencies.

Mr. Ramesh charged the Prime Minister of indulging in “hectic lobbying for his cronies”, including for a 500-megawatt wind power project in Sri Lanka’s Mannar district.

“The former head of the Ceylon Electricity Board, MMC Ferdinando, testified on June 10, 2022 before the Parliament of Sri Lanka that on October 24, 2021, ‘the President [Gotabaya Rajapaksa] summoned me after a meeting and said that India’s Prime Minister Modi is pressuring him to hand over the project to the Adani Group’. Although he retracted the comments under pressure, Ferdinando’s remarks had completely exposed the nexus of crony capitalism in which you are enmeshed,” the Congress leader alleged.","As part of its ongoing Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun (HAHK), Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed three fresh questions to Prime Minister Modi and accused his government of “lobbying” in favour of the Adani Group for projects in Sri Lanka.

As of now, the month has recorded seven trading sessions and these days FPIs pumped in ₹13,540 crore in Indian equities. This includes the mega block deal in four companies of the Adani Group. Going ahead, FPIs are expected to likely hold a cautious tone in their approach to the market due to the crisis in Silicon Valley Bank.

As per NSDL data, FPIs infused ₹13,540 crore in Indian equities from March 1st to 10th.

Trading in the Indian market was held between March 1-3, March 6th, and then March 8-10. Markets were closed on March 4-5 due to the weekend, and on March 7th owing to the Holi festival.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are net buyers so far in March. As of now, the month has recorded seven trading sessions and these days FPIs pumped in ₹13,540 crore in Indian equities.

As per NSDL data, FPIs infused ₹13,540 crore in Indian equities from March 1st to 10th.

Trading in the Indian market was held between March 1-3, March 6th, and then March 8-10. Markets were closed on March 4-5 due to the weekend, and on March 7th owing to the Holi festival.

It is most likely that the majority of the buying from FPIs came between March 1st to 3rd after the mega block deal in Adani companies. In the week that ended March 3rd, NSDL data showed that FPIs infused ₹8,939 crore in the equities.

During that week, mega-buying from foreign investors in Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports, and Adani Transmission lifted overall market sentiments. US-based GQG Partners purchased equity shares in these Adani companies for a massive ₹15,446 crore in a series of secondary block deals.

Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said, ""FPIs have invested ₹13586 crores through exchanges in the Indian market through 10th March 2023. But this is inclusive of the bulk investment of ₹15446 crores by GQG in the four Adani stocks. So the net of bulk deals FPIs continued to sell in India, so far in March too, even though the intensity of selling has subsided.""

Year-to-date, FPIs are net sellers in domestic equities with an outflow of ₹20,606 crore.

Coming to foreign institutional investors (FIIs), are also net buyers with an inflow of ₹6,929.35 crore in Indian equities, as per Stock Edge data.

Between March 6th to 10th, FIIs bought ₹1,211.97 crore. While from February 27th to March 3rd week, FIIs inflow stood at ₹6,010.44 crore.

Last week, Sensex dropped by 671.15 points or 1.12% to end at 59,135.13. While Nifty 50 plunged by 172.85 points or 0.98% to close at 17,416.75 on Friday. Between March 6th to 10th, overall, Sensex dipped by nearly 310 points or 0.52%, while Nifty 50 tumbled by 54.40 points or 0.31%.

At the interbank forex market, the rupee closed the week at a broadly subdued level compared to the previous week. The currency managed to escape the steep losses in Asian peers that occurred due to the strengthening in the dollar index on rate hike fears. On Friday, the rupee closed at 82.04 per dollar --- compared to the previous day's print of 81.9750. For the week, the rupee ranged between 81.60 to 82.30 -- and closed overall with just a 0.1% upside.

Explaining the trend in FPIs further, Vijayakumar said, an important feature of FPI activity is that there is no consistency in FPI activity. For instance, FPIs were buyers in the first half of February in financial services and sellers in the second half. Similarly, they were buyers in IT in the first half and sellers in the second half. In oil and gas, they were sellers in the first half and buyers in the second half. All data relates to February. This shows that their activity was not in response to the performance or prospects of these sectors.

However, he also said, a consistent trend is FPIs have been buyers of capital goods stocks. This explains the strength of the capital goods segment even in a weak market.

Going ahead, Vijayakumar said, ""the collapse of the SVB Bank in the US has impacted sentiments in the market. So, FPIs are likely to be cautious in their approach in the coming days.""

The Gautam Adani-led conglomerate has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Posing a set of three questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of the party's ''Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun'' series, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said Thursday's questions related to the ''hard work'' the Modi government had put into ''handing over'' India's food grain logistics to the Adani Group.

''A lap of honour around the stadium he got named after himself in his own lifetime is a good occasion for heralding a quarter century of pointed questions with 'Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun'. Chuppi Todiye Pradhan Mantriji,'' Ramesh tweeted, referring to the presence of Prime Minister Modi and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese during a Test cricket match between India and Australia in Ahmedabad.

He alleged that the ''conspiracy'' seems to have been only temporarily foiled by the farmers' agitation of 2020-21 that forced the government to withdraw the ''black farm laws''.

''The publication 'AdaniWatch' has reported that on October 13, 2022, the Supreme Court of India quashed a June 30, 2021 Gujarat High Court judgement that favoured Adani Ports and SEZ over the government-owned Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), and said that the High Court judgement 'is not sustainable in law','' Ramesh claimed.

The corporation was set up in 1957 to support India's food storage needs and stored 55 lakh tonnes of food grains in 2021-22, he said.

''The Supreme Court observed that the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had supported the CWC's stand while the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had aided Adani's bid to take control of two major CWC warehouses near Mundra port by not supporting the denotification of the warehouses as part of the Adani SEZ,'' he claimed, citing the publication.

''The judgement stated that 'it does not augur well for the Union of India to speak in two contradictory voices' and that 'two departments of the Union of India cannot be permitted to take stands which are diagonally opposite','' Ramesh said.

Why did the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, then headed by Nirmala Sitharaman, took a stand opposed to a strategic public-sector corporation and in support of the prime minister's ''favourite business group'', Ramesh asked.

''Would she have the courage to do so without clear directions from above?'' he said.

''This Adani-inspired inter-ministerial conflict was allowed to continue even after Piyush Goyal became Minister of Commerce and Industry (in May 2019) as well as Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution (in October 2020). If a minister considered close to corporate interests does not take the initiative to support a public-sector unit that he is responsible for, is it not logical to assume that he is instead supporting the Adani Group to build a strong 'electoral bond' with it?'' Ramesh said.

Ramesh alleged that the entire country knows that the motivation behind the ''ill-conceived'' farm laws was to ''hand over'' India's agricultural logistics to a few ''close corporate cronies'' of the prime minister.

''One of the biggest beneficiaries of the farm laws would have been Adani Agri Logistics which has become the major beneficiary of the Food Corporation of India’s silo contracts, the most recent award being one to set up 3.5 lakh metric tonnes of storage in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,'' he claimed.

Meanwhile, Adani Farm-Pik was allowed to build a near-monopoly on apple procurement in Himachal Pradesh, he alleged.

Is India's public sector, painstakingly built over the past 70 years, now reduced to being a vehicle for the enrichment of the prime minister's ''corporate friends'', he asked.

Ramesh urged the prime minister to break his ''silence'' on the issue.

Paritosh Kashyap, president and head for wholesale banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank, told PTI that the issues surrounding Adani Group are more of a ""capital market and valuations issue and not a credit issue"".

""We have a small exposure to the group. We do business with every corporate in the country, and our exposures are in line with our credit philosophy and the size of our balance sheet,"" Kashyap said.

He added that operating companies in the group have ""reasonable leverage"", coupled with strong profitability and balance sheets.

The embattled conglomerate has been under surveillance by different government bodies after US short seller Hindenburg Research in a scathing report noted that the conglomerate is misusing tax havens and accused it of financial misdeeds, accounting fraud and stock manipulation. It also said that the stocks are overvalued by 85 per cent.

The report, which was published on January 24, led to a massive rout in Adani Group's listed companies’ stocks, which made investors nervous.

Kashyap of Kotak Mahindra Bank said the overall wholesale banking book is bereft of any stress for Kotak Mahindra Bank and also expressed concerns about the lack of any stress emerging for over seven years now.

""As a segment, I can't say anyone which has a stress,"" he said, adding that the bank is open to doing business with segments like infrastructure, real estate and lending to non-banks, which is otherwise considered as prone to stress.

The Adani Group, which has companies in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and ports, has been the subject of scrutiny by investors following the rout. This is mainly due to concerns over the Group's high leverage and its impact on the banking sector, and government-owned financial institutions like the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India. A CLSA recent report has highlighted that 39-40 per cent of the company's debt, which is close to Rs 2 lakh cr, is from the Indian banking sector from PSUs to private banks.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has launched a special examination of the banking system's exposures to Adani Group entities, and Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that a single case cannot impact the broader banking system.

According to experts, the Indian banks' exposures are to operative companies and not against shares at the listed holding company level. This is so because in most cases barring asset buys by infrastructure companies, Indian banks are not allowed to lend more than Rs 20 lakh as loans against shares, which has come in as a helpful regulatory mandate.

Earlier, the country’s biggest lender State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda, and Life Insurance Corporation had clarified their exposures and assured investors that the debts are well in order.

Last month, SBI said its overall exposure to Adani Group is about 0.9 per cent of its total loan book, which was about Rs 27,000 crore, and it has not extended any loan against shares to the group.

Insurance behemoth LIC also came out with its stand. It said its overall exposure is over Rs 35,000 crore, with a large part of it being in equity investments which have suffered alongside the rout in stocks, and some reports pegging the valuations dipping below the purchase price as well.

The insurance major has invested in seven of 10 listed companies of the Adani Group. As of December 2022, LIC held 9.14 per cent in Adani Ports; 5.96 per cent in Adani Total Gas; 4.23 per cent in Adani Enterprises; 3.65 per cent in Adani Transmission; and 1.28 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

Since the report was made public, LIC's exposure to Adani group firms' stock has come under scrutiny. The group, after the report was out, said the total purchase value of equity, purchased over the last many years, under all the Adani Group companies was over Rs 36,000 crore and the market value as on January 27 was Rs 56,142 crore.

In mid-February, the state-run insurance company lost nearly Rs 50,000 crore on its investments in the Adani Group stocks. The combined market value of its investments in seven Adani stocks - Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission, Ambuja Cements and ACC - plunged to Rs 33,242 crore as on February 23 from Rs 82,970 crore as on December 31, 2022.

On February 27, shares of LIC hit their 52-week low level of Rs 566 against a previous close of Rs 584.65. The weakness in Adani stocks and deep erosion in m-cap got reflected on the LIC counter as well.

Bank of Baroda had said the public lender has ""absolutely no concern"" about its exposure to tumult-hit Adani Group. After announcing December quarter results, the banks said its exposure to Adani Group is one fourth of the large exposure framework of RBI. It said that 30 per cent of total exposure to Adani Group is a joint venture with public sector companies.

Debt repayment

As per reports, Gautam Adani and his family have prepaid all borrowings backed by his conglomerate Adani Group's shares. A Bloomberg report said company executives told investors at a meeting in London that all borrowings have been prepaid.

The investor meeting was part of a worldwide roadshow launched by the conglomerate aimed at reassuring investors that the conglomerate's finances are under control, the report said. Another Bloomberg report said the Adani group has repaid a $500 million bridge loan that was due Thursday.

Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Sabry recently told The Hindu’s Suhasini Haidar that the Adani project in Sri Lanka “is like a government-to-government deal.” He went on to say that it was the Indian government that “identified the Adani Group for infrastructure projects including Northern Sri Lanka wind power project.”

Apart from the renewable energy projects in northern Sri Lanka, the Adani Group is also involved in the development of the U.S. $700-million West Container Terminal (WCT) project at the Colombo Port.

Ali Sabry added that his government is also “very, very confident” that the Adani Group has the necessary funding to finalize these projects despite the conglomerate losing over $145 billion in one month following a critical report by investment research firm Hindenburg Research LLC.

“So, we are not panicking at all. And we are very, very confident they will be able to complete the project. And this will become a precursor for much more investment to come from so many diverse investment institutions in India. So, we are definitely not worried,” Sabry said.

The Sri Lankan foreign minister’s interview seems to confirm speculations about the special treatment that the Adani Group received in Sri Lanka in recent years, allegedly due to the pressure exerted by the Indian government on its Sri Lankan counterpart.

The Adani Group is closely associated with the Narendra Modi government in India. This was the main reason for the opposition of Sri Lankan trade unions and opposition groups to its investments in Sri Lanka’s strategic industries. They see Adani’s presence in the country as geostrategic, not commercial.

Currently, Adani is involved in two main sectors – port development and energy – in Sri Lanka. Its involvement in both sectors is controversial.

Regarding Adani Group’s involvement in Sri Lankan port development, in early 2021 reports emerged of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd being offered a 49 percent stake at the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo port. This announcement came at a time when Sri Lanka, its economy in tatters due to the COVID-19 pandemic, appealed to “international investors to roll over bonds maturing this year.”

Given that then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced the deal a week after Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar visited Colombo, many speculated that the agreement with Adani came with the backing of the Indian government.

Colombo Port generates significant revenue and almost two-thirds of its transshipment business is linked with India. As The Hindu said, “New Delhi’s strategic interest in having a presence at the Port, located along one of the world’s shipping lanes, is no secret.” The Port at that time had four fully operational terminals – Jaya Container Terminal, Unity Container Terminal, South Asia Gateway Terminal, and Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT). The fifth, the ECT, was completed in 2015. However, its operations began only in late 2020.

The proposed agreement on the ECT was opposed by the trade unions, who pointed out that the Sri Lankan government had earlier planned to build the terminal through a public-private partnership (PPP) and the private sector partner was to be selected through an open and competitive process. But the agreement with the Adani Group was not done openly and competitively.

In mid-2020, India’s Observer Research Foundation (ORF) published a report showing that the Modi government indeed pushed Sri Lanka to sign a deal with the Indian company in exchange for aid. A few weeks later, Hindu Business Line published an article stating that the Adani Group would be the Indian government’s nominee for the project.

The Rajapaksa government scrapped the decision in the face of mounting pressure from the unions and political parties but decided to authorize the Adani Group to develop the WCT.

However, a Sunday Times report stated that the Adani Group is developing the Vizhinjam international deep-water multi-purpose seaport project in Kerala in India. The port lies only 176 nautical miles from Colombo port. Given the competing nature of the two projects, Sunday Times pointed out that “Adani Port coming into the ECT would not be beneficial for Sri Lanka since the Vizhinjam port is also being developed as a regional transshipment hub.”

Adani Group’s involvement in Sri Lanka’s power and energy sector has also been mired in controversy. The energy projects are the Group’s second major venture in Sri Lanka and followed the above-mentioned strategic port terminal deal.

In late February, Sri Lanka awarded two renewable energy projects, both wind power plants, worth $442 million. The plant in Mannar is to produce 250 megawatts of electricity while the other one, in Pooneryn, is to produce 100 megawatts. The agreement for the two projects was initially signed in March 2022.

Sri Lanka’s main opposition party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), alleged that the Indian company has a “backdoor entry” to Sri Lanka and that the Rajapaksa administration was pampering “notorious friends” of the Indian prime minister.

In June 2022, Chairman of the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board M.M.C. Ferdinando told Parliament’s Committee on Public Enterprises that the Sri Lankan government had been subject to pressure from Modi to award tenders to build renewable energy projects to the Adani Group. Upon the completion of the wind power plant, Sri Lanka will purchase a unit of electricity from Adani at U.S. 7.55 cents, paying twice the rate under competitive tendering. Ferdinando’s statement came soon after Sri Lanka amended its Electricity Act, removing the need for competitive bidding for energy projects, to allow the Adani Group to carry out renewable energy projects in the country.

The growth of the Adani Group from a medium-scale enterprise to an economic powerhouse within the span of two decades is closely tied to the owner’s relationship with Modi. Like Modi, Adani is from Gujrat and he stood by Modi at a time when Indian big business sentiment was decidedly anti-Modi, following the anti-Muslim pogrom in the state in 2002. For example, in 2003, leaders of Bajaj and Godrej, two of India’s oldest business groups, were critical of the law-and-order situation in Gujarat.

This formed a lasting connection between Modi and Adani and over the years. As a result, Adani’s company has grown with government projects and by mobilizing financial capital through his contacts with banks and markets.

Adani is a key player in ports, air mobility, and electricity generation – sectors that are priorities of the Modi government. Adani has also branched out into the media sphere and philanthropy. Given that the popularity of Modi doesn’t seem to be subsiding anytime soon, India’s neighbors will have to continue to deal with Adani’s footprint in the foreseeable future.","Get the NewsletterThe Sri Lankan foreign minister’s interview seems to confirm speculations about the special treatment that the Adani Group received in Sri Lanka in recent years, allegedly due to the pressure exerted by the Indian government on its Sri Lankan counterpart.

""Liberating.""

That's how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Indian tycoon Gautam Adani's acquisition of Haifa Port.

Appearing alongside the business magnate at the signing ceremony in late January, a smiling Netanyahu heaped praise over the $1.2bn deal and said he hoped it would usher in more ""connectivity between our countries"".

""I think this is an enormous milestone… Over 100 years ago, and during World World I, it was brave Indian soldiers who helped liberate the city of Haifa. And today, it's very robust Indian investors who are helping to liberate the port of Haifa,"" Netanyahu said.

The deal, one of the biggest foreign investments by India in any Israeli sector, saw Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) acquire a 70 percent stake of the now privatised Haifa Port, while Israel's Gadot Group purchased the remaining 30 percent.

Dominating headlines in both Israel and India, the deal was supposed to be a landmark moment for the coal magnate who was the world's third-richest person at the start of the year.

'Haifa Port has been a key site of Zionist and Israeli nation-building' - Sharri Plonski, Queen Mary University

But within days of crossing the t's and dotting the i's, Adani's flagship company, the Adani Group, was reeling under accusations of financial malpractice, fraudulent transactions, and share price manipulation.

The value of his companies fell dramatically despite a $400m investment from an Abu Dhabi investment fund. Within the span of a month, Adani, who has denied the charges, fell off the list of the world's top 10 richest people.

Given Adani's close proximity to power brokers in New Delhi, the Economist said it was ""a political embarrassment"" for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and one that ""confronts Indian capitalism with its sternest test in years"".

Netanyahu would call Modi on 9 February and the two friends would speak for some 20 minutes. Though the specifics of the conversation haven't been disclosed, both countries reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening ties and building on their strategic partnership.

That statement appeared to allay fears over Adani's involvement in Haifa Port and his ties with several Israeli companies and initiatives.

Later, Noar Gilon, Israel's ambassador in New Delhi, would tell local media: ""Adani is a very strong player in the world's port system. That is his core business. We believe that he will make this port stronger. He has paid all the money for the port.

""The port is his (Adani's). I believe the company has an interest in making this port successful, that is the hope of Israel and the interest of Israel, and that is in the interest of the Adani group as well. I believe that this port is going to be a flourishing port in the Mediterranean.""

In other words, the deal was done, Haifa was sold and both sides were going to make it work.

The story of Haifa Port

Sitting on the shores of the Mediterranean, Haifa Port has served as a major hub for seafarers from North Africa and Asia for hundreds of years.

Under the Ottoman Empire, it served as a key port at the northern tip of Palestine and was a catalyst for the city's population growth.

In 1918, Jews constituted less than 3,000 of the city's 22,000 residents. Under the British Mandate of Palestine, work began in 1929 to turn it into a fully-fledged deep-water port.

Authors Regev Nathansohn and Abbas Shiblak have noted that during this period, the late 1920s and 1930s, Haifa thrived and served as the administrative and economic centre of northern Palestine, even though 40 percent of the Palestinian population lived in slums.

""The city became a magnet, attracting Arab entrepreneurs and labor force from neighboring countries and beyond, and it increasingly offered diversity with respect to the 'other', and openness and tolerance towards the newcomers,"" Nathansohn and Shiblak wrote in Haifa Before & After 1948: Narratives of a Mixed City.

At the same time, the city also witnessed a divisive drive towards the establishment of a ""Jewish national home"".

""Haifa Port has been a key site of Zionist and Israeli nation-building ever since,"" Sharri Plonski, a senior lecturer at Queen Mary University, told Middle East Eye.

""It was also home base to the clandestine missions of the 'Palyam'. These pre-state naval militias were known for their sabotage of British ships and 'daring rescues' of Jewish refugees from British detention camps in the 1940s,"" Plonski added.

Haifa as 'Gateway to the East' by a British illustrator in the 1930s (Haifa Municipal Archive)

By 1947, the Jewish presence had increased and constituted around half of the city's 140,000 population. Under the UN Partition Plan, Haifa was designated as part of the new state of Israel and witnessed intense violence when Palestinians began being expelled in 1948.

Zionist militias displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians from the city and surrounding areas in an event the Palestinians call the Nakba, or Catastrophe.

On 30 June 1948, the British flag was removed from the port.

'This deal shows that Israelis trust India enough to privatise the state-owned Haifa Port and give it to Indian hands' - Hananya Naftali, Israeli influencer

""Haifa was historically a strategic port in the past. It was where the oil used to come in from Iraq. They (the British) lost that when the 1948 war happened,"" Toufic Haddad, a social scientist based in Jerusalem, told MEE.

""As far as a reliable port for western interests in the Eastern Mediterranean, Israel is the main bastion for that and Haifa is significant for that,"" he added.

Following the end of World War II, Haifa continued to be a key entry point for thousands of Jewish refugees and settlers from Europe.

In the 1950s, the port expanded under state control and would later become the largest and most important of Israel's three ports, the others being Ashdod and Eilat.

Haifa Port is so integral to Israel's GDP, that it's estimated to handle around 50 percent of all of Israel's cargo.

Along came Adani

Since the early 2000s, deliberations over privatising the port began under a series of economic reforms initiated by Netanyahu, who has repeatedly encouraged the sale of public assets to purportedly reduce corruption and lower costs.

In 2015, Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG), won a bid to operate the Haifa Bayport terminal for 25 years, much to the chagrin of the US government.

During his visit to Israel in May 2020, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Israel to cease infrastructure projects with the Chinese.

""We want the Chinese people to be successful, but we don't want the Chinese Communist Party to have access to Israeli infrastructure and to Israeli communication systems - all of the things that put Israeli citizens at risk - and in turn put the capacity for America to work alongside Israel on important projects at risk as well,"" Pompeo said.

A year later, however, the Chinese would begin operations at the terminal. When tenders opened for Haifa Port, Dubai's DP World, Turkey and China initially showed interest, but the US lobbied hard against Beijing acquiring the strategic port and DP World withdrew from the race in December 2021.

""Everyone at the port told me that they were excited for DP World to be involved. I am not sure why they withdrew,"" said Plonski, from the University of London.

Dan Catarivas, the Israeli coordinator of the India-Israel CEO Forum, admits that although there was excitement over the possibility of an Arab partner at Haifa, he concedes there were whispers the deal didn't go through because it may have been too much of a security risk to partner with an Arab country.

All of which created a perfect scenario for the Indians to get involved.

However, when Adani submitted his bid along with Gadot, it drowned out the competition.

It was 55 percent higher than the second-highest bid. This was not just a purchase, it was a statement of intent.

The Adani Group, a colossal corporation in India - involved in solar manufacturing to gas distribution, water treatment plants to airports, financial services to real estate - gave Israel the confidence that a major player with the backing of the Indian state would help realise the port’s potential.

Even then, the scale of the outsized bid surprised observers.

No Indian company has ever been as adventurous in its purchases abroad, Nicolas Blarel, an assistant professor of international relations at the Institute of Political Science at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told MEE.

""I think this was the biggest [India-Israel] deal I have seen. There have been big deals, but mostly in the defence sector. But in the private sector, this is completely new,"" Blarel said.

With India's ties with Israel booming since Modi took office in 2014, and India forming an integral part of the American bloc against China, the acquisition seemed to have pleased Washington.

For Israel, the acquisition was a boon. It would help re-establish the port as a key hub in the Middle East, and provide Israel with a unique opportunity to establish a trade route connecting the Mediterranean and the Gulf, bypassing the Suez Canal. Adani has promised to ""transform the entire port landscape"".

""The Haifa of tomorrow - will look very different from the Haifa that you see today. With your support - we will deliver on this commitment and do our part to transform this city,"" Adani said.

MEE reached out to the Adani Group on multiple occasions but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

DP World refused to respond to questions about its bid.

India-Israel relations

As a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement since the early 1950s, post-independence India was always perceived as a close friend of the Palestinian people.

Whereas Israel became a state in 1948, New Delhi would only recognise it in 1950. India also voted in 1975 at the UN for Resolution 3379 that designated Zionism as racism.

But once India normalised ties with Israel in 1992, the relationship swiftly changed direction.

Thirty years on, New Delhi is now the biggest buyer of Israeli weapons, inching ever closer to $2bn per year.

""It seems to me that India's past support for the Palestinians as part of its leadership role in the non-aligned and Third Worldist movements has already been abandoned for quite some time,"" Sai Englert, a lecturer in Area Studies at Leiden University, told MEE.

""Under Modi's leadership, this process has certainly accelerated, as he has actively sought to build relations with other repressive and conservative regimes across the globe.

""In that sense, his rapprochement with Israel is part of a wider trend,"" Englert added.

Over the past five years, in particular, Indian companies like Adani's have also started co-producing Israeli weapons. These include Tavor X95 assault rifles, Negev light machine guns, the Galil sniper rifles as well as Hermes 900 medium altitude long endurance drones.

The Hermes drones, first tested on Palestinians during the 2014 bombardment of Gaza, are produced for the Indian armed forces as well as for the export market.

And although ties between the two countries have continued to thrive, with India and Israel upgrading ties to a strategic partnership in 2017, it was under the auspices of the so-called Abraham Accords facilitated under former US President Donald Trump that ushered in a more significant role for New Delhi in the region.

India's ties with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt have also undergone several upgrades since the Abraham Accords.

The acquisition of the Haifa Port has also been aggressively sold as a massive win for India and Israel.

Israeli influencer Hananya Naftali described it as ""a breakthrough in our alliance [with India]"".

""I think this deal shows that Israelis trust India enough to privatise the state-owned Haifa Port and give it to Indian hands,"" Naftali said.

Several observers have also noted that the purchase signalled a huge shift in relations with Israel. Not only did it give India a chance to expand its footprint from Asia into the Middle East and Europe, but it also consolidated New Delhi’s quest to become a globally respected economic player.

In effect, Haifa Port placed Adani at the centre of trade between Asia and Europe. Observers noted the move may facilitate long-delayed free trade agreements between India and the European Union as well as Israel, too.

But it will also help expand Israel's economic interactions with South Asia and East Asia, and more importantly, further integrate the Israeli economy into the Middle East after years of being isolated from its neighbours.

""Their (Adani's) involvement in Israel, or in the Haifa Port, is not a one-off. It's part of a strategy, of the conglomerate, of bringing Israel and India into the Middle East region,"" Catarivas told MEE.

""I think they (Adani) see the port as being very important in the East-West connection and that eventually things will develop positively in the Middle East, and Haifa Port is a gateway for Europe from the Middle East and from Asia.

""In the medium long-term planning for Adani, this is a strategic acquisition that has geo-political thinking behind it,"" Catarivas added.

'Amplifying myths'

When Netanyahu handed Adani the proverbial key to Haifa Port on 31 January, it had already been the deadliest month for Palestinians since 2015.

At least 35 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in January alone.

This came off the back of the deadliest year for Palestinians since the end of the second Intifada in 2005. Around 220 Palestinians, including 48 children, were killed in 2022.

At the signing ceremony, Adani would focus on only one thing: lavishing praise on Israel.

An activist of India's Congress party carries an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indian tycoon Gautam Adani during a rally organised against the government's financial policies (AFP)

""Israel has always motivated me; you have rewritten the rules of what a population of less than 10 million can achieve. You have rewritten the rules by proving what a country with very little natural resources can achieve,"" he said.

""Israel"", Adani continued, was the ""outcome of its ability to beat all odds with the sheer power of science and technology.

""Your pace of innovation across multiple sectors amazes me. Your drive for innovations makes me wonder how we can learn from you.""

The remarks irked Israel and India critics who noted that both countries continue to amplify their foundational myths as democratic and ingenious countries, even though they pursue exclusionary and ethno-nationalist projects.

One year on, Haifa's uprising is inspiring a united Palestinian movement Read More »

Under Modi, India has seen a steep rise in attacks against Muslims, Christians and Dalits. The revocation of Kashmir's semi-autonomous status echoes Israel's project in the occupied West Bank, Englert said.

India's Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which institutionalised Muslims as outsiders, draws similarities to Israel's Right of Return Law.

""It is certainly true that Modi's own policies in Kashmir – focusing on population transfers, land grabs, and denying the rights of the Kashmiri people – have themselves been described as settler-colonial and have more than superficial similarities with Israel’s colonial policies directed against the Palestinian people,"" said Englert.

""In fact, there have been direct transfers of knowledge and technology from Israel to India to facilitate this process further.""

Within days of the announcement, an Indian flag was hoisted, alongside an Israel flag, at the port entrance.

""In a place like Israel, where it builds its stories and its nostalgia, as a way to prop up Israel as a kind of legitimate state, against Palestinian stories - which concerns the same place - it becomes important for it to amplify its myths,"" said Plonski.

""The most tangible impact of this brand erases the question of Palestine,"" Plonski said.

Internationalising the occupation

In October 2021, the West Asia Bloc, or I2U2 (Israel, India, US, UAE) grouping was officially formed.

In the days leading up to the summit, New Delhi said the group would encourage joint investments in areas such as water, energy, transportation, space, health, and food security.

Just as the so-called Abraham Accords had done, the I2U2 accelerated the process of development and modernisation, to expand securitisation and privatisation projects across the region, said Englert, from Leiden University.

The sale of Haifa Port didn't just illustrate Israel's centrality in a number of different geo-political manoeuvrings in the region, it represented the consolidation of an American-led alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative.

""The port is its [I2U2's] first important achievement,"" Englert said, adding that the acquisition also meant the further internationalisation of the Israeli occupation.

Less than a month after Netanyahu and Modi spoke on the phone following the Adani crisis, an American company, GQG Partners Inc, announced it would invest $1.88bn into four companies under the Adani banner. This included a 4.1 percent stake in Adani Ports for $640m.

The effect was immediate. Shares of the four Adani companies rose by five and 10 percent within a day. The Indian rupee, too, strengthened against the US dollar on account of the investment - the highest change in a month.

Hypernational space

With India investing heavily in Israel, other observers have warned that dangerous repercussions could follow.

The sale of the Haifa Port and the ""offshoring of Israel"", as Plonski describes it, are part of a scheme to unlink Israel from its colonial conquest in the name of creating so-called private, efficient and convenient spaces for global trade.

For an operation like this to run in the hyper-capitalist manner in which it is envisioned, it necessitates the further securitisation, containment, and brutalisation of Palestinians, Plonski said.

""The project of offshoring is about disconnecting these circuits of global trade [like the Haifa Port] from anything and everything - like local laws or politics - that could interrupt the quick movement of goods and services,"" Plonski said.

""Nothing moves through space magically. Ports are not empty spaces. They are full of national identities, profit-making, imperial identities and they are pregnant with all this all at once.

""They remain hypernational spaces, as the Indian flag at Haifa shows,"" Plonski said.","That's how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Indian tycoon Gautam Adani's acquisition of Haifa Port.
That statement appeared to allay fears over Adani's involvement in Haifa Port and his ties with several Israeli companies and initiatives.
The story of Haifa PortSitting on the shores of the Mediterranean, Haifa Port has served as a major hub for seafarers from North Africa and Asia for hundreds of years.
Haifa Port is so integral to Israel's GDP, that it's estimated to handle around 50 percent of all of Israel's cargo.

The proposal is under consideration, D V Chanaka, Sri Lanka’s State Minister for Power and Energy, told businessline on Friday.

It is also learnt that the Adani group would bring into the island country its own 5.2 MW turbines, a prototype of which has been working for a year at Mundra, Gujarat.

Power production

The Adani group has developed the machine with technology from W2E (Wind to Energy) GmbH of Germany. The blades describe a circle of 165 meters diameter and the nacelle can sit on towers as tall as 140 meters. It can work at wind speeds of 3 meters per minute (very low) to 20 mps, reaching its optimum power production at 12 mps wind speeds.

Sri Lanka has huge wind power potential, with wind speeds of 75 mps at its good sites. According to an estimate of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the USA made many years ago, Sri Lanka has offshore wind potential to put up 45 GW. If an estimate is made now, on the basis of more modern machines, the number would be much higher, say industry experts, who also pointed out that the country has immense offshore wind potential, too. Sri Lanka itself would need very little of it—perhaps 10 GW in 2030, the experts said.

Sri Lanka can make money by selling the surplus to India — just as Bhutan does with hydro power.

Chanaka said an agreement for building a power transmission line project, which could possibly run from Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka to Madurai.

The Adani Group furore broke in January, after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of stock manipulation; the report triggered a massive fall in Adani's fortune and his companies lost over $120 billion as a result. The crisis also triggered a row in Parliament.

The opposition called for a detailed probe into Hindenburg's allegations and a statement from the prime minister, whose government was accused of favouring the tycoon. The Supreme Court has ordered an expert panel on this issue.

Rao's remarks came a day after the daughter of chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, or KCR, was summoned to Delhi by the Enforcement Directorate for questioning in the alleged scam over the capital's liquor excise policy.

The ED has already arrested Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia - who quit as Delhi's deputy chief minister and excise minister after he was taken into custody - in this case and, this week, also arrested a Hyderabad-based businessman, Arun Pillai, who is reportedly an aide of K Kavitha.

Sisodia's arrest triggered massive protests by the opposition, which has repeatedly accused the BJP of using central agencies - like the ED - to harass and target rivals, particularly ahead of elections.

K Kavitha, a Member of the Legislative Council, is due to appear Saturday.

She was named in the liquor excise policy case as part of a 'South group' that allegedly paid ₹100 crore to the AAP. She issued a statement Wednesday on her summons, slamming 'power-mongers in Delhi' and said Telangana would never bow before an 'oppressive anti-people' regime.

If the decline following the publication of the Hindenburg report on January 23 was sharp—the group’s overall worth plummeted by more than $100 billion in just a matter of days— the recovery, partial as of now, has been equally swift.

Shares of all 10 listed firms of the group are currently trading higher than their respective 52-week lows touched in February. For instance, shares of Adani Enterprises, at Rs 2,039.65 on March 8, have more than doubled from their recent low. Experts attribute the recovery to several factors, including GQG Partners putting in over `15,000 crore and the Supreme Court bringing in clarity in terms of a time-bound probe into the allegations. “Post validation of the investor putting in over Rs 15,000 crore, the touch-me-not attitude has been removed,” says Arun Kejrwial of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services.

Analysts say the market has taken solace from the fact that the money that has come to the promoter entities from the GQG transaction has been immediately deployed to reduce the group’s loan burden and release pledged shares. Earlier this month, the group said it had repaid share-based financing of Rs 7,374 crore and prepaid the debts of $500 million (nearly Rs 4,100 crore) it had taken to finance the acquisition of Ambuja Cements. More importantly, it said that it would be prepaying all such remaining loans by end-March. Unsurprisingly, shares of some of the Adani Group firms have been hitting upper circuits regularly.

This was the third day in a row — since the second half of the Budget session began — that the party had gone all guns blazing against the alleged ‘Adani-Modi relationship’.

The MPs from the Congress and at least 16 other parties weren’t allowed beyond Parliament area by the Delhi police.

In the previous session, the Congress’ attack against industrialist Gautam Adani was based on the findings of the US-based research firm Hindenburg. In this session, however, it was the Congress’ response to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s demand for an apology from its leader Rahul Gandhi for his “democracy-in-danger” comment made in the UK.

The Congress’ sustained focus on Adani has many asking if this is a redux of the ‘Chowkidar Chor Hai’ (the guard is the thief) and Rafale scam tropes that proved electorally disastrous for the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

However, Gandhi and the party leadership believe that the Adani issue is different. Multiple Congress leaders, including parliamentarians, ThePrint spoke to said there are three reasons for this belief.

First, the party thinks that unlike Rafale, which was just one scam or deal, the Adani issue can be the beginning of many more such charges that can take away the “incorruptible” halo around Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Second, the party believes its campaign will split the corporate world and draw a section of them towards the Congress once they are convinced that the Adani group is being unfairly favoured by the government, leaving others to fend for themselves.

Third, the party is also using the Adani issue to target small traders who they have been trying to woo by insinuating that the BJP is destroying small businesses. And if small businesses are suffering and the business of one man is becoming better, it is bound to have an electoral impact.

Talking to ThePrint, Congress’s general secretary in-charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh, said the messaging is largely working.

“I believe most people are convinced that Adani would not have been able to do what he did without the PM’s involvement. Will it yield electoral gain? That depends on our party organisation,” he said.

Will the Congress strategy work?

The first question, though, is whether Adani can ‘stick’ as a corruption issue given that allegations of stock price manipulation etc. are difficult for the common man to understand. It has a much more difficult syntax than, for example, the Commonwealth Game (CWG) scam that proved to be instrumental in bringing down the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2014. The Congress leaders believe it will.

“With Adani, there is the data and the easy numbers to show that his ranking in the world’s richest has gone up from 609 to 2nd in the world in a short span of time,” said a source working on the party’s strategy in the run up to 2024 elections.

The source added: “You can argue that Rafale was difficult to understand and that CWG (scam) was easy to understand. But the BJP’s poll plank at the time wasn’t just CWG. It was 2G also. It was a bunch of incidents which tied the Congress to corruption. Rafale was one deal and we went with it. Here, the Adani scam may not be one entire poll issue, but it can make way for other such issues to come out — other skeletons to come out of the closet — which will then show that this really is a ‘suit boot ki sarkar’.

The second question many are asking is if the Congress will be able to sustain this narrative against the PM and Adani.

To this, the source mentioned above said the scam itself can’t be a poll plank for 2024, but the party will “milk” it till it can.

“It’s very difficult to talk about one specific scam or individual for a year. From my understanding, there will be cycles (aspects) of this issue that will come to the fore from time to time and each time we’ll have to capitalise on it,” the source said.

Jairam Ramesh, on the other hand, told ThePrint that electoral gains for the Congress, where Adani is concerned, will depend on how the party organises itself around this issue.

“We have to do what we have to do. We are certainly doing our best to unravel the full dimensions of this SuperScam that has taken place with the full knowledge and active association of the PM. We have raised three pointed questions daily for 28 days. We have written to SEBI and RBI. We have held press meets across the country. Whether this will yield electoral gains will depend on the party organisation,” he said.

Crony capitalism & division

ThePrint spoke to various members of the party organisation and MPs who are agitating in Parliament to better understand where the Congress wants to go with the Adani issue.

A Congress MP, who was at a meet of the Congress’ Parliamentary Party (CPP) Monday, chaired by Sonia Gandhi, said that while the party was apprehensive about the privileges committee suspending Rahul Gandhi on the first day of the new session, the plan was to disrupt the House on the Adani issue.

“The opposition is not united on the Adani issue. Some are demanding a JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee). Some are demanding a Supreme Court-monitored probe. Most regional parties, including some of our allies, have made peace with the Adani group and will not push beyond a point. If the Rahul issue was not brought up, then the Adani issue might have fizzled out in this session,” said the MP.

“But because they brought up the demand for an apology (by Rahul), we moved ahead full steam with Adani. The idea that we are being constantly communicated is that Adani’s links with Modi are clear so we should push to ensure that the linkage between the two stays in public memory. Of course, ‘crony capitalism’ is the overarching issue,” the MP stated.

The source from Gandhi’s team says that while the push is against crony capitalism, the party’s understanding is that it has also created “corporate warfare”. This means that those corporate entities not ‘favoured’ by the government will naturally be antagonistic about Adani’s rise. The party plans to get these corporate entities on its side in a bid to isolate Adani in the corporate ecosystem, the source revealed.

“Those corporates which are opposed to Adani are reaching out to us. More of them will help us so that Adani stops receiving preferential treatment,” said the source, declining to reveal the names of these corporates.

It is also interesting to note that while the Congress and Rahul Gandhi’s’ fight against alleged crony capitalism started with Adani-Ambani jibes, it has totally been focused on Adani ever since the Hindenburg report was released.

Connecting Adani to LIC, targeting small traders

One of the first attempts by the party to connect the Adani issue to the grassroots was by pointing out investments made by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and State Bank of India (SBI) in these groups.

“On the face of it, this is not an issue that people in rural areas will understand. So, the fact that their money has been invested in the Adani group was important to point out,” said a Congress MP, who was part of protests in Parliament campus today.

When his attention was drawn to ThePrint’s report that LIC would, in fact, make a profit of close to Rs 11,000 crore if it were to sell its shares in Adani, the MP said, “It’s not about how much profit or loss LIC will make. But in principle, public money should not be invested in crony capitalists. That’s the point we are trying to make.”

The source from Rahul Gandhi’s team, quoted above in the copy, also pointed out that the party was trying to win back “small traders” and MSMEs through its campaigns against GST and demonetisation.

“There is a section of small traders who invest in stocks and are aware of how the market works. They will understand this and some of them are also BJP/Modi voters. Since their businesses are suffering (due to GST, among other things), they will also understand that another businessman is making money due to his collusion with the government,” said another party source.

Govt on Adani-Hindenburg row

The government said that Hindenburg Research's report didn't have any “significant impact at the systemic level"" although their market capitalisation within two months had dipped to 60 per cent.

The Union Finance Ministry also informed Lok Sabha that the government had not constituted any committee to investigate the allegations made against the Adani Group of companies.

While responding to questions asked by Congress members of Parliament (MPs), T N Prathapan, Manish Tewari and Jothimani Sennimalai, who had sought an update on the investigation into the alleged stock manipulation by the Adani group of companies, Union minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said that capital market regulator SEBI had already taken up the investigation and would conclude it within two months as per a Supreme Court order dated 2 March.

After taking a beating on the bourses, following the bombshell report, Adani Group stocks have recovered significantly.

The report had made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against it. However, Adani has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

If the decline following the publication of the Hindenburg report on January 23 was sharp—the group’s overall worth plummeted by more than $100 billion in just a matter of days— the recovery, partial as of now, has been equally swift.

Shares of all 10 listed firms of the group are currently trading higher than their respective 52-week lows touched in February. For instance, shares of Adani Enterprises, at Rs 2,039.65 on March 8, have more than doubled from their recent low. Experts attribute the recovery to several factors, including GQG Partners putting in over `15,000 crore and the Supreme Court bringing in clarity in terms of a time-bound probe into the allegations. “Post validation of the investor putting in over Rs 15,000 crore, the touch-me-not attitude has been removed,” says Arun Kejrwial of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services.

Analysts say the market has taken solace from the fact that the money that has come to the promoter entities from the GQG transaction has been immediately deployed to reduce the group’s loan burden and release pledged shares. Earlier this month, the group said it had repaid share-based financing of Rs 7,374 crore and prepaid the debts of $500 million (nearly Rs 4,100 crore) it had taken to finance the acquisition of Ambuja Cements. More importantly, it said that it would be prepaying all such remaining loans by end-March. Unsurprisingly, shares of some of the Adani Group firms have been hitting upper circuits regularly.

This was the third day in a row — since the second half of the Budget session began — that the party had gone all guns blazing against the alleged ‘Adani-Modi relationship’.

The MPs from the Congress and at least 16 other parties weren’t allowed beyond Parliament area by the Delhi police.

In the previous session, the Congress’ attack against industrialist Gautam Adani was based on the findings of the US-based research firm Hindenburg. In this session, however, it was the Congress’ response to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s demand for an apology from its leader Rahul Gandhi for his “democracy-in-danger” comment made in the UK.

The Congress’ sustained focus on Adani has many asking if this is a redux of the ‘Chowkidar Chor Hai’ (the guard is the thief) and Rafale scam tropes that proved electorally disastrous for the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

However, Gandhi and the party leadership believe that the Adani issue is different. Multiple Congress leaders, including parliamentarians, ThePrint spoke to said there are three reasons for this belief.

First, the party thinks that unlike Rafale, which was just one scam or deal, the Adani issue can be the beginning of many more such charges that can take away the “incorruptible” halo around Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Second, the party believes its campaign will split the corporate world and draw a section of them towards the Congress once they are convinced that the Adani group is being unfairly favoured by the government, leaving others to fend for themselves.

Third, the party is also using the Adani issue to target small traders who they have been trying to woo by insinuating that the BJP is destroying small businesses. And if small businesses are suffering and the business of one man is becoming better, it is bound to have an electoral impact.

Talking to ThePrint, Congress’s general secretary in-charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh, said the messaging is largely working.

“I believe most people are convinced that Adani would not have been able to do what he did without the PM’s involvement. Will it yield electoral gain? That depends on our party organisation,” he said.

Will the Congress strategy work?

The first question, though, is whether Adani can ‘stick’ as a corruption issue given that allegations of stock price manipulation etc. are difficult for the common man to understand. It has a much more difficult syntax than, for example, the Commonwealth Game (CWG) scam that proved to be instrumental in bringing down the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2014. The Congress leaders believe it will.

“With Adani, there is the data and the easy numbers to show that his ranking in the world’s richest has gone up from 609 to 2nd in the world in a short span of time,” said a source working on the party’s strategy in the run up to 2024 elections.

The source added: “You can argue that Rafale was difficult to understand and that CWG (scam) was easy to understand. But the BJP’s poll plank at the time wasn’t just CWG. It was 2G also. It was a bunch of incidents which tied the Congress to corruption. Rafale was one deal and we went with it. Here, the Adani scam may not be one entire poll issue, but it can make way for other such issues to come out — other skeletons to come out of the closet — which will then show that this really is a ‘suit boot ki sarkar’.

The second question many are asking is if the Congress will be able to sustain this narrative against the PM and Adani.

To this, the source mentioned above said the scam itself can’t be a poll plank for 2024, but the party will “milk” it till it can.

“It’s very difficult to talk about one specific scam or individual for a year. From my understanding, there will be cycles (aspects) of this issue that will come to the fore from time to time and each time we’ll have to capitalise on it,” the source said.

Jairam Ramesh, on the other hand, told ThePrint that electoral gains for the Congress, where Adani is concerned, will depend on how the party organises itself around this issue.

“We have to do what we have to do. We are certainly doing our best to unravel the full dimensions of this SuperScam that has taken place with the full knowledge and active association of the PM. We have raised three pointed questions daily for 28 days. We have written to SEBI and RBI. We have held press meets across the country. Whether this will yield electoral gains will depend on the party organisation,” he said.

Crony capitalism & division

ThePrint spoke to various members of the party organisation and MPs who are agitating in Parliament to better understand where the Congress wants to go with the Adani issue.

A Congress MP, who was at a meet of the Congress’ Parliamentary Party (CPP) Monday, chaired by Sonia Gandhi, said that while the party was apprehensive about the privileges committee suspending Rahul Gandhi on the first day of the new session, the plan was to disrupt the House on the Adani issue.

“The opposition is not united on the Adani issue. Some are demanding a JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee). Some are demanding a Supreme Court-monitored probe. Most regional parties, including some of our allies, have made peace with the Adani group and will not push beyond a point. If the Rahul issue was not brought up, then the Adani issue might have fizzled out in this session,” said the MP.

“But because they brought up the demand for an apology (by Rahul), we moved ahead full steam with Adani. The idea that we are being constantly communicated is that Adani’s links with Modi are clear so we should push to ensure that the linkage between the two stays in public memory. Of course, ‘crony capitalism’ is the overarching issue,” the MP stated.

The source from Gandhi’s team says that while the push is against crony capitalism, the party’s understanding is that it has also created “corporate warfare”. This means that those corporate entities not ‘favoured’ by the government will naturally be antagonistic about Adani’s rise. The party plans to get these corporate entities on its side in a bid to isolate Adani in the corporate ecosystem, the source revealed.

“Those corporates which are opposed to Adani are reaching out to us. More of them will help us so that Adani stops receiving preferential treatment,” said the source, declining to reveal the names of these corporates.

It is also interesting to note that while the Congress and Rahul Gandhi’s’ fight against alleged crony capitalism started with Adani-Ambani jibes, it has totally been focused on Adani ever since the Hindenburg report was released.

Connecting Adani to LIC, targeting small traders

One of the first attempts by the party to connect the Adani issue to the grassroots was by pointing out investments made by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and State Bank of India (SBI) in these groups.

“On the face of it, this is not an issue that people in rural areas will understand. So, the fact that their money has been invested in the Adani group was important to point out,” said a Congress MP, who was part of protests in Parliament campus today.

When his attention was drawn to ThePrint’s report that LIC would, in fact, make a profit of close to Rs 11,000 crore if it were to sell its shares in Adani, the MP said, “It’s not about how much profit or loss LIC will make. But in principle, public money should not be invested in crony capitalists. That’s the point we are trying to make.”

The source from Rahul Gandhi’s team, quoted above in the copy, also pointed out that the party was trying to win back “small traders” and MSMEs through its campaigns against GST and demonetisation.

“There is a section of small traders who invest in stocks and are aware of how the market works. They will understand this and some of them are also BJP/Modi voters. Since their businesses are suffering (due to GST, among other things), they will also understand that another businessman is making money due to his collusion with the government,” said another party source.

Govt on Adani-Hindenburg row

The government said that Hindenburg Research's report didn't have any “significant impact at the systemic level"" although their market capitalisation within two months had dipped to 60 per cent.

The Union Finance Ministry also informed Lok Sabha that the government had not constituted any committee to investigate the allegations made against the Adani Group of companies.

While responding to questions asked by Congress members of Parliament (MPs), T N Prathapan, Manish Tewari and Jothimani Sennimalai, who had sought an update on the investigation into the alleged stock manipulation by the Adani group of companies, Union minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said that capital market regulator SEBI had already taken up the investigation and would conclude it within two months as per a Supreme Court order dated 2 March.

After taking a beating on the bourses, following the bombshell report, Adani Group stocks have recovered significantly.

The report had made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against it. However, Adani has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

The Adani Group is already under heavy scrutiny for fraud claims made by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research. In its scathing report published on January 24, the short-seller claimed that the Indian conglomerate was engaged in a ""brazen stock manipulation"" and ""accounting fraud"".

The Hindenburg report, which caused mayhem in Adani group stocks, claimed that Vinod Adani managed a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities for Gautam Adani. The short-seller also said that it identified 38 Mauritius-based shell entities controlled by Vinod Adani or his close associates. Adani Group, however, rubbished the claim saying Vinod Adani did not have any role in group companies' day-to-day affairs.

Today, the report said that rather than using a direct overseas subsidiary, the Adani Group used a network of offshore entities to acquire Ambuja Cements and ACC. ""It has now emerged, according to the final offer letter issued by Ambuja Cements, that the ultimate beneficial owner of Endeavour is 'Mr Vinod Shantilal Adani and Mrs Ranjanben Vnod Adani' through entities based in Mauritius, Dubai, and the British Virgin Islands,"" the report said.

The report was immediately picked up by TMC MP Mahua Moitra, who has been targeting the embattled group and the central government for no action against Adani by market regulator Sebi. She, in a tweet, said: ""'The Adani group does not own Ambuja Cements and ACC' - Deception of the highest order. One cannot make this stuff up. @SEBI_India and @CCI_India would have been provided all details!""

In another tweet, the TMC leader said Ambuja Cements reportedly had Rs 9,829 crore cash and cash equivalents on its books at the end of December 2022. ""Am very keen to see cash position & related party (or rather suspicious) transactions of Ambuja Cements at end of this month! Kitna gayab aur kisko gaya!"" she said.

Sharing the details of the deal with Holcim, Adani Group in its statement said that the transaction was financed by facilities aggregating to $4.50 billion availed from 14 international banks. Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, and Standard Chartered Bank acted as original mandated lead arrangers and book-runners to the transaction.

On January 29, Adani Group came out with a detailed report and responded to charges against Vinod Adani.

Adani Group does not own the two cement companies that it bought last year, the Morning Context said in a report on Monday.

In September last year, Adani Group informed that it had acquired Ambuja and ACC from Swiss cement major Holcim for $10.5 billion, becoming the country's second-largest cement manufacturer after Aditya Birla Group's UltraTech Cement. For the transaction, the Adani Group created a special-purpose vehicle called Endeavour Trade and Investment Ltd. The group mentioned this in its statement issued after the deal.

The government also said that it had submitted to the Supreme Court that it was “already enquiring into the allegations made in the Hindenburg report as well as the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report”.

SEBI to submit a report into allegations against Adani group in two months

In response to a question from Congress MP Manish Tewari, who had also asked about the details of the agenda of the SEBI investigation and the proposed timeline of its completion, the minister of state for finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, stated that the Supreme Court has directed SEBI to conclude the ongoing investigations within two months.

To a query from the MP on “the scope/remit of the Committee to investigate the Adani Group as suggested by the Government to the Supreme Court and the reasons for giving such suggestions/names in a sealed cover”, the Minister said “the Government of India submitted its suggestions on the remit of the Committee proposed to be constituted” by the apex court.

He added that the suggested terms of reference were shared with the petitioners on the directions of the court. These directed the panel “to ascertain and submit a report regarding the truthfulness or otherwise of the allegations made against Adani group of companies in the Hindenburg Report; to ascertain and submit a report regarding Hindenburg’s admitted claim of taking a ‘short position in Adani group Companies through US traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivatives instruments’ prior to the publication of its subject report with all underlying transactions undertaken/ made either by Hindenburg itself, its associated companies/ concerns and/ or connected entities/ individuals, whether within or outside India in violation of any regulatory/ penal/ preventive or other statutory provisions”.

Furthermore, the reply stated that the panel would “ascertain and submit a report regarding the details of all undisclosed ‘short position’ and/ or other transactions, source of funds and profits made by short sellers in India or abroad prior to and/or in near proximity of the Hindenburg report” and “suggest measures to strengthen investor awareness including at the point of trade”.

DRI probe into import of Indonesian coal by Adani group has ‘not reached finality’

Several other MPs also raised questions on the Adani issue in the Lok Sabha.

Another Congress MP S. Jothimani asked about the key findings and outcomes of the probe by SEBI and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) into the Adani group companies. In reply to her question, the MoS finance submitted that “investigations pertaining to imports of Power Generation, Power Transmission and Infrastructure (Port & SEZ) equipment by Adani Group companies have been concluded by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and report has been submitted before the relevant judicial authorities”.

As regards the case pertaining to imports of Indonesian coal by the Adani Group of companies, the minister said, “investigations by DRI have not reached finality as information sought from exporting countries through execution of Letters Rogatory (LRs) is under litigation.”

‘Nine Adani companies witnessed 60% erosion of market cap after report’

Congress MP from Thrissur T.N. Prathapan asked about the “investigation into the stock market manipulation by Adani Group of Companies”. To a query from him on “whether the Government is aware of the fall in the fortune of the head of Adani group of companies and if so, the details thereof and the reaction of the Government thereto; and whether the Government is aware of the reasons behind the said fall in the fortune of Adani group of companies”, the MoS Finance stated that

“the nine listed companies forming part of Adani Group witnessed a decline of around 60% of market capitalization from January 24, 2023, till March 01, 2023 subsequent to the report published by Hindenburg Research.”

The Minister added that “these companies are not part of Sensex and have a combined weight of below 1% in Nifty.” He added that “the volatility in the stocks of these companies have not had any significant impact at the systemic level. Nifty 50 declined by around 2.9% in the month of January 2023 and by around 4.9% in the 2-month period of January and February 2023.”

‘Centre has not constituted any committee to probe allegations against the Adani group’

To another question from Communist Party of India MP K. Subbarayan on “whether the Government has constituted any Committee to investigate the allegations made against the Adani Group of companies by short-seller Hindenburg Research of the US”, the minister replied in the negative.

Yet another question was posed on the issue by Revolutionary Socialist Party MP N.K. Premachandran who asked if the Government has analysed the impact of the Hindenburg report in the corporate sector of the country and if it proposed to “restrict disbursement of further loans to the likes of Adani Group of companies from nationalized banks and financial institutions of the Government in the light of the said report”.

To this, Chaudhary answered that “as per Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks are free to take credit-related decisions based on internal assessment of the commercial viability of the loan within their Board approved policies and within RBI’s prudential guidelines. Further, RBI has informed that under the provisions of section 45E of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, RBI is prohibited from disclosing credit information.”

LIC debt exposure to Adani group was Rs 6,182 crore on March 5

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in response to a written question from Congress MP Deepak Baij, who had asked about the details of loan/credit exposure of various public sector banks and insurance companies to Adani group of companies that “the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has informed that its debt exposure to Adani Group of Companies, as per annexed details, was Rs 6,347.32 crore and ₹6,182.64 crore, as on 31.12.2022 and 5.3.2023, respectively.”

She added that “the five Public Sector General Insurance companies have informed that these companies do not have loan/credit exposure to Adani Group of Companies.”

On the question of risk of exposure to these companies, she stated that “as per inputs received from RBI, in order to protect banks from risk, it has implemented large exposure framework which limits the exposures that a bank can take to a single counterparty and a group of connected counterparties to 20 per cent (extendable to 25 per cent by the Board of the bank under exceptional circumstances) and 25 per cent, respectively, of the eligible capital base of the bank.”","New Delhi: The Union government has said that there is no probe committee from its end to investigate allegations against the Adani Group but the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has undertaken an “investigation into the market allegations” against the conglomerate.
The government also said that it had submitted to the Supreme Court that it was “already enquiring into the allegations made in the Hindenburg report as well as the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report”.

The reasons are more internal. The reasons are that there is a slowdown in the economy based on the GDP numbers that we have seen,” says market veteranYes, you can call it the midpoint. It is a very boring sideways market. It might look exciting because it has been down from the peaks a bit, but it has been a very slow grinding fall most of the time. So yes, it has been quiet. And quiet is good. There is no reason to come to the market for excitement.2008 was the first time we saw a banking crisis of that order in living memory. There can be routine failures; in India too, in 2000 Global Trust Bank failed. In ‘90s also, a couple of banks failed. Those are individual events. In the US, there have been a lot of bank failures. There are community banks. The US is a huge country like India and there are small banks serving the local community. They keep going burst if you look at the data.But 2008 was a completely different animal in which there was a large-scale collapse of the financial system itself, not just lending banks but investment banks and brokers and everything. Everything from Merrill Lynch to Lehman to Washington Mutual to AIG, which is an insurance company. It was a completely different order of magnitude. Compared to that, we would take SVB or the Signature Bank collapse any day.The other thing is regulators learn to act very quickly. There is always learning with a new event. So, 2008 will not get repeated by any stretch. I mean, let us not even start thinking like that.I completely agree with that. I do not think SVB is the problem. If indeed you want to look for problems, the problems may well be more internal to India than an external shock like a large-scale banking contagion in the US. That will have its occasional day in the sun, but that is not the reason why India has underperformed this year. It is a completely different set of reasons altogether.I think Adani was a non-issue for any serious investor in the stock markets. We made it an issue beyond what it deserved to be. It is a large group, but still one group and one group cannot be said to be representative of the entire market, no matter which group that is. We have had governance problems with Infosys . We have had governance problems with Reliance, not one, but maybe a dozen of them. Sebi has passed orders against Reliance promoters, against Mukesh Ambani or against Reliance company or group companies. Sun Pharma , a marquee company, has had a series of problems in the last three-four years’ time. None of that has been represented in the public eye as if that is going to dent the image of India or is an attack on India. It is all complete and total nonsense. This is a group problem. The group is dealing with it and more power to them. They are important for the growth of certain parts of India, which is the infrastructure part and I hope and I pray that they come out of it. But to extend that to say the market is going to suffer because of that is a complete non sequitur in my view.We draw false positives and false correlations and causalities. The Adani Group or SVB was not the reason why the Indian markets have been somnolent in the last two or three months’ time. The reasons are more internal. The reasons are that there is a slowdown in the economy based on the GDP numbers that we have seen. The markets have been sensing that and I speak to companies all the time and right after Diwali, from Diwali onward last year, I started to get a sense that there was a slowdown in spending.Rural economy has been hurting in any case. It was urban spending which was propping it up and that has also started to slow down. That is where the market started to get a bit jittery. It is not Adani, it is not a foreign bank contagion.You are absolutely spot on. The competition for the market is the fixed income part, it is a much detested cousin because all of us are equity guys. We do not like fixed income in most part, but it is providing in India and globally some amazing returns. In the US, like I tweeted, you can buy good quality bond ETFs for now for about 5%, 5.5%, 6% yields, even 7% yields. Real estate investment interests are like 9%, 10%, 11%, 12% yields.In Singapore also, you can get fairly decent yields. In India, the yields are really mouth-watering to say the least which provide you low volatility returns for an average investor. Again, that is a good reason to attribute the equity markets’ underperformance in India. Adani or the foreign bank thing are very temporary phenomena, it is more fundamental and which is that rates are very attractive and people are at this point choosing fixed income over equities.Again, I go back to my point that the economy being what it is, my belief is you are not going to get a broad bull market. I do not think any of us should hold out hope that we are going to see a broad bull market in India anytime soon. We are going to see very patchy markets in which a reasonable part of the markets will be flat or even down, while small pockets of stocks whether in the Nifty or below the Nifty will be doing well and that is really the skill of your investment acumen will be tested this year.","“The Adani Group or SVB was not the reason why the Indian markets have been somnolent in the last two or three months..

The Adani Airport Holdings Limited (AAHL) airports served 14.25 million passengers in 2022, rising by around 100% year-on-year to reach pre-pandemic 2019 levels.

Domestic passenger numbers across all airports rose by +92% year-on-year while international traffic surged +133%. Domestic flight numbers were up by +58% and international flights increased +61%.

The surge in traffic followed the post-crisis reopening of routes and airports. “This upward trend is expected to continue, and it is anticipated that the number of trips people will take in a year will increase,” Adani, India’s largest airport infrastructure company, commented. “One of the factors driving this growth is the restart of tourism after the pandemic.”

Adani said the healthy traffic figures were also driven by positive sentiments among air travellers and a strong surge due to the festive holiday season.

It said such results reaffirmed the company’s attempts to promote passenger confidence through initiatives such as e-gates; barcode scanners; friendly and cooperative ground staff; Pranam Service (meet and greet); free wifi; automated parking systems; and enhanced retail and F&B offers.

Collectively such initiatives have improved the customer experience and safety standards across all airports, the group noted.

Strong start to 2023

Early 2023 passenger volumes are encouraging. Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) was the country’s second-busiest airport (behind Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi) for the first two months, recording nearly 8.44 million passenger movements. That comprised 2.22 million international and 6.22 million domestic passengers.

During the same period, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad served 1.74 million domestic passengers (arriving and departing) and 283,379 international travellers. Jaipur International Airport, India’s 11th-busiest gateway last year, attracted nearly 880,000 domestic passengers and 69,300 international.

Lucknow’s Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport (CCSIA), the busiest airport in Uttar Pradesh, served 1.04 million passenger movements across the two months, mostly domestic. Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International, the gateway to Northeast India, attracted 902,694 passengers, up sharply year-on-year.

Thiruvananthapuram recorded 299,850 and 299,770 domestic and international passengers (departing and arriving), respectively. The airport has connectivity to ten domestic and 12 international destinations. Mangaluru saw increased traffic of 209,713 national and 84,356 foreign travellers.

Record daily traffic

Both CSMIA and CCSIA generated record passenger movements on a single day. The Mumbai gateway served around 1,51,543 travellers on 25 February while Lucknow drew more than 18,000 passengers on 31 January.

By 2040, India is expected to welcome 1 billion travellers, while 31 cities will have dual airport systems. The compound annual growth rate for the next 20 years is estimated to be around 8.5%, with fleet projections of over 2,500 aircraft. ✈

Skyhigh growth India’s per capita air passenger traffic (i.e. total air passengers/ total population) stands at 0.12. That compares with 2.7 (22x) for the United States and 0.31 (2.5x) for China, indicating massive potential for Indian aviation, Adani noted. India is expected to have 1 billion passengers by 2040 with an expected 8.5% CAGR for the next 20 years. As many as 31 cities are expected to have dual airport systems while Delhi-NCR, Mumbai metropolitan region and Bangalore will potentially have three. The number of operational airports is expected to exceed 200 with total capex requirement exceeding US$100 billion (including landside developments). The number of Adani airports serving over 10 million passengers in a year will increase from 7 to 47, the company said. This is supported by fleet projections of over 2,500 aircraft by 2040 (today, India has ~600 operational aircraft). With an increasing penetration of wide bodies within airline fleets, passenger traffic is expected to increase multifold as it will gear the Indian aviation market closer to a hub-based network, compared to the point-to-point structure today, Adani said.

Would Indian banks and insurance companies with significant exposure to the ports-to-power conglomerate also teeter? Would the contagion spread to the rest of the Indian financial world? And would India’s government pursue an aggressive investigation into the short-seller’s allegations of fraud and stockmarket manipulation, which set off the imbroglio (and which the Adani Group vehemently denies)?

A month and a half on, the answers to the first two questions are, happily for India, “no”. The answer to the third is less categorical, and somewhat less constructive: the government seems in no rush to settle the matter, perhaps because the Adani firms’ modest free float means a small number of mostly big shareholders bore much of the pain and no angry mob of retail investors is pressing Delhi to get to the bottom of it, fast. With those big questions out of the way, attention has turned to the next conundrum: can the Adani Ggroup and its eponymous tycoon founder, Gautam Adani, recover? Or will they founder, possibly dragging the Indian government’s grand plans for investments in infrastructure and green energy down with them?

The past month has offered hope to those rooting for Mr Adani and his businesses, which operate some of India’s biggest ports and airports, store a third of its grain, run a fifth of its power-transmission lines, produce a lot of its cement—and have their eye on clean hydrogen and steelmaking, among other ventures. The group’s total market value has climbed back to more than $110bn, from a low of $82bn. That of its flagship public company, Adani Enterprises, is up by 54% from its nadir on February 27th. The yields on bonds issued by some Adani firms have come down from levels indicating distress.

Story continues

The big turn in the Adani Group’s fortunes came in early March, after GQG Partners, a fund that is based in America, listed in Australia and run by an Indian, bought $1.9bn in shares of several of the group’s companies directly from the Adani family. At the time, GQG’s boss, Rajiv Jain, who lives in Florida, told the Financial Times that “the market was mispricing Adani” and praised the conglomerate’s “very competent management” and “fantastic” execution capabilities.

Mr Adani used the proceeds to help repay $2.1bn in margin loans that used Adani companies’ shares as collateral, relieving one possible source of financial stress. Another $1.1bn, half coming from the Adani family and half from the Adani businesses’ cashflows, was used to meet other near-term obligations. These moves reduced the group’s outstanding debt by just 4%, to $27bn. But they eased pressure and reassured the market. So did the acquisitive conglomerate’s decision to pause new capital investments, beyond those it had already pledged, until September 2024, and to put big takeovers on hold.

As these demonstrations of financial discipline were taking place, the Adani Group embarked on a global charm offensive, set to conclude on March 17th in California. It appears to be working. Mr Jain, for one, has said GQG’s stakes in Adani businesses “most likely will increase depending on the price and how they deliver”. The group says it has been receiving plenty of interest from investors looking to park their money in its assorted companies. It says that a recent news report of a sale of just under 5% in its cement operations is bogus. But it does not dismiss the possibility of selling stakes in some of its divisions. Several of these, like the ports business, are solid operations offering predictable returns—maybe even good ones, if India’s economy continues to grow at its recent pace of 7-9% a year.

With the Adani Group on more stable footing, another question is bound to arise: how long can Mr Adani hold his nation-building ambitions in check? On March 1st his conglomerate was awarded a bauxite mine in a government auction. For the time being, the asset, for which the company had always been planning to bid, will be folded into Adani Enterprises’ mining subsidiary. But before the short-seller’s assault, the bid for the mine was widely regarded as part of a larger plan to enter aluminium smelting, steelmaking and other bits of heavy industry. Mr Adani is unlikely to have forsaken that idea for ever.

India NewsNDTV...",None,"""Don't Want JPC To Probe Adani Issue Because..."": Trinamool Explains","Derek O'Brien said the funds in LIC and SBI are ""at risk"".

Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien reiterated his party's demand as the logjam in parliament continued for the fourth straight day today over opposition demands and the government's insistence on an apology from Congress's Rahul Gandhi. The Trinamool, Mr O'Brien told the media, has been drawing attention to three issues since the last session of parliament -- one of which is the Adani-Hindenburg row.

He questioned why central probe agencies were not inquiring into the allegations of US shortseller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group. ""What is stopping the CBI and ED, who work overtime when it comes to opposition leaders?"" he said at a press conference.

The Trinamool, Mr O'Brien said, has been drawing attention to the issue of LIC, State Bank of India and Adani repeatedly. The funds in LIC and SBI, he said, are at risk. The opposition contends that the two organisations are heavily invested in the Adani Group, whose market shares have taken a hit following Hindenburg's allegations of financial fraud and stocks manipulation, strongly refuted by the Adani Group.

In an exclusive interview to NDTV, Finance Secretary TV Somanathan has said the ""SBI and LIC's exposure to any given company is far below the level where it should be a concern to any investor"".

""It is tiny. The fate of one company will not affect any of these institutions significantly and therefore there is absolutely no cause for concern for either depositors or policyholders or investors in any of the nationalised banks or insurance companies,"" he had said.

The Congress has alleged that the SBI and LIC were ""forced"" to make investments to save the Adani Group, putting people's life savings in danger.

""LIC is losing about Rs 1,000 crore every day in its investments due to the fall in Adani Group's shares. The country is asking -- under whose pressure LIC-SBI invested public money in Adani,"" Rahul Gandhi had tweeted earlier.

While there were differences within the opposition on whether a Joint Parliamentary Committee or a Supreme Court-appointed committee should investigate the Adani issue, there was complete unity on the need for an investigation, Mr O'Brien said.

The Trinamool, he said, had taken a ""conscious decision"" on seeking a Supreme Court-appointed committee, since the chairperson of any Joint Parliamentary Committee is a BJP member. ""We looked at the history of JPC for the last 12 JPCs. It is putting the matter under the carpet,"" he said.

Last month, the Supreme Court had said interests of Indian investors need to be protected in view of the market volatility in the backdrop of the Adani share price drop. Some reports estimated that Indian investors have lost several lakh crores of rupees since.

The court has set up a six-member panel to look into regulatory mechanisms to protect investors' interest. The committee, headed by retired judge Abhay Manohar Sapre, will include veteran bankers KV Kamath and OP Bhat, Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani, and retired Justice JP Devdhar.","The Trinamool, Mr O'Brien told the media, has been drawing attention to three issues since the last session of parliament -- one of which is the Adani-Hindenburg row.

Further, she said the five public sector general insurance companies have informed that they do not have loan/credit exposure to the Adani Group.

When asked about exposure by banks, Sitharaman said the RBI Act bars giving information about specific borrowers. However, she quoted banks who have informed that loans are sanctioned after assessing the viability of projects, prospective cash flows, risk factors and availability of adequate security, and repayment of loans are ensured by the revenue generated by the project and not by the market capitalisation of the company.

This rare footage of Gautam Adani is from an airport where he is boarding his private jet. Adani gets out of his luxurious BMW 7-Series sedan right in front of his private jet – Bombardier Global 6500.

The footage is from Indira Gandi International airport in New Delhi. The video shows Gautam Adani getting off his new-generation BMW 7-Series and getting into his private jet. The Adani Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jugeshinder Singh was also spotted boarding the private jet with Gautam Adani.

Adani has been spotted with a few cars in the past. He recently bought a Land Rover Range Rover Long Wheelbase (LWB) that is stationed in Gujarat. But it seems like Adani has always preferred the BMW 7-Series over other vehicles. Adani was spotted with an old 7-Series many years ago. This is the first time that the billionaire is spotted with the new-generation BMW 7-Series.

Adani and Singh quickly got out of the car and boarded the Bombardier Global 6500, which can cost $53 million or around Rs 500 crore. The private jet has the Adani company logo complete with the pinstripe and the call sign of VT-AGL.

BMW 7-Series M Sport

This seems like the flagship deep blue shade of the 7-Series. The flagship 4-door saloon from the German car manufacturer is loaded with luxury features and offers acres of space inside. Even though the sedan was spotted only a few seconds, we think that it is the 740 Li M Sport variant.

The car gets a price tag of around Rs 1.5 crore, ex-showroom. It comes with features like a fully digital instrument cluster, leather upholstery, electric sunroof, 4 individual zone climate control system, electrically adjustable seats with memory function, remote control parking, seat massagers, rear seat entertainment screen and much more.

The BMW 740 Li M Sport is powered by a 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged in-line 6-cylinder engine. The petrol engine generates a maximum power of 333 Bhp and a peak torque of 450 Nm. It gets paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. It is an AWD car and many Bollywood celebrities already own this model.

Also owns the Range Rover LWB

Gautam Adani also owns the Land Rover Range Rover Autobiography LWB. It is one of the most luxurious vehicles available in the market and comes powered by a 3.0-litre diesel engine. The in-line six-cylinder engine produces a maximum power of 346 Bhp and a peak torque of 700 Nm. It comes with an 8-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel drive as a standard feature.

The cabin of the Range Rover LWB gets a dual-tone black and beige finish. It gets leather upholstery and brushed aluminium inserts, wood inlays and black piano inserts.

The BSE Sensex dropped 344.29 points, or 0.59 per cent, to 57,555.90. The NSE Nifty plunged over 71 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 16,972.15



Select stocks such as Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, Tata Steel and Lupin were on traders' radar. Here is what Laxmikant Shukla, Technical Research Analyst at YES Securities has to say on the three stocks ahead of Thursday's trading session.

Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone | Buy | Target Price: Rs 760 | Support: Rs 610

After witnessing a sharp correction, Adani Ports has given a strong pullback. The stock has breached 20- and 50-DMAs on the daily chart, indicating strength. The scrip has started consolidating in the Rs 660-640 zone and is maintaining its support of Rs 620 with decent volume. From the indicator point of view, the daily RSI has made a bullish crossover, confirming the bullish stance. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 675-665 with an upside target of Rs 760. One can keep a stop loss of Rs 610 on a closing basis.



Tata Steel | Buy | Target Price: Rs 124 | Support: Rs 101

Tata Steel looks lucrative after showing correction around 17 per cent since it hit a high of Rs 124 January 19. The stock has bottomed out near the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous leg from the support zone of Rs 101-103. Further, the upside movement is getting better with the RSI indicating a decent prominent reversal pattern from the highly oversold zone. A bullish crossover on MACD is signalling ‘buy’. One can buy and accumulate the stock for an upside initial target of Rs 116, keeping a stop loss at Rs 101 on a closing basis. Any further strength in Tata Steel can lift on the counter to Rs 124 level.



Lupin | Caution | Resistance: Rs 720 | Support: Rs 635

Lupin has given a rising channel breakdown from its swing high of Rs 785. It has fallen more than 16 per cent from its recent swing high. The sharp selloff has dragged it below all its significant moving averages. Going ahead, if the support zone of Rs 645-635 is protected, an oversold bounce shall be expected towards Rs 720 levels where its upcoming resistance stands. On the flip side, a failure to hold the mentioned support would weaken the stock further and it can slip down till Rs 580-590 zone.

The newspaper reported that the company is going to focus on the projects which have already started.

The group has cut its growth target and capital expenditure after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, in its report, accused the company of accounting fraud, stock manipulation and improper use of offshore entities. Adani has strongly denied the allegations.

It also withdrew a Rs 20,000-crore share sale, which was fully subscribed.

The research firm said that four of the Adani firms – Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Enterprises – have negative free cash flows.

Negative free cash flow means that a business has more outgoing money than incoming, and that sales alone cannot cover the expenses. So, the business needs money from investments and financing to make up the difference.

Following the Hindenburg report, Adani Group faced a stock rout which halved the company’s market valuation. And the company started prepaying share-backed loans, possibly, to regain investors’ confidence.

Meanwhile, it’s halting some proposed investments and acquisitions.

For instance, Adani Power called off the acquisition of DB Power for around Rs 7,000 crore after missing the latest deadline to complete the transaction, the Financial Times reported on February 16.

The conglomerate, in its quarterly earnings calls, had said that it would scale back capital expenditure and won’t make any new commitments till the volatility period settles.

Among the projects the group has decided to delay are under Adani New Industries Ltd, Mint reported.

This comes after TotalEnergies put a hold on its $50-billion hydrogen project investment in Adani Group after Hindenburg Research released its report. The French oil giant was expected to buy a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Ltd for $50 billion (around Rs 4.1 lakh crore) to be invested for over 10 years.

“It makes no sense to add more (projects) until there is clarity. Adani has to explain the allegations [by Hindenburg Research],” chief executive of the French oil giant Patrick Pouyanne said, the Hindu Businessline reported.

Separately, the Financial Times reported that Adani Group halted the $847 million (approximately Rs 7,000 crore) acquisition of a coal-fired power station in India.

The report added that it’s a sign that the billionaire’s business empire is slowing down spending following a short seller attack.

Adani Group had in August last year agreed to buy DB Power, and its parent company Diliigent Power Ltd.

Diliigent Power has set up a coal-fired power plant in Chhattisgarh, through DB Power, which is a special purpose vehicle. Diliigent’s owners also run newspaper business, the Bhaskar Group.

Meanwhile, Adani Group has been prepaying some loans in the form of share-backed pledges, commercial papers, etc.

The company prepaid loans worth $1.11 billion (approximately Rs 9,200 crore) on February 6, thus releasing pledged shares ahead of their maturity of September 2024.

It also repaid a part of its commercial papers from some domestic mutual funds ahead of their maturity, the Morning Context reported. Commercial papers are unsecured, short-term debt instruments issued by companies to finance short-term liabilities.

The move is, however, one of the ways to convey that all is well in the company. Otherwise, buying back CPs doesn’t make much sense, an executive at a fund house with exposure to Adani Group’s CPs told the Morning Context.

On March 13, Monday, out of the seven Adani stocks, three were in the red.

Adani Enterprises was down by 1.20%, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone by 2.42%, and Adani Wilmar 3.95% on the BSE. Adani Transmission was up by 5%, Adani Power 4.99%, Adani Green 5%, and Adani Total Gas 5%.

Adani Group stocks had taken a beating on the bourses after US-based activist short-seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share price manipulation, against the Gautam Adani-led group, which has dismissed the allegations as lies.

The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

“Our government has no confusion on the matter. What we are saying is that the Supreme Court has constituted a committee to investigate it and people should trust the judicial process,"" Shah said.

“Even then, if you think the report is not correct, then one should raise the matter or protest against it. Both SEBI and the Supreme Court will be doing parallel probes and the SEBI has already told the Supreme Court that it is investigating the matter,” the home minister said.

Shah said the current logjam in Parliament can be resolved if the opposition comes for talks, adding the government will go “two steps ahead” if the opposition takes “two steps forward”.

Shah also said there are certain issues which are above politics and even former prime minister Indira Gandhi had refused to discuss domestic politics in foreign land.

""Let the two sides sit before the Speaker and discuss. They should come two steps forward and we will go two steps ahead. Then Parliament will start running. But you just hold the press conference and do nothing, it can't go like that,"" he said.

The home minister said a parliamentary system can't run with only treasury or only opposition as both have to talk to each other.

'Modi to become PM for 3rd consecutive term in 2024'

Shah said the BJP-led NDA will form government again in 2024 and Narendra Modi will become prime minister for a third consecutive term. Shah also said ever since the Modi government came to power, issues related to three hotspots -- Jammu and Kashmir, the Northeast and Naxal -- were by and large resolved.

Since a surgical strike was carried out against terrorists inside Pakistan, no foreign power dared to interfere in the internal affairs of the country, the home minister said.

Asked about the number of seats the NDA will get in the 2024 general elections, the minister said it would be more than 2019. The BJP got 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and the NDA got over 350 seats out of the total 543 Lok Sabha constituencies.

Details here,"Adani Group's two stocks will be put under the first stage of the long-term additional surveillance measures (ASM) from Monday (20 March 2023), according to stock exchanges.

The BSE and NSE in their circulars said the two securities will be moved from the long-term ASM framework Stage II to Stage I from March 20.

Last week, both NDTV and Adani Green Energy were put under the long-term ASM framework Stage II from Stage I.

Yesterday, the ports-to-power conglomerate's three stocks were removed from the National Stock exchange's short-term ASM framework. These included Adani Power, Adani Wilmar, and Adani Enterprises, respectively.

Last month, Adani Ports and SEZ, and Ambuja Cements were also placed under the short-term additional surveillance measure to control stocks' volatility.

ASM is an initiative by Sebi and exchanges wherein the securities are moved to the either short-term or long-term framework to protect the interest of investors. Adani Group's stock has been put under the ASM framework due to high volatility post the HIndenburg's report.

In the short-term ASM, there are two stages. Stocks are retained in each stage as applicable for a minimum period of 5/15 trading sessions and are eligible for review from the 6th/16th trading day onwards.

The securities are further monitored and moved in trade-to-trade (T2T Segment) and 100% of traded value will get blocked as margins, which means that no intraday leverage is given.

The parameters for shortlisting securities under the ASM framework include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close-to-close price variation, and price earning ratio.

On Friday, seven of Adani Group's stocks were settled in green while four closed in the red.

The shares of Adani Transmission spurted 5% to settle at ₹1024.85, and Adani Wilmar climbed 1.52% to close at ₹427.35 on the BSE.

The market valuation of Adani transmission increased to ₹1,14,321.27 crore, and that of Adani Transmission jumped to ₹55,541.77 crore.

Adani Power climbed 1.20% to close at ₹199.95, and Ambuja Cements ended on a flat note at ₹378.25 each share.

Also, the shares of flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) gained 1.88% to settle at ₹1,877.15 apiece on the bourse.

Besides, shares of Adani Green Energy rose by 4.99% to close at ₹816.80. However, NDTV declined 1.63% to end at ₹205.70.

The 30-share BSE Sensex gained 355.06 points or 0.62% higher to settle at 57,989.90 points. The broader NSE Nifty rose 0.67% to end at 17,100.

After taking a beating on the bourses, following the report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, the group stocks had recovered. However, amid sluggish broader market trends, the group's stocks have declined in the last few trading sessions.

The report had made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against it.

The group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.","Last week, both NDTV and Adani Green Energy were put under the long-term ASM framework Stage II from Stage I.

""Sad. Uninformed & deliberate attempt to mislead by Hon MP of Indian parliament,"" tweeted Singh against Moitra's tweet.

Her tweet came hours after Adani Group clarified that Vinod Adani is part of the promoter group, after questions were raised about his status following a report by The Morning Context, which said Vinod Adani is the ultimate beneficiary of ACC and Ambuja Cements, not Adani Group. US short seller Hindenburg Research also named him prominently in its scathing report on the Adani Group.

The group had last year acquired Swiss-based Holcim’s cement businesses in India – Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd – for $10.5 billion (around Rs 85,000 crore).

'We would like to submit that Gautam Adani and Rajesh Adani are individual promoters of various listed entities within the Adani group and Vinod Adani is an immediate relative of the individual promoters,'' the group's flagship arm Adani Enterprises said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday.

Accordingly, as per the applicable Indian regulations, ''Vinod Adani is part of the 'promoter group' of various listed entities within the Adani group.'' In response to Hindenburg questioning the role of Vinod Adani, 74, in the Adani group where it alleged ''brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud'' and use of offshore shell companies to inflate stock prices, the apples-to-airport conglomerate had in January said that ''Vinod Adani does not hold any managerial position in Adani listed entities or their subsidiaries and has no role in their day to day affairs.'' ''We reiterate that any transactions by the Adani portfolio companies with any related party have been duly identified and disclosed as related party transactions in compliance with Indian laws and standard and have been carried out on arm's length terms,'' it had said.

When asked by a Twitter user what his agrument is, Singh said: ""Dear Sir, promoter is defined to outline corporate control and thus behaviour in the public markets including type of disclosure. Promoter can be or not be in management or on boards. Defintion of promoter and management or board positions are 2 different things.""

Defintion of promoter and management or baord positions are 2 different things — Jugeshinder Robbie Singh (@jugeshinder) March 16, 2023

Hindenburg Research had alleged that Vinod Adani was responsible for creating and managing a vast network of offshore shell entities meant for stock parking, market manipulation and laundering money, to help the conglomerate's companies maintain their appearance of financial health.

The group has denied all Hindenburg allegations, calling them ''malicious'', ''baseless'' and a ''calculated attack on India'' but it still led to a $130-billion erosion of m-cap of the listed Adani firms.

Vinod Adani is widely reported to be working out of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Regulatory filings show he is a Cypriot national.

When Adani Group bought Swiss giant Holcim AG's stake in Ambuja Cements and ACC, the deal was completed via a Mauritius-based entity called Endeavour Trade and Investment.

In the filing, Adani Group said the fact that Vinod Adani was part of the promoter group had been submitted to Indian regulatory authorities from time to time in various disclosures.

''Further, the fact that Endeavour Trade and Investment Limited (an entity controlled by Vinod Adani), the acquirer of ACC Limited and Ambuja Cements Limited, belongs to the Adani group has been disclosed in the public offer document,'' it added.

There were also reports that the group was looking to refinance $1.15 billion of overseas-listed bonds at two group firms, Adani Green Energy and Adani Ports & SEZ - via private placements. The broader market sentiment too was weak, due to concerns over the US banking system, ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting later this week.

At 9.25 am, shares of Adani Enterprises were trading 3.44 per cent lower at Rs 1,812.55. Adani Ports declined 1.52 per cent to Rs 669.75. Adani Power was down 3.18 per cent at Rs 193.60. Adani Transmission slipped 2.8 per cent to Rs 996.20. Adani Green Energy fell 1.4 per cent while Adani Total Gas and Adani dropped 2.71 per cent and 1.59 per cent, respectively. Cement stocks Ambuja Cements and ACC declined 1.07 per cent and 0.56 per cent, respectively. NDTV, another group stock, fell 0.95 per cent.

A PTI report suggested that the Gautam Adani-led group has decided not to pursue the Gujarat project, for the time being. It has sent emails to vendors and suppliers to suspend all activities on an immediate basis, PTI reported. The Adani group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises had in 2021 incorporated Mundra Petrochem, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for setting up a greenfield coal-to-PVC plant at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) land in Kutch, Gujarat.

Recently, the Adani group cancelled a Rs 7,017 crore coal plant purchase and shelved plans to bid for a stake in power trader PTC India. The fresh report on the 1 million tonnes per annum Green PVC project, if true, would add to the group's recent steps to downsize its debts.

Meanwhile, a report by the ET suggested the group is engaged in exploratory talks with potential overseas investors, such as global insurance firms, to privately place longer-tenor bonds of up to 30-year maturities. The bonds will carry fixed coupon rates.

The report suggested that the group has shortlisted two bond tranches, amounting to $500 million and $650 million, respectively, of Adani Green Energy and Adani Ports & SEZ, to begin with. The group believes there will be a reasonably good appetite for its bonds in the private market since most of the debt is backed by strong cash flows, as per the ET report.

The Adani group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises had in 2021 incorporated Mundra Petrochem, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for setting up a greenfield coal-to-PVC plant at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) land in Kutch, Gujarat.
Adani group shares have recovered of late, as the company made several clarifications and prepaid loans in a bid to allay investor concerns.

This decision comes two months after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report accusing the Adani group of large-scale accounting fraud and stock manipulation, leading to serious concerns and a free fall in Adani group companies’ share prices. The Gautam Adani-led conglomerate has denied these allegations.

According to PTI, Adani Enterprises Ltd had in 2021 incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Mundra Petrochem Ltd, to set up a greenfield coal-to-PVC plant at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone land in Kutch district. The group has sent emails to vendors and suppliers, telling them to “suspend all activities” on an immediate basis “till further notice”.

The unit was to have a poly-vinyl-chloride (PVC) production capacity of 2,000 kilo tonne per annum requiring 3.1 million tonne per annum of coal that was to be imported from Australia, Russia and other countries. PVC demand in India has been rising.

The management, according to PTI, is “re-evaluating various project/s being implemented at group level in different business verticals. Based on future cashflow and finance, some of the project/s are being re-evaluated for its continuation and revision in timeline”.

An AEL spokesperson told PTI, “The balance sheet of each of our independent portfolio companies is very strong. We have industry-leading project development and execution capabilities, strong corporate governance, secure assets, strong cashflows, and our business plan is fully funded. We remain focused on executing our previously outlined strategy to create value for our stakeholders.”

This seems to be part of the Adani group’s steps to try and come out of the crisis it has found itself in since January 24, with about $140 billion dollars of the group’s market value disappearing. In order to allay investor concerns, the group is trying to repay some of its loans.

Previously, the group has cancelled a Rs 7,000 crore coal plant purchase and also taken back its bid for stake in power trader PTC. Reports also said the group is selling its stake in Ambuja Cement – and it was revealed that this particular company is actually owned by Vinod Adani, Gautam’s brother.

After the publication of the Hindenburg report, several investigations have raised further questions about the group’s functioning. The matter has also been raised repeatedly in parliament by opposition parties, who have asked why investigative agencies are not probing the company.","New Delhi: As concerns over its finances continue, the Adani group has suspended work on a Rs 34,900 crore petrochemichal project in Mundra, Gujarat.

Adani Group stocks had taken a beating on the bourses after US-based activist short-seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share price manipulation, against the Gautam Adani-led group, which has dismissed the allegations as lies.

The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

“Our government has no confusion on the matter. What we are saying is that the Supreme Court has constituted a committee to investigate it and people should trust the judicial process,"" Shah said.

Shah added that if anyone has proof, he or she should submit it before the Supreme Court committee.

He also assured that “no one should be spared if something wrong has happened” and everyone should trust the judicial process.

“Even then, if you think the report is not correct, then one should raise the matter or protest against it. Both SEBI and the Supreme Court will be doing parallel probes and the SEBI has already told the Supreme Court that it is investigating the matter,” the home minister said.

Parliament logjam can be resolved if…: says Amit Shah

Shah said the current logjam in Parliament can be resolved if the opposition comes for talks, adding the government will go “two steps ahead” if the opposition takes “two steps forward”.

Shah also said there are certain issues which are above politics and even former prime minister Indira Gandhi had refused to discuss domestic politics in foreign land.

""Let the two sides sit before the Speaker and discuss. They should come two steps forward and we will go two steps ahead. Then Parliament will start running. But you just hold the press conference and do nothing, it can't go like that,"" he said.

The home minister said a parliamentary system can't run with only treasury or only opposition as both have to talk to each other.

'Modi to become PM for 3rd consecutive term in 2024'

Shah said the BJP-led NDA will form government again in 2024 and Narendra Modi will become prime minister for a third consecutive term. Shah also said ever since the Modi government came to power, issues related to three hotspots -- Jammu and Kashmir, the Northeast and Naxal -- were by and large resolved.

Since a surgical strike was carried out against terrorists inside Pakistan, no foreign power dared to interfere in the internal affairs of the country, the home minister said.

Asked about the number of seats the NDA will get in the 2024 general elections, the minister said it would be more than 2019. The BJP got 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and the NDA got over 350 seats out of the total 543 Lok Sabha constituencies.

Details here,"Adani Group's two stocks will be put under the first stage of the long-term additional surveillance measures (ASM) from Monday (20 March 2023), according to stock exchanges.

The BSE and NSE in their circulars said the two securities will be moved from the long-term ASM framework Stage II to Stage I from March 20.

Last week, both NDTV and Adani Green Energy were put under the long-term ASM framework Stage II from Stage I.

Yesterday, the ports-to-power conglomerate's three stocks were removed from the National Stock exchange's short-term ASM framework. These included Adani Power, Adani Wilmar, and Adani Enterprises, respectively.

Last month, Adani Ports and SEZ, and Ambuja Cements were also placed under the short-term additional surveillance measure to control stocks' volatility.

ASM is an initiative by Sebi and exchanges wherein the securities are moved to the either short-term or long-term framework to protect the interest of investors. Adani Group's stock has been put under the ASM framework due to high volatility post the HIndenburg's report.

In the short-term ASM, there are two stages. Stocks are retained in each stage as applicable for a minimum period of 5/15 trading sessions and are eligible for review from the 6th/16th trading day onwards.

The securities are further monitored and moved in trade-to-trade (T2T Segment) and 100% of traded value will get blocked as margins, which means that no intraday leverage is given.

The parameters for shortlisting securities under the ASM framework include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close-to-close price variation, and price earning ratio.

On Friday, seven of Adani Group's stocks were settled in green while four closed in the red.

The shares of Adani Transmission spurted 5% to settle at ₹1024.85, and Adani Wilmar climbed 1.52% to close at ₹427.35 on the BSE.

The market valuation of Adani transmission increased to ₹1,14,321.27 crore, and that of Adani Transmission jumped to ₹55,541.77 crore.

Adani Power climbed 1.20% to close at ₹199.95, and Ambuja Cements ended on a flat note at ₹378.25 each share.

Also, the shares of flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) gained 1.88% to settle at ₹1,877.15 apiece on the bourse.

Besides, shares of Adani Green Energy rose by 4.99% to close at ₹816.80. However, NDTV declined 1.63% to end at ₹205.70.

The 30-share BSE Sensex gained 355.06 points or 0.62% higher to settle at 57,989.90 points. The broader NSE Nifty rose 0.67% to end at 17,100.

After taking a beating on the bourses, following the report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, the group stocks had recovered. However, amid sluggish broader market trends, the group's stocks have declined in the last few trading sessions.

The report had made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against it.

Sad. Uninformed & deliberate attempt to mislead by Hon MP of Indian parliament. https://t.co/RQ2wD3sDZd March 16, 2023

Her tweet came hours after Adani Group clarified that Vinod Adani is part of the promoter group, after questions were raised about his status following a report by The Morning Context, which said Vinod Adani is the ultimate beneficiary of ACC and Ambuja Cements, not Adani Group. US short seller Hindenburg Research also named him prominently in its scathing report on the Adani Group.

The group had last year acquired Swiss-based Holcim’s cement businesses in India – Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd – for $10.5 billion (around Rs 85,000 crore).

'We would like to submit that Gautam Adani and Rajesh Adani are individual promoters of various listed entities within the Adani group and Vinod Adani is an immediate relative of the individual promoters,'' the group's flagship arm Adani Enterprises said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday.

Accordingly, as per the applicable Indian regulations, ''Vinod Adani is part of the 'promoter group' of various listed entities within the Adani group.'' In response to Hindenburg questioning the role of Vinod Adani, 74, in the Adani group where it alleged ''brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud'' and use of offshore shell companies to inflate stock prices, the apples-to-airport conglomerate had in January said that ''Vinod Adani does not hold any managerial position in Adani listed entities or their subsidiaries and has no role in their day to day affairs.'' ''We reiterate that any transactions by the Adani portfolio companies with any related party have been duly identified and disclosed as related party transactions in compliance with Indian laws and standard and have been carried out on arm's length terms,'' it had said.

When asked by a Twitter user what his agrument is, Singh said: ""Dear Sir, promoter is defined to outline corporate control and thus behaviour in the public markets including type of disclosure. Promoter can be or not be in management or on boards. Defintion of promoter and management or board positions are 2 different things.""

Defintion of promoter and management or baord positions are 2 different things — Jugeshinder Robbie Singh (@jugeshinder) March 16, 2023

Hindenburg Research had alleged that Vinod Adani was responsible for creating and managing a vast network of offshore shell entities meant for stock parking, market manipulation and laundering money, to help the conglomerate's companies maintain their appearance of financial health.

The group has denied all Hindenburg allegations, calling them ''malicious'', ''baseless'' and a ''calculated attack on India'' but it still led to a $130-billion erosion of m-cap of the listed Adani firms.

Vinod Adani is widely reported to be working out of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Regulatory filings show he is a Cypriot national.

When Adani Group bought Swiss giant Holcim AG's stake in Ambuja Cements and ACC, the deal was completed via a Mauritius-based entity called Endeavour Trade and Investment.

In the filing, Adani Group said the fact that Vinod Adani was part of the promoter group had been submitted to Indian regulatory authorities from time to time in various disclosures.

''Further, the fact that Endeavour Trade and Investment Limited (an entity controlled by Vinod Adani), the acquirer of ACC Limited and Ambuja Cements Limited, belongs to the Adani group has been disclosed in the public offer document,'' it added.

Cement stocks Ambuja Cements and ACC declined 1.07 per cent and 0.56 per cent, respectively. NDTV, another group stock, fell 0.95 per cent.

A PTI report suggested that the Gautam Adani-led group has decided not to pursue the Gujarat project, for the time being. It has sent emails to vendors and suppliers to suspend all activities on an immediate basis, PTI reported. The Adani group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises had in 2021 incorporated Mundra Petrochem, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for setting up a greenfield coal-to-PVC plant at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) land in Kutch, Gujarat.

Recently, the Adani group cancelled a Rs 7,017 crore coal plant purchase and shelved plans to bid for a stake in power trader PTC India. The fresh report on the 1 million tonnes per annum Green PVC project, if true, would add to the group's recent steps to downsize its debts.

Meanwhile, a report by the ET suggested the group is engaged in exploratory talks with potential overseas investors, such as global insurance firms, to privately place longer-tenor bonds of up to 30-year maturities. The bonds will carry fixed coupon rates.

The report suggested that the group has shortlisted two bond tranches, amounting to $500 million and $650 million, respectively, of Adani Green Energy and Adani Ports & SEZ, to begin with. The group believes there will be a reasonably good appetite for its bonds in the private market since most of the debt is backed by strong cash flows, as per the ET report.

Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) branding those who raise questions against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adani Group head Gautam Adani as anti-national, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury questioned the Union government’s reluctance to agree to the Opposition’s demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) into alleged irregularities in the corporate group.

He was speaking at a public meeting marking the conclusion of the Statewide Janakeeya Prathirodha Yatra led by CPI(M) State secretary M.V. Govindan here on Saturday.

“In the days of Emergency, we heard the slogan of Indira is India and India is Indira. Today, Modi is giving us the slogan of Modi-Adani are India and India is Modi-Adani. The people of India will give them a fitting reply, as they had given Indira Gandhi back then with the removal of the government from office. Questioning the government of the day is the duty of every Indian patriot. This dangerous equation has to be defeated. On the one hand, their government says nothing is wrong with the dealings of the Adani group. Yet, they are not allowing the JPC, because they have a lot to hide,” Mr. Yechury said.

“When the BJP was in Opposition, Parliament was stalled for an entire session to demand a JPC for the 2G scam, which was constituted. Each JPC has given recommendations that were helpful for the system,” said Mr. Yechury.

He said the communal-corporate nexus that had emerged under the Modi government was destroying the four pillars of the country’s Constitutional order — secular democracy, economic self sovereignty, social justice, and federalism. The worst form of crony capitalism had been unleashed, as exemplified by the Adani scam.

“The government is now using various agencies to target and intimidate Opposition leaders. Since 2014, more than 3,554 cases have been filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Of these, only 23 received convictions in court. Miraculously, the cases against those leaders who join the BJP vanish immediately. The BJP has found a new principle in democracy that whoever wins the elections, the BJP will form the government,” he said.","He was speaking at a public meeting marking the conclusion of the Statewide Janakeeya Prathirodha Yatra led by CPI(M) State secretary M.V.

But Tata, Birla, Ambani, Adani, have given India brandless growth","The Adani controversy brings to our attention some related aspects of India’s political economy. The most immediate one is the opposition’s allegation of cronyism. Which, when elaborated, becomes a larger theme encompassing the top four or five leaders of corporate India.

You can add Ambani, Tata, Birla, and Vedanta to the list. All these qualify to be called conglomerates. They all have interests in diverse fields. This, to be sure, isn’t a definitive or comprehensive list.

The Tatas, for example, are often described as a salt-to-software group. They produce automobiles and military aircraft, run a massive and diverse airline business now, and also make steel.

Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Group spans a wide range of businesses too, from refining to telecom as the main course, to retail and even biosciences research, and some media thrown in the dessert trolley.

The Aditya Birla Group has interests in metals (aluminium in particular), telecom, cement, yarns and more. Vedanta is still mostly into metals but is now on the energy (oil and gas production) radar too.

All these have three things in common.

One, they are all legacy or at least family-controlled enterprises. Reliance (Ambani) and Birla are empires founded by the previous generations. Vedanta and Adani have first-generation founders who control their businesses directly. The extent to which members of the family are in control of key businesses can vary, from Adani at one extreme to Tata at the other.

Two, all these have most of their businesses in areas where the government overhang is heavy and decisive. These are highly regulated areas and often — especially in the case of Adani — monopolies by definition. Think Mumbai airport and electricity distribution, or Mundra Port, or the mega plants with power purchase agreements. The same applies to refining and telecom, mining and oilfield concessions. A direct and extensive interaction with the state is critical to these.

Third, and the most important for this week’s discussion, is that none of them owns a truly global Indian brand. There will be protests from the Tatas, I understand, because they have the Taj Hotels and now Air India is back with them. I’d say with some humility that Taj is still not a hotel brand to awe the world — probably because they work in so many categories, from super-luxury Palaces to the very working-class Ginger. And Air India was felled by the sarkari kiss of death decades ago, and it will take some doing now to bring it back to its old glory.

Much of the criticism Adani has faced in particular stems from his proximity to the Modi government, especially given how critical working with the state is for his main businesses. If running ports on India’s coast is a business fully regulated by the government, buying port assets overseas is impossible without a supportive government. Whether that’s a good thing or bad isn’t the question. In polarised debate it can often be seen as bordering on cronyism.

The Congress, for example, cites this as a case of the Modi government running foreign policy to “serve their friend Adani’s interest”. Others might see it as important that any government work closely with powerful Indian conglomerates to compete overseas, especially with a rampant China with its Belt and Road Initiative and unlimited treasury.

Similarly, think of the airports, highways, railways, tunnels, metros and much else that is being built in India now, as The Economist noted in its latest issue. You’ll need companies that have deep pockets and large balance sheets to build so much infrastructure.

Would you leave it to Bechtels of the world to come and do it for you, or would you rather have Indian conglomerates do it? Nobody can do it without working closely with the government, so that isn’t the issue. The debate, therefore, has to be about whether there is a level playing field for all comers. The Bechtels included.

This state-corporate “cooperation” (nexus if you are conspiratorially minded) didn’t begin with the arrival of the Modi government. Many of the big licences, contracts, and even environmental clearances for the Adani Group had come in the time of the UPA. Of course, they will insist they did it fairly after asking the right questions and giving all competitors an equal chance. But the fact is, there are so many areas in a growing economy with desperate hunger for infrastructure that private capital and the state will need to work closely together.

We’ve discussed the Adani case in greater detail because it is the subject of most of today’s debate. But all these conglomerates do most of their business in India, and in areas where they can’t escape the government’s shadow. Much of their revenue is domestic as well. There are exceptions, for sure, like the Tatas’ software business.

To understand this better, look at the case of the Dhamra Port on India’s still poorly served eastern seaboard. The Tatas built it in the face of heavy odds, in particular opposition from environmental activists who had a much greater say under the UPA dispensation. There were questions and litigation, ranging from whether it was consuming reserved forest land to the feared destruction of the nesting sites of Olive Ridley turtles.

The legal clearances did finally come in the UPA era, if after much delay because — despite its devotion to environmental activism — that government’s top leaders were too wise not to understand the vital need for another efficient port in the east. The UPA didn’t block it. That the Tatas finally sold it to the Adanis is another story. While many would believe the insinuation that the Tatas must’ve been arm-twisted into selling it to the Adanis, it wouldn’t pass a most elementary fact check. The deal was negotiated and concluded under UPA-II and announced on 16 May, 2014, as election results had just begun to come in.

The third point is that the failure of these super-powerful Indian corporations to build global brands is a real disappointment. We can classify brands broadly in three categories: country, company and product brands respectively. In the first category, India has some — yoga, ayurveda, spirituality maybe. Engineering and maths talent, IITs and IIMs, generic pharma. You can add more to the list.

There are powerful Indian company brands known across the world, at least in business circles: Tata, Reliance, Vedanta and some companies within the conglomerates, like TCS. Then Infosys, Wipro, HCL and other tech companies.

None of them, however, has created a product brand that rules the world. India does not have a purely homemade car, a two-wheeler, a software or operating system, not even a perfume or a beverage. We are collecting GI tags for scores of products — mostly agri and handicrafts — and yet not a brand that looks out from shop shelves globally.

Corporate India has failed to create a garment brand, and almost all that our factories produce and export is sold under the labels of international store chains. To that extent, our garment makers are also doing outsourced work. Which is precisely what the Modi government is now promising in its larger manufacturing push with incentives like PLI and other concessions.

While it’s great that India is now making a lot of mobile phones for export, none of these carries an Indian brand name. The Chinese and Koreans, on the other hand, have spawned a half-dozen brands that dominate global markets. The Modi government’s manufacturing push is very good and necessary, but basically it is pushing Indian manufacturing in the same direction as our software (services) industry: outsourcing.

Cronyism is abhorrent and it’s good that it’s now being debated so robustly. But the much bigger failure of these incredibly powerful, rich and successful companies, and of the state policy, lies in India’s fully brand-free economic growth.

Would you leave it to Bechtels of the world to come and do it for you, or would you rather have Indian conglomerates do it?
But all these conglomerates do most of their business in India, and in areas where they can’t escape the government’s shadow.

On March 15, 16 Opposition parties including the Congress, Aam Admi Party and Bharat Rashtra Samithi marched from Parliament to submit a complaint to the ED against the Adani Group, alleging “serious corporate fraud, political corruption, stock-price manipulation and the misuse and monopolization of public resources”.

In the meeting before the march, a NCP representative was present but did not sign the complaint. The NCP had reservations on an issue related to a development project in Mumbai, as it was a pet project of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in which the erstwhile Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress were partners, two Congress leaders said, requesting anonymity.

“The NCP leader present in the meeting told us that they are with us in spirit but not in body, indicating their reluctance to join the march,” said a Congress leader. Another opposition leader present in the meeting said that the NCP leaders tried to get party supremo Sharad Pawar sign the petition, but couldn’t reach him.

“The NCP is a trusted ally of the Congress, unlike the Trinamool. The TMC doesn’t attend any meeting of the opposition and tried to dilute the Adani-Hindenburg issue by demanding a court-monitored probe, even as all other opposition parties have been demanding a JPC (joint parliamentary committee),” said a second Congress leader.

In its letter to the ED, the opposition flagged the network of offshore shell companies allegedly involved in stock manipulation and money laundering, the AdiCorp’s funnelling of funds from the Adani Group back to Adani Power, the lack of investigation into the 3,000kg drugs haul from Mundra port, and the Adani Group’s improper influence to obtain concessions and contracts from governments.

After demanding a JPC and seeking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reply on a number of questions regarding the Adani Group, the Congress and key opposition parties lodged a formal complaint against the conglomerate to a federal investigative agency that investigates financial crimes.

The Congress, with many of its leaders under the ED’s scanner, reminded the agency how in the recent past it “has zealously pursued cases of alleged political favouritism including sharing concurrent jurisdiction with SEBI and CBI.” The ED on occasion works with the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the country’s market regulator, to nab violators.

On March 17, PTI had reported that the NSE and Bombay Stock Exchange has announced that three Adani group companies, Adani Enterprises, Adani Power and Adani Wilmar, will move out of the short-term additional surveillance measure (ASM), under which they were put on March 8.

This move helps safeguard investors from unusual stock movement during instances of high volatility in shares. Business Standard noted that when a stock is in the ASM list, it serves as a warning to investors about unusual activity in the stock and some trading restrictions are put on these stocks to halt unnecessary speculation.

The move was likely triggered by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research’s report in January, alleging stock manipulation and fraud against the Adani Group, which let to the group’s stocks losing at least 50% of their market value.

In February, a subsidiary of the NSE had announced the addition of five Adani Group firms into 14 Nifty indices, effective from March 30. It also retained Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and SEZ in its flagship Nifty 50 index. The move, according to The Hindu, led financial experts to seek an urgent intervention and SEBI review.

Opposition Congress claimed that even as global index providers were reviewing Adani stock positions, the NSE has bent over backwards to accommodate Adani Group’s stocks.

In the face of criticism alleging that the NSE is protecting Adani’s interests, it brought out a three-page late-night statement on Sunday saying, as quoted in a separate report by The Hindu, that there was “no human discretion in deciding on inclusion or exclusion of stocks in any of if [sic] its indices”.

Times of India noted that the statement said that the inclusion and exclusion of stocks is “based on index methodologies that are objective, non-discretionary, rules based, pre-announced and transparent.”

It added that the policies of risk assessment were all transparent, as were the rules governing the surveillance action on eligible stocks.

“Thus given the current pre-announced, transparent, rules based, automatic, non discretionary regulatory framework for surveillance measures and for index inclusion/ exclusion at NSE, no human discretion is possible for any one and this entire process and practice has been running for decades,” the NSE also said, according to The Hindu.

Various governance committees including those with external independent members are in place to approve of index changes, it noted.","This move helps safeguard investors from unusual stock movement during instances of high volatility in shares.

The occasion was the virtual inauguration of a 131.57km cross-border Indo-Bangla Friendship Pipeline, through which Bangladesh will import high-speed diesel from the Numaligarh refinery in Assam. Modi, in the presence of his counterpart Sheikh Hasina, spoke at length about the progress made in energy cooperation between their countries.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued with his silence on Adani on Saturday though he would have had every reason to mention Adani Power, whose entry into Bangladesh owed to his patronage, at an event celebrating a new phase in Delhi-Dhaka cooperation over energy.

Eight years ago, Modi had laid the groundwork for Adani Power’s entry into Bangladesh as part of India’s commitment to improving the power situation in the neighbouring country and beginning an extensive cross-border power trade.

A joint declaration issued by the external affairs ministry after Modi’s Bangladesh visit in June 2015 said: “He (Modi) also conveyed that India can be a major partner in achieving this goal and many Indian corporates have the capacity to cooperate with Bangladesh in this endeavour. He requested Prime Minister Hasina for facilitating the entry of Indian companies in the power generation, transmission and distribution sector of Bangladesh.”

Two years after Modi’s visit, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Adani Power in November 2017.

The deal was for the Indian company to supply 1,496MW of electricity from a coal-based power plant at Godda in Jharkhand.

With Adani Power (Jharkhand) having begun supplying power to Bangladesh from the Godda plant earlier this month, Modi, perceived as the architect of the cross-border power trade, would perhaps have been expected to mention the fact. But he persisted with his silence on the Adani group, which has been in the thick of controversy amid allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

The Congress accuses Modi of preferential treatment of the group because of his proximity to Adani.

“In the field of energy, our mutual cooperation has been very successful.... Today, India supplies more than 1,100MW electricity to Bangladesh,” Modi said at Saturday’s programme.

“The first unit of the Maitree super thermal power plant (a 50:50 joint venture between the BPDB and India’s NTPC) is already operational. The second unit will also be operational soon.”

Modi said the petroleum trade between the two countries had crossed $1 billion. He spoke of how the pipeline — through which Dhaka is to import diesel at a cheaper cost and with lower carbon emission — would give a push to the Bangladesh economy by facilitating the growth of both agriculture and industry.

“Under normal circumstances, a mention of the deal between Adani Power and the BPDB in the Indian Prime Minister’s address would have been natural, but we all know the controversies surrounding the group in India,” a source in Bangladesh said.

Another reason behind the act of omission could be the controversy in Bangladesh over the deal.

Segments of Bangladesh civil society and media have demanded scrapping of the purchase deal with Adani Power, calling it “unfair” and steeped in a “profiteering motive”.

Over the past one month or so, several news reports in the Bangladeshi media — based on the 163-page PPA — have contended that Dhaka would be paying through its nose for electricity from the Godda plant.

That Bangladesh authorities too had apprehensions about the cost of electricity from Adani Power (Jharkhand) became clear in recent months with the BPDB seeking revisions to the PPA, which prompted representatives of the conglomerate to rush to Dhaka at least twice to assuage the concerns.

“The Adani representatives were here last week too. They have given an assurance that the cost of electricity from their plant would be on a par with — or even cheaper than — that from other thermal power plants,” a source in Bangladesh said.

Multiple sources in the Bangladesh government said that although the PPA was “iron clad”, the process of bargaining with the Adani authorities had become easier because of the problems the conglomerate is facing in India.

“The company is likely to raise its first bill to the BPDB in April. It will become clear then that we have struck a favourable bargain after all the controversy,” a source said.

“The pipeline will play a significant role in protecting the energy security of our people and quicken the country’s development,” Hasina said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued with his silence on Adani on Saturday though he would have had every reason to mention Adani Power, whose entry into Bangladesh owed to his patronage, at an event celebrating a new phase in Delhi-Dhaka cooperation over energy.

FMCG company, Adani Wilmar, on Friday said its flagship Fortune Pulses has launched nine different varieties of natural dal. Fortune Pulses’ nine different varieties of natural dal include Arhar Dal, Moong Dal, Chana Dal, Masoor Dal {Masoor Malka (Imported)}, Kabuli Chana, Rajma Chitra, Kala Chana, Sona Moong Dal and Masoor Malka (Desi), the company said.

The brand aims to establish a strong regional presence by launching a range of pulses which are customised to the consumer preference in Northern and Eastern states of India.

“Our focus is on expanding regional relevance and consumer affinity towards Fortune across India through products adapted to match hyperlocal tastes. It is a step towards gaining the consumer’s trust in our food products and go beyond Fortune’s edible oils. We aim to establish Fortune as a reliable brand for the entire basket of staple foods by providing premium quality, value-for-money products to our customers,” says Vineeth Viswambharan, Associate Vice President, Marketing & Sales, Adani Wilmar.

The packets of Dal will be available for the consumer in 500g and 1kg packaging across all e-commerce platforms. The packets of Dal will also be available in the leading stores in the Northern and Eastern states of India, the company added.

Adani Wilmar further said that the presence of regionally customised products in its portfolio will help accelerate the process.

Pulses, also known as legumes, are one of the most preferred vegetarian food options in India, given their richness in protein. On the other hand, Adani Wilmar claims the range of pulses introduced by Fortune Pulses are unpolished, sortex-cleaned, and are low in moisture, sourced from the best of farms.

Earlier this month, Adani Wilmar launched Kohinoor Hyderabadi Biryani Kit as part of their expansion of the ready-to-cook range. The Biryani Kit aimed at helping connoisseurs prepare restaurant-quality biryani in just 30 minutes.

In January, Adani Wilmar reported its number for the December quarter. The quarter was marked by strong volume growth across all segments and gain in market share across key product categories. The company stated that it benefitted from a stronger out-of-home (OOH) consumption.

Adani Wilmar’s stock settled at Rs 427.65 apiece, up over 1.5 percent, when the market closed.

“The government at the Centre could not want to answer the questions raised by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the floor of Parliament on PM’s overseas tour with Adani, about shell companies and money lost by LIC. Hence, to deflect public attention from the issue raised by us, they resorted to disruptions proceedings in Parliament,” Baghel said.

On the BJP demanding an apology from the Congress MP over his remarks in London, Baghel said this was the first time that a ruling party was creating a ruckus in Parliament and not allowing either House to run.

“Today, no one is raising concerns on the wastage of crores of public money due to continued disruptions in Parliament. Is this not a matter to debate in Parliament?” The Chhattisgarh CM said.

Meanwhile, the logjam in Parliament continued on Friday as both the ruling and Opposition members stuck to their positions, not letting either House function.

The acrimony continued to play out even outside the Parliament, with several members of the BJP and Congress sabre-rattling over Rahul’s remarks in the UK and the Adani issue.

After the Lok Sabha went into session, Opposition members came near the Speaker’s podium to press for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the Hindenburg report against the Adani Group.

The BJP members, meanwhile, raised the chorus for an apology from Rahul Gandhi over his remarks at the Cambridge University lecture, alleging that he had maligned institutions in the country.

The Congress, meanwhile, alleged that the audio of their members was muted after they raised slogans in favour of Rahul being allowed to respond to allegations that the BJP raised against him.

The Congress members alleged that there was no audio for about 20 minutes during the parliamentary proceedings on Friday.

Government sources, however, claimed a “technical fault”.

The Rajya Sabha also saw disruptions and was adjourned for the day. The Upper House had taken up some of its listed businesses before bedlam broke.

The second part of the Budget session began on March 13. (ANI)

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s videos on industrialist Gautam Adani have fewer views despite similar user engagement as other videos, the Congress has said in a letter to YouTube. The party has further alleged that the browse feature for these specific videos seem to have been “algorithmically suppressed”.

Sam Pitroda, chairperson of the Indian Overseas Congress, has flagged the issue in a letter to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan. Mr. Gandhi’s team, Mr. Pitroda wrote in the letter, finds it a “bit bizarre and are searching for an explanation”. “They have used YouTube’s own data and analytics to show that viewership of videos of Mr. Adani are being suppressed, perhaps unwittingly and algorithmically,” he added.

To support its claim, the Congress party has also submitted a brief presentation analysing the viewership data of the video series on Mr. Adani, called ‘ Mitr Kaal’, versus his video from the Bharat Jodo Yatra.

The positive interactions of the Bharat Jodo Yatra video at 83,602 is less than that of ‘ Mitr Kaal‘ episode one at 99,197 and yet, the party pointed out that while the Bharat Jodo Yatra video got over 20 lakh views, the ‘ Mitr Kaal‘ video got only 4.78 lakh views. According to the party’s presentation, positive interactions have an 89% to increase views.

Similarly, the second episode in the series have double the interactions of Mr. Gandhi’s Cambridge video but similar number of views.

The party has alleged systematic “algorithmic suppression”. Most people see videos through the ‘YouTube Browse’ feature, where the home page throws in recommendations. In the case of Mr. Gandhi’s channel, the party claims this feature has been down since February 9.

Data compiled by independent social media analytics firm Social Blade confirms this trend in declining views of Mr. Gandhi videos. According to the firm, the monthly views for Mr. Gandhi’s videos increased from 4.6 lakh in September 2022 to over 33 million in January 2023.

However, the number of subscribers added to his channel on a 30-day rolling basis declined two-thirds compared with the previous month, and the video views in the last 30 days have decreased by over 59%.

The Adani Group’s rise to become one of the top business empires in the world might have seen an unprecedented surge in the last nine years

By Telangana Today Published Date - 08:35 PM, Sun - 19 March 23

The Adani Group’s rise to become one of the top business empires in the world might have seen an unprecedented surge in the last nine years. But fraud, right from siphoning funds offshore and market manipulation of share prices of the group in India, are nothing new to the group.

In fact, the Adani Group’s shady affairs were revealed as early as in 1999, when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence arrested Rajesh Adani, a younger brother of Gautam Adani and currently the managing director of the Adani Group, on charges of evading customs duties. He was arrested several times again, on charges of customs fraud too, most recently in 2013.

The DRI also investigated the 2004-06 diamond scam, in which Rajesh Adani and Gautam Adani’s brother-in-law Samir Vora were accused of circular trading of diamonds and over-invoicing so as to siphon funds to tax havens like Dubai and Singapore, and also of fraudulently claiming export subsidies.

In 2013, the Commissioner of Customs imposed fines on Rajesh Adani, Samir Vora, Adani Enterprises and five diamond trading companies linked to the Adani Group.

However, in 2015, soon after the Modi government came to power, the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) dismissed the findings of investigations that spanned several years.

Much before that, in 2007, the Adani Group was banned by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) from participation in the securities market for two years.

The SEBI passed the order after it found the involvement of promoters of Adani — along with controversial stock broker Ketan Parekh and his associates — in the price rigging of Adani stocks between October 1999 and March 2001.

DRI investigation still pending before SC



In 2013-14, intelligence was gathered by the DRI that certain power sector companies were involved in over-invoicing of coal and power generation equipment imported from abroad.

It was detected that Indonesian coal was shipped directly to India but the import invoices were routed by the companies through one or more intermediaries based in countries such as Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong etc., for the artificial inflation of value, which ultimately impacted the power bills of end users through passing on of costs.

The coal import scam was estimated to be at around Rs.29,000 crore. The objective of over-valuation appeared to have been to siphon off money abroad and to avail higher power tariff compensation based on the artificially-inflated cost of the imported coal.

A general alert circular was issued in March 2016 about the modus operandi of over-invoicing of Indonesian coal indulged in by some 40 companies. The circular listed names of 40 companies, out of which 10 entities (including suppliers), were directly related to Adani.

As the next step, the DRI in 2016 obtained a Letters Rogatory (LR), which is sent by a country under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) for the assistance of foreign judicial authorities in probing an offshore entity.

Accordingly, the DRI petitioned the governments of Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong for assistance in gaining access to the overseas bank records of state-owned Indian banks whose accounts were used to facilitate the scam.

Almost 85 percent of the fraudulent over-invoicing done by these companies took place through SBI’s Singapore branch, according to the DRI.

Despite having clinching evidence in hand, the DRI’s probe reached a dead end due to the non-cooperation of banks, citing reasons of international legal agreements with the countries concerned.

“It looks like an ‘invisible outside hand’ is stopping it from happening,” one of the officials was quoted as saying by India Today.

Adani challenged the LR request in one of his group firms, Adani Enterprises Ltd, in the Singapore lower court, which disagreed and ordered the company to turn over its records. Adani appealed against the order in the Singapore High Court and failed there as well.

However, where he succeeded was at the Bombay High Court, where he challenged the issuance of the LR itself, following which the HC quashed all LR proceedings citing technicalities. The Supreme Court stayed the order of the Bombay High Court in 2020.

Earlier, two firms of the Adani Group, allegedly involved in over-valuation of imported power equipment, were served show cause notices on May 15, 2014.

The DRI stated that the goods — power generation and transmission equipment — imported by the firms (APML and APRL) in 2009 and 2010, were shipped directly to India by original equipment manufacturers based in China and South Korea, while the documents were routed through an intermediary entity, Electrogen Infra FZE, UAE (EIF), created in Dubai.

The value of the equipment was inflated by nearly 400 percent ie, Rs.4,000 cr. According to the DRI, EIF was owned and controlled by Vinod Shantilal Adani, the eldest of the Adani brothers.

The DRI alleged that the Adani firms transacted with EIF, a related party, to siphon off Rs.4000 crore abroad.

However, at the first appellate level, the Commissioner disposed of the case in 2017 in favour of Adani. The second appellate CESTAT also decided in favour of Adani.

The appeals are still pending in the Supreme Court.","In fact, the Adani Group’s shady affairs were revealed as early as in 1999, when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence arrested Rajesh Adani, a younger brother of Gautam Adani and currently the managing director of the Adani Group, on charges of evading customs duties.

BJP president JP Nadda led his party’s attack on Rahul, charging him with becoming a “permanent part of the anti-India toolkit” that seeks a weak Government here so as to exploit it for its benefits.

In a statement, Nadda accused Rahul of speaking the language of “anti-India” George Soros, a billionaire financier, and alleged that the Congress and the “so-called Left liberals” have become a part of the “deep state” conspiracy involving foreign forces against the country.

Meanwhile, sources in the BJP said they won’t let Rahul speak in Parliament unless he apologises for his London remarks.

Proceedings on Sansad TV were mostly inaudible. While Parliament sources said it was the result of a “technical glitch”, several Congress leaders alleged that proceedings were “muted” when its MPs raised slogans demanding that Rahul be allowed to speak, and asked if this was democracy.

This was for the fifth consecutive day that the House did not function ever since the second half of the Budget session began on March 13.

As soon as the Lok Sabha assembled for the day, some Congress members trooped to the Well of the House shouting slogans and demanded that Rahul be allowed to speak in the House. They also demanded a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into alleged stock manipulation by the Adani Group, a business conglomerate headed by industrialist Gautam Adani.

The members of the Treasury Benches also raised counter-slogans from their seats, demanding an apology from Gandhi for his remarks.

The turmoil continued for about 20 minutes, with Speaker Om Birla urging the members to allow the House to function smoothly.

“Members, I appeal to you to allow the House to run smoothly. People did not send you here to do this. I will give everyone an opportunity to speak, but the House has to be in order,” he said.

The protesting members ignored his pleas and the speaker adjourned the House for the day. It will meet again on March 20.

In a tweet, the Congress alleged that the proceedings were “muted” when its MPs raised slogans demanding that Gandhi be allowed to speak. Is this democracy, the party asked.

Tagging this tweet, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh posted: “Democracy’ in words but ‘dictatorship’ in action.”

Hitting out at the Government, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in a tweet in Hindi, “Question of the people of the country: What is the relationship between the Prime Minister and Gautam Adani? Why is the Prime Minister not getting the allegations levelled against him (Adani) investigated? BJP Government’s answer -- Mute Modi. Mute Parliament.”

“What is the reason that on hearing the questions related to Adani and the Prime Minister, the entire BJP goes into silent mode,” she asked.

Taking a dig at the Government, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted, “The muting of sound on @sansad_tv is a new technique. You don’t need to switch off individual microphones if you can shut down the transmission of sound to the world!.”

Congress leaders Rahul, Sonia Gandhi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and several other Union Ministers were present in the House.

During his interactions in London, Rahul had alleged that the structures of Indian democracy are under attack and there is a “full-scale assault” on the country’s institutions. The remarks triggered a political slugfest, with the BJP accusing Gandhi of maligning India on foreign soil and seeking foreign interventions, and the Congress hitting back at the ruling party by citing previous instances of Prime Minister Narendra Modi raising internal politics abroad.

BJP president Nadda accused the former Congress chief of joining hands with foreign conspirators against India to encircle the country economically and strategically. Never before in independent India any leader has done what Rahul has done on foreign soil, he said. “This is a most serious matter,” Nadda said, adding that what the Congress leader has done has hurt every patriotic MP as well as the people of the country.

The BJP president said anti-India forces have always had problems with a strong India, its robust democracy and decisive government. By criticising the state of democracy in India and seeking the intervention of the United States and Europe on foreign soil, Rahul has attacked the country’s sovereignty, he added.

“Rejected repeatedly by people, Rahul Gandhi has become a permanent part of the anti-India toolkit,” Nadda said.

He accused the former Congress chief of insulting India, its Parliament, its democratically-elected Government and people in Britain, a country that ruled over India for long. What Rahul has done amounts to strengthening those working against India, the BJP president said.

The Congress has dismissed the BJP’s accusations and asserted that Rahul will not apologise. He has sought permission to speak in Parliament to respond to the criticism levelled against him by the ruling party members in both houses. Parliamentary proceedings during the second half of the Budget Session have so far been a washout over the row.","Meanwhile, sources in the BJP said they won’t let Rahul speak in Parliament unless he apologises for his London remarks.

Asserting that they had done their own due diligence in order to allay investor concerns, Jain said he didn’t feel that Adani is a very risky bet.

“We look at where these businesses are going to be in five years. We look at PEs 4-5 years down the line,” Jain said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Our job is to worry about everything. Question is what is the risk-reward value. We do our own due diligence. We did speak to some former regulators as part of our due diligence, he said, adding that the bankers they talked never mentioned ""fraud"".

Jain noted that the execution in Adani’s infrastructure projects were quite big, and importantly, their maintenance capex was very low. He underlined that they were looking at how these assets would do in five years.

He also said that they had met some of the management of Adani group through brokerage firm Jefferies.

""I believe they (Adani group) need to keep growing; it will be a mistake to stop growing. I would say, 'don’t change anything to please the market',"" Jain said.

Stating that GQG Partners have historically owned very high multiple stocks, he said that many of the allegations made in the Hindenburg report are not substantive.

“Lot of the allegations being made are totally fluff,” he said. “The Hindenburg report, if you go through the allegations, verify one by one, — the problem is that people are not doing that — the vast majority are not substantive,” Rajiv Jain said.

On 16 March, it informed India’s stock market that the latter was a member of the promoter group. “We would like to submit that Mr Gautam Adani and Mr Rajesh Adani are individual promoters of various listed entities within the Adani Group and Mr Vinod Adani is an immediate relative of the individual promoters,"" its filing said. “Accordingly, as per the applicable Indian regulations, Mr Vinod Adani is part of the ‘promoter group’ of various listed entities within the Adani Group. This fact has been submitted to Indian regulatory authorities from time to time, in various disclosures."" Its rebuttal of Hindenburg’s charges, in contrast, had deflected a set of queries by saying, “Vinod Adani does not hold any managerial position in any Adani listed entities or their subsidiaries and has no role in their day to day affairs."" This, however, did not square up with one big fact: the elder brother’s control of Endeavour Trade and Investment Ltd, which acquired ACC and Ambuja Cements for about $10.5 billion from Holcim last year to mark yet another market entry by the infra-focused group. As this fraternal link had duly been disclosed, even the documentation record left Adani’s stance hollow.

Three questions assume urgency. First, did Adani violate India’s free-float norms? On paper, the group’s listed companies barely met the minimum equity of 25% that should be available for public trading. If a chunk of their float portion is found to be under Vinod Adani’s effective control via a web of offshore entities, as alleged by Hindenburg, then it would imply a failure of compliance. An episode of share-price jitters in 2021 over this suspicion prompted the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), our market regulator, to explore the need for a free-float definition that would exclude shares held by institutions as well (and not just promoters). The logic of keeping strategic interests out of the count did not get far. But it matters. After all, only a sliver of a firm’s equity pie being openly traded exposes it to easy manipulation. That leads us to the second question. Did Adani use an overseas network to manipulate its share prices? This is for a Sebi probe to answer. But we need not delve into forensic trails to identify a few tell-tale signs. Even for a blistering pace of growth, Adani scrips had zoomed off the charts in terms of their price-earning ratios, which had reached multiple hundreds in a bazaar where a ratio above 30 needs a jackpot on its way to justify such a high price. Inflated valuations do have a motive. Equity can be pledged for loans, as Adani did. Although the group has lowered its debt slightly after a share sale to Rajiv Jain’s US-based fund GQG Partners—steadying its market capitalization that had more than halved since Republic Day—what enabled its over-leverage has kept eyebrows raised.

The final question is of India’s infrastructure mega-thrust involving the private sector that could deliver what the country needs, but also has some aspects that risk creating conditions for crony capitalism. So, did Adani’s apparent status as a ‘national champion’ of sorts attract a regulatory look-away? While Adani’s sharp rise and perceived proximity to the current regime are embroiled now in a political row, the episode has put the country’s institutional framework to a test. For the sake of our bet on market democracy, we need clear answers.","In a U-turn that amplified questions raised by the Hindenburg report of 24 January, the Adani Group has quit distancing itself from its chairman Gautam Adani’s elder brother Vinod Adani.

The Congress has alleged that there is causation, not merely correlation between the resumption of the hearings in Surat against Rahul Gandhi, after a curious suspension with the complainant seeking to delay proceedings. It is the defendant who usually does that.

The case was filed on April 16, 2019, and Rahul Gandhi appeared in the court of the then CJM, Surat, A.N. Dave on June 24, 2021, to record his statement in person. The case was filed by a Gujarat state cabinet minister and three-times MLA from Surat West, in March 2022, when the complainant’s request for Rahul Gandhi to be summoned again was rejected by the CJM who insisted arguments commence immediately, the complainant rushed to the high court and sought a stay on the trial’s proceedings. This was granted on March 7, 2022.

After a break of 11 months, the complainant went back to the high court on February 16, 2023, seeking vacation of the stay, pleading that “sufficient evidence has come on record of the trial court and the pendency of the present matter delays the trial”. Though no new evidence had come on record since the stay and the “pendency of the matter” was entirely at his own instance, the complainant was granted the relief he sought.

Complainant Purnesh Modi’s decision to restart a trial he had himself put on hold for a year came barely a week after Rahul Gandhi had launched a sharp attack on Narendra Modi in parliament over his links to controversial businessman Gautam Adani.

The Lok Sabha speech by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on February 7 seems to have set other things in motion too, far away from Surat, in parliament. Portions of Gandhi’s speech that hit out at the prime minister for allegedly facilitating the unencumbered growth of Adani Group were expunged from the parliamentary records at the behest of speaker Om Birla on February 8. 18 portions were knocked out.

It is hard to prove that there is a direct Adani connection to the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Lok Sabha, but the sequence of events raises enough questions about such a possibility. The government would be hard-pressed to deny such a linkage with any authority, considering how PM Modi has avoided a response to any mention of Adani.","The case was filed on April 16, 2019, and Rahul Gandhi appeared in the court of the then CJM, Surat, A.N.

Paris, March 23, 2023 - Contrary to Le Monde French newspaper’s assertion that our Company refused to respond to so-called accusations, we are publishing the exhaustive answers we gave to Le Monde in the context of the preparation of its article on the Adani Group.

1) Indian stock market regulations require that publicly listed companies have a float of at least 25%. According to Hindenburg Research, this rule was clearly not complied with in the case of Adani Gas, since TotalEnergies was only able to acquire 559 shares of Adani Gas when it wanted to acquire 277 million shares in 2019 via a public offer. This suggests that, at the time, there was not a float and that the capital was actually controlled by disguised Adani subsidiaries registered in Mauritius. Didn't you find it odd that the offer was not taken up? Why didn't you alert the stock market authorities?



The acquisition of a 37.4% interest in Adani Gas Limited (now Adani Total Gas Limited) was carried out in compliance with Indian stock market rules, notably as concerns price, through a primary and secondary offer. Following discussions with Adani, a public offer to buy shares was launched at a price similar to the one agreed upon with Adani, which was 10% below the market price. It is therefore not surprising that there was not much take up for the public offer. In addition, it should be noted that from one public offer to buy part of the shares of a company to another, free-float shareholders frequently hold onto their shares, thinking that they will rise in value as a result of the public offer and the arrival of a new heavyweight industrial investor.

2) In late 2022, the stock price of Adani Total Gas had risen twenty-fold since TotalEnergies' became a shareholder. This rise was exceptional, even abnormal, given the sector's performance over the same period, particularly for utilities. How do you explain this increase? Didn't you ever suspect the price was being manipulated?



TotalEnergies invested in Adani Gas to develop our LNG sales in India, not to generate stock market gains. The share price trend was therefore never a consideration for TotalEnergies, and it had no impact on the strategy or financial performance of Adani Gas, since the company did not issue any new shares. That said, it should be noted, first, that the valuation of Indian energy companies follows its own logic, based on their growth potential and the limited investment opportunities in the Indian energy sector. It is therefore difficult to compare with the global utilities sector. Second, the Indian stock market authorities did not report any irregularities that could have alerted us.



3) Hindenburg Research accuses you of closing your eyes to these irregularities, or worse, being complicit. What do you say to them?

Hindenburg Research has not made any accusations against TotalEnergies, and we would appreciate your telling us what allows you to affirm that they have. As we indicated in our response to your first question, the acquisition of our 37.4% interest in Adani Gas Limited was carried out in compliance with Indian stock market regulations. TotalEnergies has not bought or sold Adani Total Gas Limited shares since this acquisition.

4) Why did you choose to invest in Adani when, in 2019 – the year you decided to invest in Adani Gas –, many specialists, quoted in numerous news articles, warned about the Group's virtual bankruptcy and opaque financing in tax havens?

TotalEnergies did not invest in the Adani group but rather in three specific subsidiaries, including publicly-listed Adani Gas and Adani Green, that corresponded to TotalEnergies' strategy to develop in gas and renewables. These two energies are experiencing strong growth in India as a result of the country's desire to diversify its energy mix as part of its energy transition and policy to limit CO2 emissions. These two companies are backed by tangible, solid assets that generate stable, growing cash flow. They are able to meet their financial commitments. In addition, they make no use of tax havens in conducting their business.

Lastly, it should be noted that TotalEnergies’ investments in Adani’s entities were undertaken in full compliance with applicable – namely Indian – laws, and with TotalEnergies’ own internal governance processes. The due diligence, which were carried out to TotalEnergies’ satisfaction, were consistent with best practices, and all relevant material in the public domain was reviewed, including the detailed disclosures to regulators required under applicable laws.



5) Were you pressured in any way politically to invest in the Adani group rather than in another Indian company? Did you negotiate with anyone else before choosing Adani?

No, TotalEnergies was not pressured in any way. In 2017-2018, TotalEnergies reviewed several possible public and private partnerships in India, in light of the huge potential of the country's energy market. In 2018, TotalEnergies decided to develop an industrial partnership with the Adani group given Adani’s skills, desire to grow in gas and renewables, and interest in partnering with an international company like ours.

6) Are the Adani group's operations, notably in Australia, where a coal mine threatens the Great Barrier Reef, compatible with TotalEnergies' environmental commitments?

TotalEnergies has no partnerships with Adani in coal, an energy from which TotalEnergies definitively exited in 2015. TotalEnergies' partnership with Adani is limited to gas and renewables in India. This partnership has made it possible to accelerate investments in renewables and gas distribution in India, a country still heavily dependent on coal. It therefore fits in perfectly with our strategy of supporting our partners in their energy transition and in decarbonizing their energy mix.

7) How much value have your interests in the Adani group lost since Hindenburg Research released its report?

TotalEnergies' investment in our interests stood at $3.1 billion at 31 December 2022, equivalent to 2.4% of the Company's capital employed. Because these companies are accounted for by the equity method, TotalEnergies did not revalue its interests in publicly-listed ATGL and AGEL in its accounts in connection with the increase in the share price. That said, at the current price, these interests would be worth $5.1 billion, which is still a significant capital gain.

8) Does your 5.3 GW of installed renewable capacity in India at end-2022 correspond to 20% of Adani Green's gross capacity (Adani Green is a subsidiary of Adani in which TotalEnergies holds a 20% interest)?

TotalEnergies' renewable capacity in India also includes projects that Total Eren (in which TotalEnergies holds a 30% interest) is developing in partnership with EDF.

9) At end-2022, India accounted for 1 GW of TotalEnergies' gross renewable capacity under construction. Is all this capacity linked to the Adani group? If so, is any of it compromised by the Adani group's current difficulties?

Same as above. In addition, Adani Green's renewable projects in production and under development in India are very solid; they are producing energy and generating revenue. There is therefore no reason to halt assets in production or projects under construction. Our investment in India is industrial, not financial.



10) At end-2022, India accounted for 4.5 GW of TotalEnergies' gross renewable capacity under development. Is all this capacity linked to the Adani group? If so, is any of it compromised by the Adani group's current difficulties?

TotalEnergies' renewable capacity in India also includes projects that Total Eren (in which TotalEnergies holds a 30% interest) is developing in partnership with EDF. It is too early to say if the pace of Adani Green's growth needs to be revised.

11) Why did you suspend your participation in the Adani project related to hydrogen? Have you evaluated the cost of a possible cancellation? What conditions have you set for making a decision on whether or not to withdraw from the project?

TotalEnergies announced that it wanted to acquire a 25% interest in Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL) in June 2022. The agreement was not yet finalized. On February 8, 2023, TotalEnergies announced that it was pausing the transaction until an independent review ordered by the Adani group and an investigation by the Indian government released their findings. This was a logical decision of prudence. At this stage, TotalEnergies had recorded only very limited study-related expenses for this project.

12) For renewable energies, why do you talk about ""gross capacity"" rather than net? What criteria do you use to define a project as ""in development' or ""under construction""?

Generally speaking, we talk about gross capacity and net production, as is common practice in the energy industry.

That said, we also disclose the Company's net renewable portfolio all countries combined, which comes to 45.5 GW (see below). In Adani Green's case, we only account for 20% of the company's gross capacity. So gross is equal to net.

TotalEnergies assigns its renewable projects to three categories, depending on their maturity:

Installed capacity is the most advanced stage. These projects have been commissioned and are operational.

Capacity under construction is the intermediate stage. These projects are under construction but don't yet produce electricity.

Capacity under development refers to projects that have been identified and are part of the TotalEnergies portfolio, but that are not yet under construction. There may still be studies to complete or permits to be obtained.

13) Do the recent revelations about the Adani group impact your strategy in India in gas (notably LNG) and retailing (service stations)?

India has huge needs for reliable, affordable, low carbon energy. It remains a market full of opportunities. In particular, India is a promising market for LNG, and the Dhamra terminal will be commissioned in the coming months. We do not have any ambition in the service station sector in India.","TotalEnergies invested in Adani Gas to develop our LNG sales in India, not to generate stock market gains.
That said, it should be noted, first, that the valuation of Indian energy companies follows its own logic, based on their growth potential and the limited investment opportunities in the Indian energy sector.
TotalEnergies did not invest in the Adani group but rather in three specific subsidiaries, including publicly-listed Adani Gas and Adani Green, that corresponded to TotalEnergies' strategy to develop in gas and renewables.

NEW DELHI, March 22 (Reuters) - India's Adani Group will focus on expanding its aviation business and plans to bid for more government-run airports when they come up for privatisation, Adani Airports' chief executive said on Wednesday.

The South Asian nation is the world's fastest-growing aviation market, with demand for air travel outstripping the supply of planes. Some major airports are already reaching full capacity even as airlines continue to order more planes.

Air India last month placed a record order for 470 jets and domestic rival IndiGo is in talks for a new order of more than 500 planes, Reuters reported this month, even as it waits to take delivery of the same number from an older order.

""Our ambition is to do more airports in India,"" Adani Airports CEO Arun Bansal said, adding that the government's airport privatisation policy is publicly known, ""and we intend to bid for that"".

Adani already owns and operates seven airports, including six that it won as part of the government's first privatisation drive, and a new airport it is building in Navi Mumbai on the outskirts of India's financial capital.

The government has plans to privatise 25 more airports under a public-private partnership until 2025 and Bansal said the group would look at bidding ""if the conditions are right"".

The expansion plans come as billionaire Gautam Adani's group tries to rebuild investor confidence after U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens - charges the company has denied.

Hindenburg's Jan. 24 report eroded more than $100 billion in the value of the company's shares.

Asked if the group's challenges would affect airport expansion or investment plans, Bansal brushed aside concerns, saying it is pushing ahead and all its projects are on track.

""Our strategy is simple - to create scale,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of the CAPA India conference.

The Hindenburg report claimed its research involved dozens of interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts, and an extensive review of regulatory and litigation records, among others.

The report also claimed Block “wildly overstated” genuine user counts and “understated” customer acquisition costs for years.

“Former employees evidenced that many users have dozens, or even hundreds of accounts associated with them, vastly inflating user metrics,” the report claimed.

“Most analysts are excited about the post-pandemic surge of Block’s Cash App platform, with expectations that its 51 million monthly transacting active users and low customer acquisition costs will drive high margin growth and serve as a future platform to offer new products.”

Further, Block, according to the report, obfuscated how many unique individuals use Cash App, reporting misleading metrics on “transacting actives” which include duplicate accounts by the same user. Former employees, it claimed, estimated that 40-75 per cent of accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or duplicates.

Block shares slumped sharply after the allegations were levelled against it.

Block reportedly said the Hindenburg report was “factually inaccurate and misleading” and threatened to “explore legal action” against the short seller.

The latest report by the US-based short seller firm comes about two months after it raised concerns about shares of Adani group companies having a possibility of declining from their current levels, owing to high valuations, and alleged stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Following the report, the Adani group companies’ shares declined sharply, though with varying degrees, and lost value of over USD 100 billion. The continued sell-offs in the group’s stocks led its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises Limited, to cancel a fully subscribed Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offer.

Adani Group responded by saying that the report by Hindenburg Research was not an attack on any specific company but a “calculated attack” on India, its growth story, and ambitions.

Also, in its response to the Hindenburg Research, the Adani Group has attacked Hindenburg as “an unethical short seller”. It added the report was “nothing but a lie”. Adani Group, in its 413-page report, also responded to all 88 questions raised by Hindenburg in detail.

The short-seller’s announcement detailed numerous allegations against Block, led by Jack Dorsey, the cofounder and former CEO of Twitter. Among other claims, the short-seller alleges that Block, formerly known as Square, has misled investors on key metrics, including its user counts and how much it spends targeting new customers, and has opened up Cash App to criminals, claiming the digital wallet is used for sex trafficking and the trafficking of minors.

“The ‘magic’ behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics,” Hindenberg wrote.

Hindenburg says its decision to short Block, which follows a two-year-long investigation, is based on interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts; a review of regulatory and litigation documents; and a series of public records requests.

Block’s share price was down approximately 20% early Thursday, dropping from over $72.94 the day before to $59.80 when markets opened. It recovered a bit, to $63.50, around midday.

The sudden drop in the share price of the payments giant, which has made a series of investments in Bitcoin and crypto, comes shortly after it announced strong growth in revenue and gross profit from Cash App and Square in its most recent quarterly earnings report.

Most of Hindenburg’s allegations centered on Cash App, Block’s flagship mobile payments product released in 2013. The app posted 51 million active users last year, a 16% increase from 2021, while gross profits from the app during the fourth quarter also grew to $848 million, a 64% increase from the same period a year earlier. Like other money-transfer apps, including PayPal’s Venmo, use of Cash App surged during the pandemic, and was used to facilitate COVID-relief payments.

“We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today,” Block wrote in a statement. “We will not be distracted by typical short seller tactics.”

Block released its annual corporate responsibility report on Wednesday, one day before Hindenburg revealed its short position. In the report, Dorsey wrote: “Throughout 2022 we continued to advance our purpose of economic empowerment” through its products, including Cash App. The report also stated that the company “believes in robust oversight over compliance with laws and regulations.”

The giant killer

Hindenburg has made a name for itself betting against unprofitable firms, shell companies, and crypto agencies, but the New York-based short-selling firm stepped up its game earlier this year when it launched an attack on Adani Group, India’s biggest conglomerate.

In January, Hindenburg released a report targeting Adani, the company founded by Gautam Adani with massive holdings in Indian ports, commodities trading, and energy plants. Hindenburg’s report accused Adani of stock manipulation, fraud, and poor leadership, sparking a stock rout that wiped out over $100 billion in Adani’s market value over 10 days.

Adani himself has routinely denied Hindenburg’s accusations, and U.S. investment firms have begun to tentatively bet on his companies again after the Indian conglomerate managed to repay millions in outstanding loans to restore investor confidence in the months since Hindenburg’s short.

Even before bringing down Adani, Hindenburg had made a name for itself as a market mover with several in-depth investigative reports accompanying announcements that it’s shorting a company’s stock.

In 2020, the investment group published a report on Nikola Corporation, an electric vehicle manufacturer, accusing it of defrauding investors and company founder Trevor Milton of making false statements to partner with larger automakers when the company went public. In 2022, Milton was found guilty for deceiving investors with exaggerated claims about his company’s progress in developing zero-emission trucks.

In 2021, after Hindenburg published another report about DraftKings that said it had partnered with a Bulgarian technology company allegedly involved in money laundering, black-market gaming, and organized crime. The Securities and Exchange Commission later subpoenaed the sports-betting operation.

Cash App allegations

In its latest report, Hindenburg wrote that former Block employees said that between 40% and 75% of accounts they reviewed on Cash App were fake, involved in fraud, or one of multiple accounts tied to a single person.

In addition, the short-seller said a series of Department of Justice complaints said Cash App was used in sex-trafficking cases. And it alleged the digital wallet was also used to facilitate fraud related to U.S. government COVID-relief stimulus checks.

To illustrate its point of how Cash App is commonly used for criminal activities, Hindenburg said it had created two clearly fake accounts under the names “Donald Trump” and “Elon Musk,” both of which were deemed legitimate by Cash App. The report also pointed out how the app has entered the cultural zeitgeist with a wave of mentions in popular rap and hip-hop songs, although in many instances artists described using it to “scam, traffic drugs, or even pay for murder,” according to the report. Hindenburg even compiled a video of instances where Cash App was described as being used for criminal purposes in music videos.

Although unwanted attention from Hindenburg has caused companies to collapse and founders to face criminal trials in the past, a damning report from the short-seller is not necessarily a death sentence. Adani Group’s market value recently climbed back to $110 billion from a low of $82 billion earlier this year, The Economist reported last week, after repaying many of its loans and restoring some investor confidence.

(SQ) founded by Jack Dorsey. Hindenburg's report claimed that Block has allowed fraudulent accounts to proliferate on cash applications, generating illegitimate revenue and exaggerating user metrics.

The short seller's report said, ""the “magic"" behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.""

Hindenburg released this report after carrying two years of investigation on Block. The short seller's research includes dozens of interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts, extensive review of regulatory and litigation records, and FOIA and public records requests.

It concluded that Block has systematically taken advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping.

Block which was formerly known as Square Inc, is a $44 billion market cap company. Hindunberg stated that the company claims to have developed a “frictionless"" and “magical"" financial technology with a mission to empower the “unbanked"" and the “underbanked"".

Block offers payment and mobile banking services for merchants and consumers.

The Nathan Anderson-backed research firm shed great limelight on Block's CASH App platform. According to them, Block's climb to stardom comes due adoption of the Cash App.

But Hindenburg claimed that former employees estimated that 40%-75% of accounts on Cash App that they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.

Hindenburg argued that the core of the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally very “underbanked"" segment of the population: criminals. The company’s “Wild West"" approach to compliance made it easy for bad actors to mass-create accounts for identity fraud and other scams, then extract stolen funds quickly.

The case of Block is quite spooky, especially its Cash App which has sparked many hip-hop songs.

Hindenburg's report said, even when users were caught engaging in fraud or other prohibited activity, Block blacklisted the account without banning the user.

A former customer service rep shared screenshots with Hindenburg showing how blacklisted accounts were regularly associated with dozens or hundreds of other active accounts suspected of fraud. This phenomenon of allowing blacklisted users was so common that rappers bragged about it in hip-hop songs.

Hindenburg said, CEO Jack Dorsey has publicly touted how Cash App is mentioned in hundreds of hip-hop songs as evidence of its mainstream appeal. A review of those songs shows that the artists are not generally rapping about Cash App’s smooth user interface—many describe using it to scam, traffic drugs or even pay for murder.

“I paid them hitters through Cash App"" A quote Hindenburg cited while revealing that Block paid to promote a video for a song called “Cash App"" which described paying contract killers through the app. The song’s artist was later arrested for attempted murder.

Also, Cash App was cited by far as the top app used in reported U.S. sex trafficking, according to a leading non-profit organization. Multiple Department of Justice complaints outline how Cash App has been used to facilitate sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of minors.

Hence, Hindenburg said, ""Block can and should clarify to investors an estimate on how many unique people actually use Cash App.""

Beyond facilitating payments for criminal activity, Hindenburg stated that the platform has been overrun with scam accounts and fake users, according to numerous interviews with former employees. Some of the fake accounts on the app have usernames of the biggest individuals such as ""Donald Trump"" and ""Elon Musk"". Even ""Jack Dorsey"" is the user name of multiple fake accounts.

Hindenburg highlighted a bull case for Block. By end of 2019, Block's merchant services accounted for $1.39 billion in gross profit, compared to the consumer-facing Cash App, which accounted for only $457.6 million of gross profit.

But these figures changed drastically during the pandemic. Hindenburg said many merchant businesses locked down and individuals activated millions of Cash App accounts to receive government stimulus and unemployment payments.

By end of 2020, Cash App reported 36 million monthly activities, which has since grown to 51 million. By 2020-end, Cash App's gross profit reached $1.2 billion, a 170% growth rate from the prior year, compared with merchant services gross profit of $1.5 billion, an 8% growth rate from the prior year

Further, Hindenburg reported that even as billions of fraudulent transactions were being processing through Cash App’s platform, Block insiders were hitting the exit to the tune of more than $1 billion in insider stock sales between March 2020, the beginning of the pandemic and December 31, 2021.","Also, Cash App was cited by far as the top app used in reported U.S. sex trafficking, according to a leading non-profit organization.

The Congress has alleged that there is causation, not merely correlation between the resumption of the hearings in Surat against Rahul Gandhi, after a curious suspension with the complainant seeking to delay proceedings. It is the defendant who usually does that.

The case was filed on April 16, 2019, and Rahul Gandhi appeared in the court of the then CJM, Surat, A.N. Dave on June 24, 2021, to record his statement in person. The case was filed by a Gujarat state cabinet minister and three-times MLA from Surat West, in March 2022, when the complainant’s request for Rahul Gandhi to be summoned again was rejected by the CJM who insisted arguments commence immediately, the complainant rushed to the high court and sought a stay on the trial’s proceedings. This was granted on March 7, 2022.

After a break of 11 months, the complainant went back to the high court on February 16, 2023, seeking vacation of the stay, pleading that “sufficient evidence has come on record of the trial court and the pendency of the present matter delays the trial”. Though no new evidence had come on record since the stay and the “pendency of the matter” was entirely at his own instance, the complainant was granted the relief he sought.

Complainant Purnesh Modi’s decision to restart a trial he had himself put on hold for a year came barely a week after Rahul Gandhi had launched a sharp attack on Narendra Modi in parliament over his links to controversial businessman Gautam Adani.

The Lok Sabha speech by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on February 7 seems to have set other things in motion too, far away from Surat, in parliament. Portions of Gandhi’s speech that hit out at the prime minister for allegedly facilitating the unencumbered growth of Adani Group were expunged from the parliamentary records at the behest of speaker Om Birla on February 8. 18 portions were knocked out.

It is hard to prove that there is a direct Adani connection to the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Lok Sabha, but the sequence of events raises enough questions about such a possibility. The government would be hard-pressed to deny such a linkage with any authority, considering how PM Modi has avoided a response to any mention of Adani.","The case was filed on April 16, 2019, and Rahul Gandhi appeared in the court of the then CJM, Surat, A.N.

Paris, March 23, 2023 - Contrary to Le Monde French newspaper’s assertion that our Company refused to respond to so-called accusations, we are publishing the exhaustive answers we gave to Le Monde in the context of the preparation of its article on the Adani Group.

1) Indian stock market regulations require that publicly listed companies have a float of at least 25%. According to Hindenburg Research, this rule was clearly not complied with in the case of Adani Gas, since TotalEnergies was only able to acquire 559 shares of Adani Gas when it wanted to acquire 277 million shares in 2019 via a public offer. This suggests that, at the time, there was not a float and that the capital was actually controlled by disguised Adani subsidiaries registered in Mauritius. Didn't you find it odd that the offer was not taken up? Why didn't you alert the stock market authorities?



The acquisition of a 37.4% interest in Adani Gas Limited (now Adani Total Gas Limited) was carried out in compliance with Indian stock market rules, notably as concerns price, through a primary and secondary offer. Following discussions with Adani, a public offer to buy shares was launched at a price similar to the one agreed upon with Adani, which was 10% below the market price. It is therefore not surprising that there was not much take up for the public offer. In addition, it should be noted that from one public offer to buy part of the shares of a company to another, free-float shareholders frequently hold onto their shares, thinking that they will rise in value as a result of the public offer and the arrival of a new heavyweight industrial investor.

2) In late 2022, the stock price of Adani Total Gas had risen twenty-fold since TotalEnergies' became a shareholder. This rise was exceptional, even abnormal, given the sector's performance over the same period, particularly for utilities. How do you explain this increase? Didn't you ever suspect the price was being manipulated?



TotalEnergies invested in Adani Gas to develop our LNG sales in India, not to generate stock market gains. The share price trend was therefore never a consideration for TotalEnergies, and it had no impact on the strategy or financial performance of Adani Gas, since the company did not issue any new shares. That said, it should be noted, first, that the valuation of Indian energy companies follows its own logic, based on their growth potential and the limited investment opportunities in the Indian energy sector. It is therefore difficult to compare with the global utilities sector. Second, the Indian stock market authorities did not report any irregularities that could have alerted us.



3) Hindenburg Research accuses you of closing your eyes to these irregularities, or worse, being complicit. What do you say to them?

Hindenburg Research has not made any accusations against TotalEnergies, and we would appreciate your telling us what allows you to affirm that they have. As we indicated in our response to your first question, the acquisition of our 37.4% interest in Adani Gas Limited was carried out in compliance with Indian stock market regulations. TotalEnergies has not bought or sold Adani Total Gas Limited shares since this acquisition.

4) Why did you choose to invest in Adani when, in 2019 – the year you decided to invest in Adani Gas –, many specialists, quoted in numerous news articles, warned about the Group's virtual bankruptcy and opaque financing in tax havens?

TotalEnergies did not invest in the Adani group but rather in three specific subsidiaries, including publicly-listed Adani Gas and Adani Green, that corresponded to TotalEnergies' strategy to develop in gas and renewables. These two energies are experiencing strong growth in India as a result of the country's desire to diversify its energy mix as part of its energy transition and policy to limit CO2 emissions. These two companies are backed by tangible, solid assets that generate stable, growing cash flow. They are able to meet their financial commitments. In addition, they make no use of tax havens in conducting their business.

Lastly, it should be noted that TotalEnergies’ investments in Adani’s entities were undertaken in full compliance with applicable – namely Indian – laws, and with TotalEnergies’ own internal governance processes. The due diligence, which were carried out to TotalEnergies’ satisfaction, were consistent with best practices, and all relevant material in the public domain was reviewed, including the detailed disclosures to regulators required under applicable laws.



5) Were you pressured in any way politically to invest in the Adani group rather than in another Indian company? Did you negotiate with anyone else before choosing Adani?

No, TotalEnergies was not pressured in any way. In 2017-2018, TotalEnergies reviewed several possible public and private partnerships in India, in light of the huge potential of the country's energy market. In 2018, TotalEnergies decided to develop an industrial partnership with the Adani group given Adani’s skills, desire to grow in gas and renewables, and interest in partnering with an international company like ours.

6) Are the Adani group's operations, notably in Australia, where a coal mine threatens the Great Barrier Reef, compatible with TotalEnergies' environmental commitments?

TotalEnergies has no partnerships with Adani in coal, an energy from which TotalEnergies definitively exited in 2015. TotalEnergies' partnership with Adani is limited to gas and renewables in India. This partnership has made it possible to accelerate investments in renewables and gas distribution in India, a country still heavily dependent on coal. It therefore fits in perfectly with our strategy of supporting our partners in their energy transition and in decarbonizing their energy mix.

7) How much value have your interests in the Adani group lost since Hindenburg Research released its report?

TotalEnergies' investment in our interests stood at $3.1 billion at 31 December 2022, equivalent to 2.4% of the Company's capital employed. Because these companies are accounted for by the equity method, TotalEnergies did not revalue its interests in publicly-listed ATGL and AGEL in its accounts in connection with the increase in the share price. That said, at the current price, these interests would be worth $5.1 billion, which is still a significant capital gain.

8) Does your 5.3 GW of installed renewable capacity in India at end-2022 correspond to 20% of Adani Green's gross capacity (Adani Green is a subsidiary of Adani in which TotalEnergies holds a 20% interest)?

TotalEnergies' renewable capacity in India also includes projects that Total Eren (in which TotalEnergies holds a 30% interest) is developing in partnership with EDF.

9) At end-2022, India accounted for 1 GW of TotalEnergies' gross renewable capacity under construction. Is all this capacity linked to the Adani group? If so, is any of it compromised by the Adani group's current difficulties?

Same as above. In addition, Adani Green's renewable projects in production and under development in India are very solid; they are producing energy and generating revenue. There is therefore no reason to halt assets in production or projects under construction. Our investment in India is industrial, not financial.



10) At end-2022, India accounted for 4.5 GW of TotalEnergies' gross renewable capacity under development. Is all this capacity linked to the Adani group? If so, is any of it compromised by the Adani group's current difficulties?

TotalEnergies' renewable capacity in India also includes projects that Total Eren (in which TotalEnergies holds a 30% interest) is developing in partnership with EDF. It is too early to say if the pace of Adani Green's growth needs to be revised.

11) Why did you suspend your participation in the Adani project related to hydrogen? Have you evaluated the cost of a possible cancellation? What conditions have you set for making a decision on whether or not to withdraw from the project?

TotalEnergies announced that it wanted to acquire a 25% interest in Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL) in June 2022. The agreement was not yet finalized. On February 8, 2023, TotalEnergies announced that it was pausing the transaction until an independent review ordered by the Adani group and an investigation by the Indian government released their findings. This was a logical decision of prudence. At this stage, TotalEnergies had recorded only very limited study-related expenses for this project.

12) For renewable energies, why do you talk about ""gross capacity"" rather than net? What criteria do you use to define a project as ""in development' or ""under construction""?

Generally speaking, we talk about gross capacity and net production, as is common practice in the energy industry.

That said, we also disclose the Company's net renewable portfolio all countries combined, which comes to 45.5 GW (see below). In Adani Green's case, we only account for 20% of the company's gross capacity. So gross is equal to net.

TotalEnergies assigns its renewable projects to three categories, depending on their maturity:

Installed capacity is the most advanced stage. These projects have been commissioned and are operational.

Capacity under construction is the intermediate stage. These projects are under construction but don't yet produce electricity.

Capacity under development refers to projects that have been identified and are part of the TotalEnergies portfolio, but that are not yet under construction. There may still be studies to complete or permits to be obtained.

13) Do the recent revelations about the Adani group impact your strategy in India in gas (notably LNG) and retailing (service stations)?

India has huge needs for reliable, affordable, low carbon energy. It remains a market full of opportunities. In particular, India is a promising market for LNG, and the Dhamra terminal will be commissioned in the coming months. We do not have any ambition in the service station sector in India.","TotalEnergies invested in Adani Gas to develop our LNG sales in India, not to generate stock market gains.
That said, it should be noted, first, that the valuation of Indian energy companies follows its own logic, based on their growth potential and the limited investment opportunities in the Indian energy sector.
TotalEnergies did not invest in the Adani group but rather in three specific subsidiaries, including publicly-listed Adani Gas and Adani Green, that corresponded to TotalEnergies' strategy to develop in gas and renewables.

NEW DELHI, March 22 (Reuters) - India's Adani Group will focus on expanding its aviation business and plans to bid for more government-run airports when they come up for privatisation, Adani Airports' chief executive said on Wednesday.

The South Asian nation is the world's fastest-growing aviation market, with demand for air travel outstripping the supply of planes. Some major airports are already reaching full capacity even as airlines continue to order more planes.

Air India last month placed a record order for 470 jets and domestic rival IndiGo is in talks for a new order of more than 500 planes, Reuters reported this month, even as it waits to take delivery of the same number from an older order.

""Our ambition is to do more airports in India,"" Adani Airports CEO Arun Bansal said, adding that the government's airport privatisation policy is publicly known, ""and we intend to bid for that"".

Adani already owns and operates seven airports, including six that it won as part of the government's first privatisation drive, and a new airport it is building in Navi Mumbai on the outskirts of India's financial capital.

The government has plans to privatise 25 more airports under a public-private partnership until 2025 and Bansal said the group would look at bidding ""if the conditions are right"".

The expansion plans come as billionaire Gautam Adani's group tries to rebuild investor confidence after U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens - charges the company has denied.

Hindenburg's Jan. 24 report eroded more than $100 billion in the value of the company's shares.

Asked if the group's challenges would affect airport expansion or investment plans, Bansal brushed aside concerns, saying it is pushing ahead and all its projects are on track.

""Our strategy is simple - to create scale,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of the CAPA India conference.

Jack Dorsey, the former head of Twitter, is co-founder and CEO of Block.

“The magic behind $SQ (Block) has not been innovation, but its willingness to mislead investors, facilitate fraud, avoid regulation and dress up predatory products as revolutionary tech,” Hindenburg alleged in the report, published on Thursday.

The Hindenburg report claimed its research involved dozens of interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts, and an extensive review of regulatory and litigation records, among others.

The report also claimed Block “wildly overstated” genuine user counts and “understated” customer acquisition costs for years.

“Former employees evidenced that many users have dozens, or even hundreds of accounts associated with them, vastly inflating user metrics,” the report claimed.

“Most analysts are excited about the post-pandemic surge of Block’s Cash App platform, with expectations that its 51 million monthly transacting active users and low customer acquisition costs will drive high margin growth and serve as a future platform to offer new products.”

Further, Block, according to the report, obfuscated how many unique individuals use Cash App, reporting misleading metrics on “transacting actives” which include duplicate accounts by the same user. Former employees, it claimed, estimated that 40-75 per cent of accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or duplicates.

Block shares slumped sharply after the allegations were levelled against it.

Block reportedly said the Hindenburg report was “factually inaccurate and misleading” and threatened to “explore legal action” against the short seller.

The latest report by the US-based short seller firm comes about two months after it raised concerns about shares of Adani group companies having a possibility of declining from their current levels, owing to high valuations, and alleged stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Following the report, the Adani group companies’ shares declined sharply, though with varying degrees, and lost value of over USD 100 billion. The continued sell-offs in the group’s stocks led its flagship firm, Adani Enterprises Limited, to cancel a fully subscribed Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offer.

Adani Group responded by saying that the report by Hindenburg Research was not an attack on any specific company but a “calculated attack” on India, its growth story, and ambitions.

Also, in its response to the Hindenburg Research, the Adani Group has attacked Hindenburg as “an unethical short seller”. It added the report was “nothing but a lie”. Adani Group, in its 413-page report, also responded to all 88 questions raised by Hindenburg in detail.

The short-seller’s announcement detailed numerous allegations against Block, led by Jack Dorsey, the cofounder and former CEO of Twitter. Among other claims, the short-seller alleges that Block, formerly known as Square, has misled investors on key metrics, including its user counts and how much it spends targeting new customers, and has opened up Cash App to criminals, claiming the digital wallet is used for sex trafficking and the trafficking of minors.

“The ‘magic’ behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics,” Hindenberg wrote.

Hindenburg says its decision to short Block, which follows a two-year-long investigation, is based on interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts; a review of regulatory and litigation documents; and a series of public records requests.

Block’s share price was down approximately 20% early Thursday, dropping from over $72.94 the day before to $59.80 when markets opened. It recovered a bit, to $63.50, around midday.

The sudden drop in the share price of the payments giant, which has made a series of investments in Bitcoin and crypto, comes shortly after it announced strong growth in revenue and gross profit from Cash App and Square in its most recent quarterly earnings report.

Most of Hindenburg’s allegations centered on Cash App, Block’s flagship mobile payments product released in 2013. The app posted 51 million active users last year, a 16% increase from 2021, while gross profits from the app during the fourth quarter also grew to $848 million, a 64% increase from the same period a year earlier. Like other money-transfer apps, including PayPal’s Venmo, use of Cash App surged during the pandemic, and was used to facilitate COVID-relief payments.

“We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today,” Block wrote in a statement. “We will not be distracted by typical short seller tactics.”

Block released its annual corporate responsibility report on Wednesday, one day before Hindenburg revealed its short position. In the report, Dorsey wrote: “Throughout 2022 we continued to advance our purpose of economic empowerment” through its products, including Cash App. The report also stated that the company “believes in robust oversight over compliance with laws and regulations.”

The giant killer

Hindenburg has made a name for itself betting against unprofitable firms, shell companies, and crypto agencies, but the New York-based short-selling firm stepped up its game earlier this year when it launched an attack on Adani Group, India’s biggest conglomerate.

In January, Hindenburg released a report targeting Adani, the company founded by Gautam Adani with massive holdings in Indian ports, commodities trading, and energy plants. Hindenburg’s report accused Adani of stock manipulation, fraud, and poor leadership, sparking a stock rout that wiped out over $100 billion in Adani’s market value over 10 days.

Adani himself has routinely denied Hindenburg’s accusations, and U.S. investment firms have begun to tentatively bet on his companies again after the Indian conglomerate managed to repay millions in outstanding loans to restore investor confidence in the months since Hindenburg’s short.

Even before bringing down Adani, Hindenburg had made a name for itself as a market mover with several in-depth investigative reports accompanying announcements that it’s shorting a company’s stock.

In 2020, the investment group published a report on Nikola Corporation, an electric vehicle manufacturer, accusing it of defrauding investors and company founder Trevor Milton of making false statements to partner with larger automakers when the company went public. In 2022, Milton was found guilty for deceiving investors with exaggerated claims about his company’s progress in developing zero-emission trucks.

In 2021, after Hindenburg published another report about DraftKings that said it had partnered with a Bulgarian technology company allegedly involved in money laundering, black-market gaming, and organized crime. The Securities and Exchange Commission later subpoenaed the sports-betting operation.

Cash App allegations

In its latest report, Hindenburg wrote that former Block employees said that between 40% and 75% of accounts they reviewed on Cash App were fake, involved in fraud, or one of multiple accounts tied to a single person.

In addition, the short-seller said a series of Department of Justice complaints said Cash App was used in sex-trafficking cases. And it alleged the digital wallet was also used to facilitate fraud related to U.S. government COVID-relief stimulus checks.

To illustrate its point of how Cash App is commonly used for criminal activities, Hindenburg said it had created two clearly fake accounts under the names “Donald Trump” and “Elon Musk,” both of which were deemed legitimate by Cash App. The report also pointed out how the app has entered the cultural zeitgeist with a wave of mentions in popular rap and hip-hop songs, although in many instances artists described using it to “scam, traffic drugs, or even pay for murder,” according to the report. Hindenburg even compiled a video of instances where Cash App was described as being used for criminal purposes in music videos.

Although unwanted attention from Hindenburg has caused companies to collapse and founders to face criminal trials in the past, a damning report from the short-seller is not necessarily a death sentence. Adani Group’s market value recently climbed back to $110 billion from a low of $82 billion earlier this year, The Economist reported last week, after repaying many of its loans and restoring some investor confidence.

(SQ) founded by Jack Dorsey. Hindenburg's report claimed that Block has allowed fraudulent accounts to proliferate on cash applications, generating illegitimate revenue and exaggerating user metrics.

The short seller's report said, ""the “magic"" behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.""

Hindenburg released this report after carrying two years of investigation on Block. The short seller's research includes dozens of interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts, extensive review of regulatory and litigation records, and FOIA and public records requests.

It concluded that Block has systematically taken advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping.

Block which was formerly known as Square Inc, is a $44 billion market cap company. Hindunberg stated that the company claims to have developed a “frictionless"" and “magical"" financial technology with a mission to empower the “unbanked"" and the “underbanked"".

Block offers payment and mobile banking services for merchants and consumers.

The Nathan Anderson-backed research firm shed great limelight on Block's CASH App platform. According to them, Block's climb to stardom comes due adoption of the Cash App.

But Hindenburg claimed that former employees estimated that 40%-75% of accounts on Cash App that they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.

Hindenburg argued that the core of the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally very “underbanked"" segment of the population: criminals. The company’s “Wild West"" approach to compliance made it easy for bad actors to mass-create accounts for identity fraud and other scams, then extract stolen funds quickly.

The case of Block is quite spooky, especially its Cash App which has sparked many hip-hop songs.

Hindenburg's report said, even when users were caught engaging in fraud or other prohibited activity, Block blacklisted the account without banning the user.

A former customer service rep shared screenshots with Hindenburg showing how blacklisted accounts were regularly associated with dozens or hundreds of other active accounts suspected of fraud. This phenomenon of allowing blacklisted users was so common that rappers bragged about it in hip-hop songs.

Hindenburg said, CEO Jack Dorsey has publicly touted how Cash App is mentioned in hundreds of hip-hop songs as evidence of its mainstream appeal. A review of those songs shows that the artists are not generally rapping about Cash App’s smooth user interface—many describe using it to scam, traffic drugs or even pay for murder.

“I paid them hitters through Cash App"" A quote Hindenburg cited while revealing that Block paid to promote a video for a song called “Cash App"" which described paying contract killers through the app. The song’s artist was later arrested for attempted murder.

Also, Cash App was cited by far as the top app used in reported U.S. sex trafficking, according to a leading non-profit organization. Multiple Department of Justice complaints outline how Cash App has been used to facilitate sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of minors.

Hence, Hindenburg said, ""Block can and should clarify to investors an estimate on how many unique people actually use Cash App.""

Beyond facilitating payments for criminal activity, Hindenburg stated that the platform has been overrun with scam accounts and fake users, according to numerous interviews with former employees. Some of the fake accounts on the app have usernames of the biggest individuals such as ""Donald Trump"" and ""Elon Musk"". Even ""Jack Dorsey"" is the user name of multiple fake accounts.

Hindenburg highlighted a bull case for Block. By end of 2019, Block's merchant services accounted for $1.39 billion in gross profit, compared to the consumer-facing Cash App, which accounted for only $457.6 million of gross profit.

But these figures changed drastically during the pandemic. Hindenburg said many merchant businesses locked down and individuals activated millions of Cash App accounts to receive government stimulus and unemployment payments.

By end of 2020, Cash App reported 36 million monthly activities, which has since grown to 51 million. By 2020-end, Cash App's gross profit reached $1.2 billion, a 170% growth rate from the prior year, compared with merchant services gross profit of $1.5 billion, an 8% growth rate from the prior year

Further, Hindenburg reported that even as billions of fraudulent transactions were being processing through Cash App’s platform, Block insiders were hitting the exit to the tune of more than $1 billion in insider stock sales between March 2020, the beginning of the pandemic and December 31, 2021.","Also, Cash App was cited by far as the top app used in reported U.S. sex trafficking, according to a leading non-profit organization.

The apex court clarified that Adani Power will only be liable for what is mentioned in...,None,Supreme Court Upholds Adani Power's Resolution Plan For Korba West Power,"The Supreme Court upheld on Friday the decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, which had approved the resolution plan submitted by Adani Power Ltd. for Korba West Power Co.

There were no ambiguities in the findings of the appellate tribunal, as they reflect that the resolution plan, as approved, is binding on all the stakeholders and cannot be made the subject matter of arbitration or any other proceeding, the apex court said.

If NCLAT has permitted Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. to continue with the arbitration proceedings, it is only with regards to the quantification of their claims, and this will not affect the rights and obligations of the resolution applicant, Adani Power Ltd., the court said.

The top court made it clear that Adani Power cannot be held responsible for any other liability than what is mentioned in the resolution plan.

Last month, NCLAT upheld Adani Power’s resolution plan for Korba West Power under an insolvency process initiated by the latter.

An Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal, in 2019, approved the resolution plan submitted by Adani Power for the debt-ridden Korba West.

Certain arbitration proceedings were pending between Korba West Power and Shapoorji Pallonji, prior to the initiation of the insolvency process, and the amount that was claimed by Shapoorji Pallonji was Rs 45.22 crore.

However, after the approval of the resolution plan under the insolvency process, Shapoorji’s claims were rejected by the resolution professional under the insolvency code because of the pending arbitration proceedings. This prompted Pallonji to approach the NCLAT to challenge the resolution plan that was approved in 2019.

It was submitted by Adani Power that any claims, which are not part of the resolution plan, shall stand extinguished and no person would be entitled to continue any proceedings in respect of a claim, which is not part of the resolution plan.

Citing the apex court's judgement in the case of Fourth Dimension Solutions, NCLAT said that where the proceedings were pending before the arbitration authorities, the parties were at liberty to pursue all the contentions available to them at the relevant time.

Essentially, the top court had allowed the parties to pursue pending arbitration proceedings, if any, even after the approval of the resolution plan.

The appellate tribunal, while upholding the approval of the resolution plan, had held that Shapoorji Pallonji was at liberty to pursue all contentions available to them in the pending arbitration proceedings and that the same shall be decided in the said proceedings on its own merits in accordance with law.","The Supreme Court upheld on Friday the decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, which had approved the resolution plan submitted by Adani Power Ltd. for Korba West Power Co.

In the last week of February, S&P Global revised its ratings to negative on Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd., to highlight the governance risks and funding challenges of the wider group. The credit rating agency affirmed the 'BBB-' ratings on these entities.

S&P Global published an FAQ-style commentary titled, ""Adani Group: The Known Unknowns"", wherein the rating agency said the investors are keen to know and have been seeking clarity on the credit impact of a string of allegations against the Adani Group, which were published by US short seller Hindenburg Research on January 24 this year.

""Like much of the market, we are waiting for more information about the Adani Group before deciding the direction of our ratings. We believe further details on governance and funding risks over the next 12-24 months would drive the ratings,"" said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Abhishek Dangra.

Hindenburg Research in its report accused the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate of engaging in brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme, and improper use of offshore tax havens.

In its report, the short-seller said key listed Adani companies have taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their ""inflated stock"" for loans, putting the entire group ""on precarious financial footing"".

The conglomerate in a detailed note denied all the charges. Following which, Gautam Adani's wealth nosedived by more than 60 per cent.

S&P Global in its note said that the Adani Group may face downside risks due to restricted access to funding and also due to a broader view of the quality of the group's governance.

“For example, we are likely to take a negative rating action should any investigation uncover serious wrongdoing. This may include previously undisclosed material related-party loans, cash leakage, or misreporting,"" S&P Global said.

It added: ""Conversely, to revise the outlook to stable, we will need to be convinced that governance practices in the group and funding access will improve in line with an investment-grade credit profile.""

The agency further added that it is closely watching for key points, which include the report of the Supreme Court-appointed independent panel of experts, which is individually probing the potential regulatory shortcomings in the oversight and disclosures of Adani Group.

The apex court on March 2 also directed capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to submit its findings to the panel in two months.

S&P said that if the high-level probe shows illegal activities by the group, the agency would revise its ratings from fair to weak.

“If the investigation proves illegal activities by the group or points to serious wrongdoing, we could revise our assessment of management and governance down to weak from fair. This could result in a downgrade, potentially of more than one notch, depending on the effect of such activities on the credit profile,” S&P said.

It added that any significant adverse audit observations, qualified audit opinions for the year ending March 31, 2023, or significant reporting and disclosure weakness identified by any company-appointed independent external reviewers may also trigger a revision. ""We will also review the group's ability to raise equity and debt, both via private placement or through public debt markets,"" it said.

Earlier this month, US-based and Australia-listed boutique investment firm GQG Partners Inc bought shares worth $1.87 billion in four Adani group companies. GQG Partners, through block deals, bought shares worth Rs 154.46 billion in four Adani group companies, including the conglomerate's flagship firm Adani Enterprises, a regulatory filing showed. The shares were sold by an Adani family trust, using Jefferies as a broker.

S&P in its Wednesday note said: “Any fresh share-backed loans raised by promoters could pose funding risks for the larger Adani Group and rated entities,"" S&P said.

Management, it said, may review growth plans, capital expenditure (capex), leverage tolerance, and financial policies for group entities.

The report highlighted that Adani Group’s relationship with domestic and international banks will be critical to meeting the group's funding needs. “Security and repayments terms will affect the group's financial flexibility,” S&P said in its report.

“Assessing the group's creditworthiness, leverage and liquidity position is difficult given our reliance on public information for unrated listed entities. We also rely on limited public disclosures of unlisted, private entities, and of funding or liabilities at the promoter level,"" said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Richard Langberg.

The Indian conglomerate, nonetheless, intends to meet original timelines for completion, its listed unit Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) said in a disclosure to the Bombay Stock Exchange on 21 March.

Building the project in the western Gujarat state is expected to take four years, with commissioning targeted by 2025-2026.

“The financial closure of the green PVC project is pending with the financial institutions, and it is in their active consideration,” AEL said.

“Due to recent market developments, the management has decided to continue with the engineering design and other activities including financial closure in an accelerated mode,” the company said.

“Pending the above, it has been decided to keep the major equipment procurement and site construction activities on hold,” it added, confirming media reports early in the week that work on the project was halted.

Construction will resume once funding is secured in the next six months, it said.

“We are committed to completing the project in an expeditious manner so as to meet the original timelines,” AEL said.

It was not clear at the time of writing on how far along project construction has gone before the work suspension.

Adani Group, which has various listed subsidiaries, has lost more than $145bn in market capitalisation in a month after US-based investment firm Hindenburg Research released a report on 24 January accusing the conglomerate of stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens.

After taking a beating on the bourses, following the report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, many of the group stocks have recovered some lost ground. However, amid sluggish broader market trends, the group's stocks have declined in the last few trading sessions.

The explosive report had made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against it. The Adani group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

However, on January 29, the conglomerate had said, in response to Hindenburg Research’s allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, that Vinod Adani “does not hold any managerial position in Adani listed companies”.

While technically it may be true that Vinod Adani doesn’t have any managerial position in the company, but the fact that the Adani Group is saying that ‘he and Adani should be seen as one’, as per CNBC, in terms of ownership, it can be assumed he also has influence on the management of the company.

In a response to a query from CNBC-TV18, it said: “Endeavour Trade and Investment, controlled by Vinod Adani, the Acquirer of ACC and Ambuja Cements, belongs to Adani Group”. This clarifies that the Adani Group and Vinod Adani should be seen as one.”https://t.co/iLI7vyM6p4 — CNBC-TV18 (@CNBCTV18News) March 15, 2023

The company’s latest statement refocuses attention on Adani Group companies and their free float position.

Publicly traded companies are required to have at least 25% of their shares held by non-promoters – be it retail investors, mutual funds, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), and insurance companies – to stay listed on exchanges. These shares are called public float or free float or public shareholding.

What is ‘free float’?

Free float refers to the shares of a company that can be publicly traded and are not restricted (i.e., held by insiders). It helps investors as it provides a more accurate representation of the stock’s true value. This is also required to mitigate manipulation and insider trading.

Data from Trendlyne shows in the case of Adani Group, a few investment funds hold most of the free float.

The pie charts below are in the form of a time slide. They show data from three years ending December 2020, December 2021, and December 2022. The information for rest of the FPIs* is not available on the website.

Adani Enterprises’ share price jumped 2735% in 2.5 years, from Rs 141.40 on April 30, 2020 to Rs 4,008.85 on November 11, 2022.



The Wall Street Journal reported in February this year that Opal Investment Pvt. Ltd – one of the FPIs in Adani Power – is linked with the Adani family. The Mauritius-based company was formed by Trustlink International Ltd, a financial-services firm with ties to the Adani family, the report said.

One of Trustlink’s directors, Louis Ricardo Caillou, is on the board of Opal. Caillou is also named as a board member of another Mauritius-based firm, Krunal Trade & Investment Pvt. Ltd.

Vinod Adani is also a director at Krunal Trade & Investment, along with Subir Mittra, the chief executive of the Adani family office.

Adani Power had in its latest quarterly reports described Opal as an independent shareholder that has no ties to the conglomerate beyond a 4.69% stake in the company in its quarterly report, the report said.



Adani Power’s shares increased by 166.8% in two years, from Rs 342.50 on September 11, 2020, to Rs 913.80 on September 23, 2022.

Adani Transmission’s shares jumped by 757% in nearly two years, from Rs 477.20 on January 20, 2021 to Rs 4,094.75 on September 16, 2022.

In its report, Hindenburg Research said that “New Leaina [one of the FPIs in Adani Green Energy] is operated by incorporation services firm Amicorp, which has worked extensively to aid Adani in developing its offshore entity network. Amicorp formed at least seven Adani promoter entities, at least 17 offshore shells and entities associated with Vinod Adani, and at least three Mauritius-based offshore shareholders of Adani stock.”

Adani Green Energy’s shares jumped by 678% in nearly two years, from Rs 370.45 on August 7, 2020 to Rs 2,882.80 on April 29, 2022.

Adani Total Gas’s shares increased by 338% in two years, from Rs 893.90 in January 15, 2021 to Rs 3918.90 in January 20, 2023.

Interestingly, the rest of the FPIs, whose details are not available online, keeps on increasing year on year. Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee had in September 2022 written about these “silent soldiers”, or “Adani’s fortune drivers”, and that “they deserve some scrutiny”.

As of December 2020, the rest of the FPIs held 4.16% in Adani Enterprises. The holding increased to 7.70% and 11.02% in December 2021 and 2022, respectively. In Adani Power, as on December 2020, the rest of the FPIs held 7.81%. The holding increased to 7.43% and 11.59% in December 2021 and 2022, respectively.

The same is the case for all the group firms analysed in this piece.

Free float norms

The pie charts also show that in some group companies, a majority of the group’s investments’ free float has been held by offshore funds.

According to OpenCorporates, at least four of these funds, namely Cresta Fund, Albula Investment, APMS Investment Fund, and LTS Investment Fund, have the same address: Edith Cavell Street, Port Louis, Mauritius.

As per Hindenburg, Cresta Fund, Albula Investment, APMS Investment Fund, and LTS Investment Fund, along with another fund, Lotus Global Investment Fund, are all controlled by Monterosa Investment Holdings, per Legal Entity Identifier data.

Additionally, one of the anchor investors in the Rs 20,000 crore share sale, which Adani had to call off, was Aviator Global Investment Fund. Its senior management official Antonino Sardegno led “investment solutions” from 2008 to 2013 for Monterosa Group, Forbes reported.

Given that, the promoters held 74.92% as on December 2020 and 2021, and 72.63% in December 2023, in Adani Enterprises, the free float comes down to just over 25%.

Promoters held 74.92% as on December 2020 and 2021. As per data, the non-promoter holding (in the form of FPIs) accounted for at least 10-15%. But 1) three of the funds have the same address, 2) as per reports, some of these funds have links to the Adani family, and 3) three funds are controlled by a single fund, Monterosa.

So, if the offshore funds are to be accounted for having links to the Adani family, then the free float would slip to just under 25%, or even less than that.

According to an analysis by the Morning Context, “if you remove these [offshore] funds, the effective [public] shareholding in Adani Enterprises comes down to only 10%.” In Adani Transmission, the “effective public float is about 7-8%”.

This would be acceptable if it was established that these funds were not owned by people from the Adani family or linked to them.

However, the ownership of these funds is unknown because Mauritius is a tax haven.

Per a Forbes report, Vinod Adani was a key player in Adani Group’s big deals. In fact, by the Adani Group’s own admission, Vinod Adani is the ultimate beneficiary of ACC and Ambuja Cements, not Gautam Adani. He was also at the heart of another massive deal with French energy giant TotalEnergies.

And as per Hindenburg, Vinod Adani, or his close associates, manage 38 shell companies based in Mauritius.

We have identified 38 Mauritius shell entities controlled by Vinod Adani and close associates. We have also identified entities that are surreptitiously controlled by Vinod Adani in Cyprus, the UAE, Singapore, and several Caribbean Islands. (15/x) — Hindenburg Research (@HindenburgRes) January 25, 2023

In July 2021, much before Hindenburg released its report, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had written to the custodians of FPIs owning shares in six Adani Group firms, seeking information on their “ultimate beneficiary owners”. These funds included Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund, and APMS Investment Fund.

As mentioned earlier, these funds have the same address.

All this leaves us with some major questions:

1. Who is the ultimate owner of these funds?

Hindenburg has alleged that Vinod Adani operates 38 shell companies in Mauritius. The short seller, however, has not released a list of these funds.

The Indian Express has reported that one of the Mauritius-based funds, Elara, has invested independently in India as well.

Elara India Opportunities Fund is a promoter entity in a defence company, in which Adani Group is a co-owner. The Bengaluru-based company, Alpha Design Technologies Private Limited, has a Rs 590-crore contract with the Union government.

2. Doesn’t this put a red flag on the company’s free float status?

As mentioned earlier, listed companies are required to maintain a minimum public holding of 25%. Being listed is critical as it allows a company to raise money from the market.



However, if these rules are not met, there are implications on these companies’ public listing status.

On March 15, stock exchanges froze the promoter shareholding of Patanjali Foods after the company failed to meet the 25% public shareholding within the stipulated time period. According to Business Standard, the promoter stake in the Baba Ramdev-backed company is currently at 80.82%.

Published on March 21 at 8:30 pm, this story was updated to clarify that it may be true that Vinod Adani doesn’t have any managerial position in the firm, but the fact that the Adani Group is saying that ‘he and Adani should be seen as one’, in terms of ownership, it can be assumed he also has influence on the company’s management.","New Delhi: On March 16, the Adani Group said that Vinod Adani, Gautam Adani’s elder brother, is part of the “promoter group” of various listed entities.

BENGALURU, March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. boutique investment firm GQG Partners' $1.87 billion investment in four Adani Group companies in early March single-handedly helped foreign portfolio investors (FPI) record net purchases of Indian equities in the first half of the month.

FPIs bought equities worth 125.75 billion rupees ($1.52 billion) between March 1 and 15, the most since November 2022, according to National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) data.

Excluding GQG's investment, FPIs would have extended their two-month-long selling streak into the first half of March.

Reuters Graphics

Analysts expect that foreign selling in domestic equities is likely to continue for a few more months due to fears of a global banking contagion after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, among others.

""Expect more worms to come out,"" said Aishvarya Dadheech, fund manager at Ambit Asset Management.

The fall of U.S. regional banks is a dampener for both the interest rate cycle and inflation as the Fed will be expected to go slow on further rate hikes, said G Chokkalingam, founder and chief investment officer at Equinomics Research.

It will take at least three to four months for FPIs to get confidence in Indian equities, he added.

The benchmark Nifty 50 (.NSEI) fell nearly 2% in the first half of March compared to a 1.5% slide in MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS)

THE PURCHASES AND SALES

Foreign investors bought over 66 billion rupees worth of shares in the services sector, while the power and automobiles segments witnessed inflows of more than 30 billion rupees each.

Reuters Graphics

FPIs dumped over 37 billion rupees worth of equities in the information technology sector in the first half of March, having bought nearly 11 billion rupees worth of equities in February.

The U.S. banking, financial, services and insurance (BFSI) sectors is a key revenue segment for Indian IT firms and a banking crisis will hurt inflows and growth in these firms, analysts said.

The BFSI contribution to the revenue of IT companies like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro is above 25%, according to earnings reports. ($1 = 82.6700 Indian rupees)

We assume regulators, auditors and stock exchanges are doing their jobs in preventing fraud and malfeasance. Then a major scam happens, like at Enron, Volkswagen, Theranos, etc. Everyone proposes governance reforms and we think the problem is solved… until the next scandal hits.

The recent Adani scandal again highlights our need for better regulations and effective corporate governance. In 2020, much before Hindenburg’s report, allegations had arisen that the group was involved in fraud, money laundering and environmental destruction. The group was accused of concealing losses in subsidiaries, inflating profits and using complex offshore structures to avoid taxes. Over-invoiced imports to siphon money abroad was another charge. As proper oversight could have flagged such issues in time, this fiasco raises questions of corporate governance in India. The term refers to the system of rules, practices and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. It encompasses everything from the oversight role of a board of directors over its management to internal controls, audit practices and risk buffers. The goal of governance is to see that a company operates ethically, transparently and in the best interests of all stakeholders. India’s Companies Act of 2013 sets out a legal framework for it, with guidelines and rules governing various aspects.

Yet, the Adani episode exposed loopholes. The primary problem identified was a lack of independent directors, with group company boards comprising mostly family members and close associates. Another issue was lack of transparency in its financial reporting. Adani Group companies have been accused of using complex structures to evade taxes and manipulate stock prices. While India does have a robust legal framework, weak enforcement seems to be a problem. This is compounded by business ties with politics that could make it difficult for regulators to act against powerful corporate entities. The role of auditors has also been placed in a spotlight. They must verify financial statements for accuracy and reliability. However, they are often caught napping or looking away.

To address these issues, India may need to strengthen its corporate governance framework. Ties of business with politics need to be explained. Other measures should be aimed at increasing transparency in ownership structures, enhancing the independence and accountability of auditors, and improving the enforcement of rules. Regulators and policymakers must work together to create a level playing field for all businesses, regardless of their size or political connections.

Indian opposition leaders accuse the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) of laxity in investigating charges against Adani. As a regulator, it should have full independence in conducting a probe. Remember the fate of recommendations on governance made by a panel led by Uday Kotak? Powerful business lobbies got to work, their implementation was first delayed and now seems shelved. This sort of thing mustn’t happen anymore.

Given the impact on India’s stock market of charges against the Adani Group, Sebi, which was seized of questions over its adherence to free-float norms well before the Hindenburg report appeared, should have been on alert. Anyhow, here is what can be done now:

Strengthen disclosure requirements: Sebi could require companies to disclose more information on their ownership structures, related-party transactions and tax liabilities. Opaque practices designed to evade taxes vanish once they are exposed to light.

Improve monitoring of corporate actions: Sebi could enhance its monitoring of corporate deals, such as mergers and acquisitions, to ensure that they are in the best interests of shareholders and do not involve any conflicts of interest. Stricter or more enforceable rules on the appointment and removal of directors could also make a difference.

Tougher enforcement: Sebi could take a more active approach to enforcing its regulations by conducting regular audits and inspections of listed companies. It could also deploy harsher penalties for rule violators to deter business misconduct.

Enhance investor awareness and protection: India’s market regulator should educate investors better about their rights and responsibilities. They need protection from fraudulent practices that only regulators can provide. This programme could include stepped-up investor grievance mechanisms, mandatory investor education modules and strengthened whistleblower protections.

Better collaboration with other regulatory bodies: Sebi should work more closely with other regulatory bodies, such as the Reserve Bank of India and Union ministry of corporate affairs, to share information and coordinate efforts aimed at combating financial fraud and misconduct.

In general, Sebi should continue to strengthen its regulatory framework and pre-emptively enforce regulations to ensure that Indian markets for securities remains fair, transparent and trustworthy.

The Adani scandal exposed weaknesses in Indian corporate governance. It is essential that the issues raised are addressed for India to make the most of its economic potential. The country must attract investment, create jobs and build a sustainable economy.

By strengthening corporate governance, India can create a business environment conducive to long-term prosperity.

Jairam Ramesh says party's JPC demand still stands...",2023-03-22 14:31:35+00:00,"‘Hum Adani Ke Hai Kaun’ finale: Congress ends series with 100th question to Modi, and a Dev Anand song","New Delhi: The Congress Wednesday concluded its ‘Hum Adani Ke Hai Kaun’ protest campaign series with its 100th question to Prime Minister Narendra Modi — whether the SEBI, ED, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and CBI will take action against the Adani Group.

“Opaque offshore entities such as Monterosa Group, Elara India Opportunities Fund, Cresta Fund etc. appear guilty of ‘stock parking’, in which a third party holds shares to conceal the actual owner’s ownership or control before regulators. Will SEBI act?” the party asked in a statement.

“You have also effectively used it (ED) to enrich your cronies e.g. using ED raids to ‘encourage’ the previous owner of Mumbai airport to sell it to the Adanis. However we pray that you will also use the ED as originally intended and investigate the Adani Group’s alleged money-laundering and round-tripping,” it added.

It also made a similar allegation about the CBI and its operations.

Almost every day since 5 February, the Congress has, as part of its ‘Hum Adani Ke Hai Kaun’ protest series, been posing three questions to the PM on his “relationship” with Gautam Adani and alleged preferential treatment given to the businessman’s conglomerate.

Talking about the corporate affairs ministry, the party said Wednesday that the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) — a statutory agency under the ministry’s jurisdiction — was set up to investigate white-collar crimes.

It’s statement further read that in 2012, the SFIO had filed a chargesheet accusing the Adani Group and Ketan Parekh — a stock broker convicted in 2008 for manipulating the markets — of “making fraudulent gains of Rs 549 crore by manipulating Adani Exports shares”, and had “lodged cases of cheating and criminal conspiracy against Gautam and Rajesh Adani”.

“Yet it went into a slumber after you became PM, waking up a month after the Hindenburg revelations, prompting the Bombay High Court to ask on 22 February 2023 whether the SFIO had sought a hearing because of the ‘scenario outside’! Will the SFIO act sincerely and not just for optics?” the Congress asked.

At the press conference marking the conclusion of the protest series, Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh, who’s been leading the campaign, said that the party would continue to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Adani issue.

“In 1961, a hit film called Jab Pyaar Kisi Se Hota Hota Hai with Dev Anand and Asha Parekh was made. The film had a hit song, ‘Sau saal pehle, mujhe tumse pyaar tha. Aaj bhi hai, aur kal bhi rahega’. Today I’m reminded of that song. ‘Sau sawaal pehle, JPC ki maang thi. Aaj bhi hai, aur kal bhi rahegi,” he said.

Ramesh further said that the demand of the party will stand, irrespective of the argument that such a JPC — if formed — will have more members from the ruling BJP dispensation.

‘JPC would have BJP majority, but govt will have to respond’

At the press conference, Ramesh emphasised that his party’s questions are not directed to Adani, but to Modi.

“The SC constituted expert committee is centered around Adani and will ask them questions. But we are asking questions of the government. Our questions cannot be asked by an SC committee. They will not think about these questions or have the courage to ask them,” he added.

The JPC “will have a BJP majority”, but in spite of that, the opposition will have an opportunity to ask questions, the Rajya Sabha MP said, adding that the government “will have to respond and everything will go on record”.

Besides Ramesh, Congress leader Amitabh Dubey, in-charge of research and monitoring in the party’s communications department, also addressed the press conference. Ramesh said that Dubey was instrumental in the campaign and was involved in framing and publishing the questions over the last one and a half months. Amitabh is the son of Suman Dubey, known to have been a close associate and family friend of Rajiv Gandhi.

According to party sources, the quirky taglines that were part of the campaign, like ‘Dikh raha hai Vinod’, a reference to Gautam Adani’s brother, were coined by Dubey. The ‘DDLJ’ (Deny, Distract, Lie and Justify) dig that Congress recently took at the government’s handling of the China issue. The name of the protest series, however, was Ramesh’s brainchild.

Ambuja Cements rose 1.3 per cent, ACC edged 0.3 per cent higher while NDTV added 0.8 per cent to Rs 175.75.

""The Adani Group strongly refutes the news report published by The Ken, a digital publication, which makes the baseless and deliberately mischievous claim that the Group has not completed repayment of USD 2.15 billion in share-backed debt,"" a Adani group statement read.

The group in a statement said it completed the full prepayment of margin linked share backed financing aggregating to $2.15 billion and all corresponding shares pledged for those facilities have been released.

This is after a report by The Ken raised questions about whether the group actually has repaid debts worth $2.15 billion. The report prompted a fresh bout of selling in Adani group stocks. Later, stock exchanges sought clarification from the group regarding the news report.

As per the present rules, the Adani group statement noted, any share pledge or release is automatically reported by system driven disclosure (SDD) mechanism of the depository participant, and no separate filing is required to be made. The same has already been updated and is reflected on the NSE website.

""However, the BSE website has not been updated to reflect the same,"" it noted.

Besides, it noted that as per the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, Rule 29 (1) & 29 (2) along with 29 (4) stipulates disclosure obligations on pledge or release of 5 per cent or higher number of shares of the company, which in this case was applicable only to Adani Ports and is not applicable to Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy.

""Therefore, only Adani Ports’ disclosure has been filed as per SEBI SAST regulations,"" the group said.

As per the media release of February 6, 12 per cent of Adani Ports shares were

released (which was higher than 5 per cent) and 3 per cent of Adani Green Energy shares and 1.4 per cent of Adani Transmission shares were released. Accordingly, SAST disclosure was applicable only to Adani Ports, the group noted.

Besides, the group noted that there has been incremental prepayment of $134 million completed after the press release February 6 ($1,114 million) and March 7 ($902 million), resulting in the updated debt figure of $2.15 billion for the press release of March 12.

The group in a statement said it completed the full prepayment of margin linked share backed financing aggregating to $2.15 billion and all corresponding shares pledged for those facilities have been released.

This is after a report by The Ken raised questions about whether the group actually has repaid debts worth $2.15 billion. The report prompted a fresh bout of selling in Adani group stocks. Later, stock exchanges sought clarification from the group regarding the news report.

As per the present rules, the Adani group statement noted, any share pledge or release is automatically reported by system driven disclosure (SDD) mechanism of the depository participant, and no separate filing is required to be made. The same has already been updated and is reflected on the NSE website.

""However, the BSE website has not been updated to reflect the same,"" it noted.

Besides, it noted that as per the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, Rule 29 (1) & 29 (2) along with 29 (4) stipulates disclosure obligations on pledge or release of 5 per cent or higher number of shares of the company, which in this case was applicable only to Adani Ports and is not applicable to Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy.

""Therefore, only Adani Ports’ disclosure has been filed as per SEBI SAST regulations,"" the group said.

As per the media release of February 6, 12 per cent of Adani Ports shares were

released (which was higher than 5 per cent) and 3 per cent of Adani Green Energy shares and 1.4 per cent of Adani Transmission shares were released. Accordingly, SAST disclosure was applicable only to Adani Ports, the group noted.

Besides, the group noted that there has been incremental prepayment of $134 million completed after the press release February 6 ($1,114 million) and March 7 ($902 million), resulting in the updated debt figure of $2.15 billion for the press release of March 12.

A major political controversy has erupted after Adani Group stocks took a beating on the bourses after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation.

The Gautam Adani-led group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Meanwhile, according to a recent report, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has continued to invest in two Adani stocks despite the rout following the entire Hindenburg saga. EPFO continues to invest in Adani Ports and Adani Enterprises, and will keep doing so till September at least, unless the organisation reworks its investment approach in this week’s meeting, The Hindu reported.

After the Adani group lost over $100 billion in valuation post scathing allegations by US-based Hindenburg Research, state-run LIC was criticised for having over $4 billion exposure to companies from the group, as per Reuters. According to a report by Bloomberg, State Bank of India has given loans of as much as Rs 21,000 crore ($2.6 billion) to Adani Group firms.

Gandhi, on the other hand, has been attacking the Prime Minister on the Adani issue and has been demanding an investigation into the matter.

He has alleged that his disqualification from the Lok Sabha recently was due to him raising questions on the Adani issue, but asserted that he will continue to do so even if he is disqualified from Parliament for life.

The former Congress chief was disqualified from the Lok Sabha on Friday after he was convicted and sentenced to a two-year jail term in a defamation case by a Surat court.

This has led to a loss of Rs 30,000 crore worth of market capitalisation, CNBCTV18 reported.

The total market capitalisation currently stands at around Rs 9.4 lakh crore, the report added.

According to the report, the Adani Group had a record high market capitalisation of Rs 24 lakh crore in October last year.

Adani Enterprises fell 0.99% to close at Rs 1723.30 on the BSE on Monday.

Adani Ports and SEZ was down by 1.43% to end at Rs 629.10; Adani Power down by 4.98% to close at Rs 183; Adani Transmission 4.98% to close at Rs 1,069.20; Adani Green Energy 4.40% to end at Rs 984.70.

Adani Total Gas was down by 4.91% to close at Rs 958.35 while Adani Wilmar fell by 4.93% to end at Rs 387.65 on the BSE.

Shares in Adani group companies slumped following Hindenburg Research’s January 24 report alleging fraud and market manipulation. The group, controlled by Gautam Adani, has denied the allegations. The selloff wiped more than $100 billion off the conglomerate’s market value.

Meanwhile, in recent developments, the Adani Group has decided to halt some of its proposed investments, especially those without funding commitments, Mint reported, citing people aware of the matter. It has also cut its growth target and capital expenditure.

But the group has been prepaying some loans in the form of share-backed pledges, commercial papers, etc.

The company prepaid loans worth $1.11 billion (approximately Rs 9,200 crore) on February 6, thus releasing pledged shares ahead of their maturity of September 2024.

It also repaid a part of its commercial papers from some domestic mutual funds ahead of their maturity, the Morning Context reported. However, buying back CPs doesn’t make much sense, and by doing this, the company only wants to convey that all is well, an executive at a fund house with exposure to Adani Group’s CPs told the news outlet.

Bloomberg reported in early March that Adani’s Mundra power plant has more liabilities than assets and has run up $1.8 billion ( around Rs 14,500 crore) of losses. However, the Financial Express on March 27 reported that Adani Enterprises is in the advanced stages of of achieving financial closure of Rs 14,500 crore required to partly fund the plant.

Separately, the demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe in the Adani case by opposition parties continues to affect the proceedings of parliament. “We are raising the demand for a JPC on the Adani issue. But the Government of India is not ready to accept the simple JPC demand,” Congress president Mallikarjun said at a protest, adding that a JPC would have more members from the ruling party than the opposition parties and they should have no objection to it.","New Delhi: All the seven Adani Group stocks ended in the red on Monday, March 27 – for the first time in more than a month, i.e.

During a press meet on Saturday, Gandhi insisted that “there is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani” and asked, “There is a question, Rs 20,000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani’s shell companies, where has this money come from? Some of these companies are defence companies. Whose money is being spent on our drone and missile development? Why is the defence ministry not asking this question?”

Though he did not elaborate, Gandhi’s reference to the specific figure of Rs 20,000 crore resonates with two recent developments related to the group and data analysis on monies coming into the Adani Group.

“Over half” of Adani FDI came from “opaque overseas entities”: FT

An analysis by Financial Times this month, using publicly available financial data from India, concluded that almost half of Adani’s $5.7 billion foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows were from “opaque overseas entities with connections to group”.

The Financial Times, on analysing India’s FDI remittance data, reported that offshore companies “linked to the Adanis” and “bearing funds of unclear provenance” invested almost half of all the FDI that came into the Adani Group of companies. This could be said to amount to “Rs 20,000 crore”, the figure Gandhi mentioned in his press conference.

The London-based financial daily had also written in its report about the “the role of hard-to-scrutinise money flows in financing the Indian tycoon’s business empire”. It added that Adani had aligned himself “with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda”.

The report had also stated that these “offshore companies linked to the Adanis” invested at least $2.6 billion in the group between 2017 and 2022, which was 45.4% of the more than $5.7 billion it received in total FDI over the period.

The analysis concluded that the total amount of opaque overseas investments in Adani companies was an underestimation and the actual value will be higher since official FDI numbers in India exclude foreign portfolio investments, “which fall under a different reporting regime”, and also investments in listed companies amounting to less than 10% of their paid-up capital.

Aborted Adani FPO: Rs 20,000 crore

Adani Enterprises had raised Rs 20,000 crore (US$2.5 billion) through a fully subscribed follow-on public offer (FPO) in late January. However, as reported by The Wire, it subsequently called off the FPO as it faced market volatility in the wake of allegations that the parent company Adani Group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud.

The Adani Group had then said in a statement, “Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility, the company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction.”

Forbes magazine has also reported on what it said was “evidence the Adani Group likely bought into” the $2.5 billion share sale. The involvement of Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital – two entities that Hindenburg Research had alleged were linked to Adani – in the share sale “raises questions about whether any of Adani’s personal funds were deployed to help meet the $2.5 billion target”, the business magazine wrote.

“The only way Adani can actually resolve this issue is to illustrate who did buy all of the shares. It would be my speculation that there were insiders,” the report had quoted Tim Buckley, a former investment banker at Citigroup and director at Australia-based Climate Energy Finance, who has been studying the Adani Group for over a decade, as saying.

‘PM is scared of my next speech, which is going to come on Adani’

During the press meet, the Congress leader insisted that he has been targeted for raising uncomfortable questions about the saffron party’s relationship with the corporate house.

“Please understand why I have been disqualified. I have been disqualified because the Prime Minister is scared of my next speech. He is scared of the next speech that is going to come on Adani. I have seen it in his eyes. So, he is terrified of the next speech that is going to come and they don’t want that speech to be in Parliament. That is the issue, that is why first the distraction, now the disqualification,” he said.

Following Gandhi’s press conference, BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad addressed the media on the issue where he said: “We don’t have to defend Adani, BJP never defends Adani, but BJP doesn’t target anyone either.”

The BJP claimed that Gandhi has been disqualified in accordance with a Supreme Court ruling. Prasad spoke about the international business deals the Adani group engaged in during the Congress rule from 2004 to 2014 and also about its investments in Congress-ruled states.

PM Modi or the Modi government are yet to reply in Parliament to the substance of the charge of Adani’s proximity to them. Adani has denied that his longstanding connection with the prime minister has led to preferential treatment.","During a press meet on Saturday, Gandhi insisted that “there is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani” and asked, “There is a question, Rs 20,000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani’s shell companies, where has this money come from?

During a press meet on Saturday, Gandhi insisted that “there is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani” and asked, “There is a question, Rs 20,000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani’s shell companies, where has this money come from? Some of these companies are defence companies. Whose money is being spent on our drone and missile development? Why is the defence ministry not asking this question?”

Though he did not elaborate, Gandhi’s reference to the specific figure of Rs 20,000 crore resonates with two recent developments related to the group and data analysis on monies coming into the Adani Group.

“Over half” of Adani FDI came from “opaque overseas entities”: FT

An analysis by Financial Times this month, using publicly available financial data from India, concluded that almost half of Adani’s $5.7 billion foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows were from “opaque overseas entities with connections to group”.

The Financial Times, on analysing India’s FDI remittance data, reported that offshore companies “linked to the Adanis” and “bearing funds of unclear provenance” invested almost half of all the FDI that came into the Adani Group of companies. This could be said to amount to “Rs 20,000 crore”, the figure Gandhi mentioned in his press conference.

The London-based financial daily had also written in its report about the “the role of hard-to-scrutinise money flows in financing the Indian tycoon’s business empire”. It added that Adani had aligned himself “with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda”.

The report had also stated that these “offshore companies linked to the Adanis” invested at least $2.6 billion in the group between 2017 and 2022, which was 45.4% of the more than $5.7 billion it received in total FDI over the period.

The analysis concluded that the total amount of opaque overseas investments in Adani companies was an underestimation and the actual value will be higher since official FDI numbers in India exclude foreign portfolio investments, “which fall under a different reporting regime”, and also investments in listed companies amounting to less than 10% of their paid-up capital.

Aborted Adani FPO: Rs 20,000 crore

Adani Enterprises had raised Rs 20,000 crore (US$2.5 billion) through a fully subscribed follow-on public offer (FPO) in late January. However, as reported by The Wire, it subsequently called off the FPO as it faced market volatility in the wake of allegations that the parent company Adani Group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud.

The Adani Group had then said in a statement, “Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility, the company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction.”

Forbes magazine has also reported on what it said was “evidence the Adani Group likely bought into” the $2.5 billion share sale. The involvement of Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital – two entities that Hindenburg Research had alleged were linked to Adani – in the share sale “raises questions about whether any of Adani’s personal funds were deployed to help meet the $2.5 billion target”, the business magazine wrote.

“The only way Adani can actually resolve this issue is to illustrate who did buy all of the shares. It would be my speculation that there were insiders,” the report had quoted Tim Buckley, a former investment banker at Citigroup and director at Australia-based Climate Energy Finance, who has been studying the Adani Group for over a decade, as saying.

‘PM is scared of my next speech, which is going to come on Adani’

During the press meet, the Congress leader insisted that he has been targeted for raising uncomfortable questions about the saffron party’s relationship with the corporate house.

“Please understand why I have been disqualified. I have been disqualified because the Prime Minister is scared of my next speech. He is scared of the next speech that is going to come on Adani. I have seen it in his eyes. So, he is terrified of the next speech that is going to come and they don’t want that speech to be in Parliament. That is the issue, that is why first the distraction, now the disqualification,” he said.

Following Gandhi’s press conference, BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad addressed the media on the issue where he said: “We don’t have to defend Adani, BJP never defends Adani, but BJP doesn’t target anyone either.”

The BJP claimed that Gandhi has been disqualified in accordance with a Supreme Court ruling. Prasad spoke about the international business deals the Adani group engaged in during the Congress rule from 2004 to 2014 and also about its investments in Congress-ruled states.

PM Modi or the Modi government are yet to reply in Parliament to the substance of the charge of Adani’s proximity to them. Adani has denied that his longstanding connection with the prime minister has led to preferential treatment.","During a press meet on Saturday, Gandhi insisted that “there is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani” and asked, “There is a question, Rs 20,000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani’s shell companies, where has this money come from?

“The government has not intervened anywhere. Nobody’s having to rescue anyone in our system,” Bloomberg quoted Sanyal as saying.

The State Bank of India, the country's largest financier, and the Life Insurance Corp., the country's largest life insurer, have extremely small exposures to Adani group companies, said Sanyal, adding that none of the companies is in financial distress.

LIC, which has assets under management of about $539 billion, had exposure to Adani to the tune of over $4 billion.

Sanyal reiterated that our job is to make sure the markets are transparent and liquid and functional. “Transparency and orderly market movement is the only thing we care about. If that is maintained, the prices will sometimes go up, sometimes they’ll come down,” he added.

According to Sanyal, the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank will have no immediate impact on India's startups.

The Adani Group crisis started when the US-based short seller firm Hindenburg Research, led by Nathan Anderson accused the conglomerate of stock market manipulation, money laundering, and accounting fraud via shell firms. The report caused a massive rout in the shares of Adani Group companies.

Even though the Adani Group has denied all these allegations, Gautam Adani lost around $61.7 billion of his wealth on a year-to-date basis. Adani was worth $58.90 billion on Wednesday, much lesser than $150 billion in September 2022.

Meanwhile, the combined market capitalisation (m-cap) of seven-listed firms namely Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Power, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Wilmar tanked by more than Rs 4.50 lakh crore to Rs 8.63 lakh crore on March 23, 2023, from Rs 13.20 lakh crore on March 31 last year.

Gandhi also said his disqualification would help the party as it has given the Congress new weapon. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi (PTI Photo)(PTI)

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hit back an hour later, accusing Gandhi of resorting to lies to defend a speech he made in London for trying to become a “martyr” to gain political mileage for the upcoming Karnataka assembly elections.

Gandhi made combative remarks at a press conference in the Capital, speaking up directly for the first time since he was disqualified from the Lok Sabha on Friday, and announced he will continue to ask who invested ₹20,000 crore in Adani Group through shell companies and the nature of the PM’s relationship with (Gautam) Adani, the chairman of the Adani Group.

“Please understand why I have been disqualified. I have been disqualified because the Prime Minister is scared of my next speech. He is scared of the next speech that is going to come on Adani. I have seen it in his eyes. So, he is terrified of the next speech that is going to come and they don’t want that speech to be in Parliament. That is the issue, that is why first the distraction, now the disqualification,” he said.

The Congress leader was disqualified after a Surat court convicted him and sentenced him to two years for criminal defamation. Keeping with the law, and a Supreme Court order in 2013, the Lok Sabha secretariat issued a notification saying Gandhi has been disqualified from March 23, the day of the court order.

Gandhi claimed the action against him will give “maximum benefit” to the Congress. “You understand democracy. The panic reaction they have done, Narendra Modi ji, the Opposition will get maximum benefit from this. They have given us weapons. Modi ji is in a panic that the matter will end. He got scared and nervous. They started the whole sequel. He has given the biggest weapon to the Opposition because now the public knows that Adani ji is a corrupt person. The question in people’s mind is, why the Prime Minister of India is trying to save this corrupt person?”

Prasad, at a news conference held shortly after, defended Modi. “We don’t have to defend Adani, BJP never defends Adani, but BJP doesn’t target anyone either,” Prasad said, accusing Gandhi of habitually lying.

Prasad listed international business deals the Adani group had signed when a Congress-led coalition government ruled India from 2004 to 2014 and its investments in states ruled by the Congress.

“So how is Adani group investing 650 billion rupees in a state ruled by your party?” Prasad asked, referring to an announcement by the conglomerate in October that it would invest in the solar power, cement and airport sectors in Rajasthan, which is ruled by the Congress.

Rejecting the BJP’s demand for an apology, Gandhi said: “I am not Savarkar, I am Gandhi, and Gandhis don’t apologise.”

“BJP people said that attack on Adani is attack on the country. That means in their mind the country is Adani, and Adani is the country,” he added.

The Congress said it will organise a satyagraha at statues of Mahatma Gandhi at state and district headquarters from 10am to 5pm on Sunday. In Delhi, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will participate in the protest.

The Congress leader announced he will go back to the people — something his grandmother Indira Gandhi did after her disqualification in 1978. “Rahul Gandhi stayed in the public for four and a half months during Bharat Jodo Yatra and that is my job, I will continue to do that. In today’s India, the support that earlier political parties used to get from the media and other institutions is no longer available. So, there is only one way for the opposition parties, to go among the people,” the former Congress chief said on Saturday.

While he has been disqualified according to a verdict of the Supreme Court, the Congress leader maintained that the BJP’s intensified attacks and the disqualification came after he spoke about Adani during the debate on the President’s speech. “Please, don’t be confused about this matter. There is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani. There is a question, ₹20,000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani’s shell companies, where has this money come from? Some of these companies are defence companies. Whose money is being spent on our drone and missile development? Why is the defence ministry not asking this question?” he said.

In the second half of the budget session that has been a near-washout so far, BJP lawmakers launched a rare protest against Gandhi, demanding his apology for what they said were anti-India comments he made in the UK, a charge Gandhi denied on Saturday. He said he had emphasised that it (attack on Indian democracy) is India’s problem and India must resolve it.

Gandhi said that the demand for his apology for his remarks and other attacks were aimed to distract from the real issue involving the Adani Group.

“I gave documents about the defence industry, (change of rules in) airports, statements made in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Immediately after that, the BJP started its work. I wrote to the Speaker with a detailed explanation with documents. After that, BJP ministers lied about me in Parliament. The whole game was to distract from real issues — whose money came in Adani Group?” Gandhi asked.

In the press conference, Gandhi said he wrote two letters to the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and met him once to seek time to speak in the House. But he alleged that Birla merely smiled at his request.

The Speaker has not said anything on the issue since the controversy erupted.

Gandhi said he is not scared, even if he is permanently disqualified and sent to jail. Saying that it is his tapasya to speak the truth although “it is not fashionable in politics”, the Congress leader said he will write a letter to the people of Wayanad, which he represented, on his disqualification as they are like his family.

He evaded an answer on the ordinance he had dubbed as complete nonsense in 2013 and when asked about the Adani Group’s investments in Congress-ruled states. He reiterated the issue was the source of the ₹20,000 crore investments, and said that if Congress chief ministers are involved, they can be sent to jail.

Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot were present on the stage with Gandhi.

Is there more steam?","Adani's cement stocks on Tuesday recorded a steep selloff. Both Ambuja Cements and ACC stock have dipped by around 4% each. The slippery slope in Ambuja and ACC comes after the Gautam Adani-backed group released its blueprint for future goals in the cement business. The conglomerate plans to double capacity, focus on high growth states, ramp up demand, increase shares in various verticals, and diversify asset footprint were some of the few major goals.

Ambuja stock traded near its day low currently. At the time of writing, Ambuja Cements traded at ₹357 apiece down by ₹12.75 or 3.45% on BSE. The stock has shed at least 4.2% with an intraday low of ₹354.20 apiece earlier in the day. The company's market cap is over ₹71,036 crore as of now.

Meanwhile, ACC stock slipped by ₹73.65 or 4.4% to trade at ₹1,611.15 apiece on BSE. The stock touched a new 52-week low of ₹1,593.50 apiece earlier in the day.

Ambuja Cements is the largest stock of Adani in the cement space. While Adani holds a majority stake in ACC through Ambuja.

As of December 31, 2022, the Group holds s 63.15% stake in Ambuja Cement which in turn owns 50.05% in ACC Limited. Adani directly owns a 6.64% stake in ACC.

In the investors presentation that the group released on March 27, Adani announced that the group plans to double capacity to 140 MTPA from the current 67.5 MTPA going forward in the cement business (Ambuja and ACC). The group has set ₹7,000 crore capital expenditure for doubling capacity 140 MTPA including additional capacity unlocking through debottlenecking. Accordingly, Adani expects net sales to rise to ₹70,000 crore by FY28 fiscal compared to ₹29,700 crore so far in FY23.

Furthermore, Adani expects aims EBITDA per ton to rise to ₹1,470 by FY28 from the current ₹1,000. Also, EBITDA margins are trajected to expand from 19% to 25% in FY28.

Also, the group plans a well-diversified asset footprint to cater pan-India cement demand (incl. captive coal mine – Gare Palma/Dahegaon Gowari). Further, Adani aims to achieve the lowest cost to serve by leveraging Group’s vast experience and unmatched adjacencies in all critical areas such as group infrastructure and digital platform, energy cost, and supply chain.

On the overall industry level, Adani expects strong volume growth on the back of projected GDP growth and proposed infra spend in the budget. Further, the group believes that cement per capita consumption offers good headroom for growth (global average of 525 kg per person vs 250 kg in India).

Adani expects the demand-capacity gap to remain narrow (demand growth of ~7% and capacity growth of ~6% over FY23-FY28) for the industry. While capacity utilization is seen in the range of 70% -75%. Also, it expects price realisations to remain healthy.

According to Emkay Global, the Adani Group filed an investor presentation with the stock exchanges, unveiling its roadmap for capacity expansion and cost efficiencies. Management: i) re-iterated its guidance of doubling capacity to 140mt by FY28 (16% CAGR), at a CAPEX of Rs460 billion (USD77/ton) to be funded via internal accruals; ii) stated its target of achieving consolidated EBITDA of Rs175 billion, with EBITDA/ton of Rs1,470 by FY28; iii) aims for Rs300-400/ton EBITDA improvement in FY24, through operational efficiencies. The Group has also outlined a few projects totaling 24mt cement capacity expansion (vs 11mt announced earlier), aimed to be commissioned in the next 2-3 years.

Also, the brokerage outlined that the Group is also looking at various sales & marketing initiatives, like i) focus on nine high-growth states (for cement): Rajasthan, Punjab, HP, UP, J&K, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, and Karnataka; ii) leveraging group adjacencies to drive premium-quality green cement volumes; iii) focus on special application premium cement (22% of trade sales); iv) increase in the share of B2B segment; v) increase in productivity of the technical services team to convert IHB leads; and vi) emphasis on digitization initiatives.

In its research note, Emkay said, ""We are awaiting clarity on clinker capacity expansion, equipment ordering, and conversion of warrants.""

In regards to Adani's cement stocks, Emkay's note concluded, ""we have a HOLD rating on Ambuja Cements, with target price of Rs425/share, based on 15x FY25E EV/E.""

Shimla, March 28

The issue of the alleged exploitation of apple growers by an Adani Group company was raised in the Vidhan Sabha today. Members said that an agreement should have been signed with the company before three controlled atmospheric (CA) stores set up in the apple belt were handed over to it.

Consult growers to fix apple rates Theog MLA Kuldeep Rathore said that the Adani Group had set up the first CA store in 2006 to save apple growers from exploitation by middlemen and commission agents but now ‘it is exploiting them’

Shimla Urban MLA Harish Janartha said apple procurement rates must be decided in consultation with the growers and there should be some mechanism to control rate fixing

Horticulture Minister Jagat Singh Negi assured the House that action would be taken against the Adani Group company if violation of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act or other malpractices were detected in the running of CA stores in the apple belt.

Negi was replying to a query asked by Theog MLA Kuldeep Rathore during the Question Hour in the Vidhan Sabha. He said that the CA stores were constructed under the National Horticulture Board and with the help of NABARD funds from 2008 to 2011 and no MoU was signed before these were handed over to the Adani Group.

Negi said, “We will examine the legal aspects of the issue to see if after so many years we can sign an MoU to protect the interests of the apple growers.” Rathore said that the CA stores in the Shimla apple belt were handed over to the Adani Group without signing an MoU. “When the apple season starts, the Adani company announces procurement rates and the fruit prices fall suddenly, causing huge losses to the growers,” he alleged.

The minister said that the Adani Group had been provided a grant of Rs 15.98 crore through NABARD under the National Horticulture Board to set up CA stores but no MoU was signed. “The Adani Group company has set up three CA stores at Sainj (Theog), Mehdali (Rohru) and Revali (Kumarsain) in Shimla district,” he added.","Tribune News ServiceShimla, March 28The issue of the alleged exploitation of apple growers by an Adani Group company was raised in the Vidhan Sabha today.

A Government official said: “Airlines have written to the AERA to not implement any increase in the aeronautical tariff in the Third Control Period and defer any increase in the same to the next control period because it will impact the airlines adversely.”

While the parking and landing charges are paid by the airlines, the UDF is a fee levied on the passenger’s ticket to utilise the facilities at the airport.

In the past one year, tariffs at Ahmedabad and Mangalore airports have been increased.

“The proposed tariffs at Lucknow airport are exorbitant. This kills all airlines equally. Airlines are already grappling with losses, and they are still making up for the past three years of covid, higher ATF costs and now the inflation. This will make it difficult for airlines to sustain the cash flow. The only option then is to pass it on to the customers making airfares extremely higher at the airport,” said an airline official.

The proposed landing, parking and user development charges are decided according to domestic and international segments and according to the size of the aircraft.

An official said: “As compared to the narrow body aircraft (B-737/A320), the increase proposed for the smaller aircraft is almost double that of the increase proposed in the narrow body aircraft.”

Major impact seen

He explained that this will have a major impact on the regional connectivity scheme (RCS), “The RCS was implemented to increase connectivity to comparatively smaller regional airports like Lucknow and also to far flung airports, especially by smaller aircraft,” he said.

“Even if it is not a regional route, the charges are eventually passed on to the passengers to an extent making air travel extremely expensive for the customer. And the user development fees too have been proposed to be hiked by approximately 480 per cent,” an official source said.

He said based on the metric tonne of a Q-400, which is 30 metric tonnes, the proposed approximate increase is 158-184 per cent from existing charges. On the other hand, for a large aircraft like Boeing 737-800, the approximate proposed increase is between 108 per cent and 130 per cent from existing charges.

Similarly, for landing charges for the International on Q-400 approximate increase would be between 248 per cent and 283 per cent from existing charges; and on B-737-800 approximately increase between 127 per cent and 150 per cent.

Parking charges

On the parking charges too, on the domestic front, Lucknow International Airport Limited has proposed to increase the tariffs, which would impact the tariffs for an aircraft such as Q-400 by approximately between 418 per cent and 471 per cent from existing charges.

An airline official requesting anonymity said, for landing and parking charges, LIAL has proposed to reduce the number of tariff slabs, which is contrary to airline interests.","Indian airlines have raised objections over the proposed landing and parking charges increase at Adani-owned Lucknow airport, said sources at Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA).

The nationwide protest by Israelis against the plans to overhaul the judicial system led to a major impact.



Massive protests across Israel have cut the country off from the outside in several ways and threaten to paralyse the economy. Its several major ports, including Haifa Port, have ceased work. Adani Ports and SEZ own 70 per cent of the port.



Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone tumbled as much as 5 per cent on Tuesday, before recovering to Rs 602.30 at 10.20 am. The scrip had settled at Rs 629.10 on Monday. However, the company commanded a market cap of Rs 1.3 lakh crore.



Shares of Adani Ports have plunged as much as 30 per cent in the year 2023 so far, whereas it is trading 40 per cent below its 52-week high at 987.90 on September 20, 2022.



A consortium of India's Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) and Israel's Gadot Group won the tender in July last year to privatise the Port of Haifa for a staggering $1.18 billion. It completed the process of purchase on January 11 this year. Adani Ports owns 70 per cent, whereas Gadot Group owns 30 per cent.



The Port of Haifa is the second largest port in Israel in terms of shipping containers and the biggest in shipping tourist cruise ships. About 99 per cent of all goods move in and out of Israel by sea and port upgrades are needed to maintain economic growth.



According to the media reports, the agitating workers protested against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s judicial reforms. Protesters were reported to gather in Jerusalem, near the supreme court and Israel’s parliament Knesset.



Shares of Adani Group have been reeling under pressure for more than two months after the US-based short-seller Hindenburg alleged the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate of high debt levels and financial manipulation in the financial statements.

NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s top opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he was being targeted because he has raised serious questions about Modi’s relationship with the Indian business conglomerate Adani Group.

Gandhi said the objective of his expulsion from Parliament on Friday was to prevent him from speaking in the legislature about his allegation of an infusion of an unaccounted $3 billion into shell companies owned by the Adani Group, headed by Gautam Adani.

”Some of these defense companies are working in drone and missile development and ordnance production. Why is the defense ministry not asking questions,” he said.

Gandhi was expelled from Parliament a day after a court convicted him of defamation and sentenced him to two years in prison for mocking the surname Modi in an election speech.

The actions against Gandhi, the great-grandson of India’s first prime minister, were widely condemned by opponents of Modi as the latest assaults against democracy and free speech by a ruling government seeking to crush dissent. Removing Gandhi from politics delivered a major blow to the opposition party he led ahead of next year’s national elections.

Gandhi said he was not bothered about losing his seat in Parliament. “My job is to defend the institutions of the country and the voice of people,” he added.

A court in the western Indian city of Surat also sentenced him to two years in prison on Thursday. But he won’t go to jail immediately as the court granted bail for 30 days to file an appeal against the verdict.

The court convicted Gandhi for a 2019 speech in which he asked, “Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?” Gandhi then referred to three well-known and unrelated Modis in the speech: a fugitive Indian diamond tycoon, a cricket executive banned from the Indian Premier League tournament and the prime minister.

On Saturday, Gandhi didn’t indicate how soon his legal team will approach an appeals court seeking to overturn his conviction so he could save his seat in Parliament.

He accused Modi of helping the Adani Group to get contracts in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia.

He also alleged that a Chinese national was involved in investments in Adani’s shell companies. “Why nobody is asking the question who this Chinese national is,” he said. ”Nobody knows where this money has come from. Adani couldn’t generate this money.”

Gandhi has demanded a parliamentary committee probe following a report by Hindenburg Research, the U.S. financial research firm, accusing the Adani Group of stock price manipulation and fraud running into billions of dollars. The Adani Group has denied any wrongdoing and the Modi government has not accepted a call for a parliamentary investigation.

Soon after Gandhi’s news conference, Ravi Shankar Prasad, a top leader of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, rejected Gandhi’s accusations and said his disqualification from Parliament had nothing to do with the Adani Group controversy.

Since Modi became prime minister in 2014, Adani’s net worth has shot up nearly 2,000% to $125 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. He surpassed Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to briefly become the world’s second richest man in September after a surge in the value of his seven listed entities.

MUMBAI, April 1 (Reuters) - India's market regulator is investigating possible violation of 'related party' transaction rules in the Adani Group's dealings with at least three offshore entities that have links to the brother of the conglomerate's founder, two people said.

The three entities allegedly entered into several investment transactions with unlisted units of the ports-to-power conglomerate founded by billionaire Gautam Adani over the last 13 years, said the sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

Vinod Adani, Gautam Adani's brother, is either a beneficial owner, director or has links with those three offshore entities, said the two sources, adding the regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), is probing if lack of that disclosure violated 'related party transaction' rules.

Under Indian laws, direct relatives, promoter groups and subsidiaries of listed companies are considered related parties.

A promoter group is defined as an entity that has a large shareholding in a listed company and can influence company policy.

Transactions between such entities have to be disclosed in regulatory and public filings and require shareholder approval above a specified threshold. Violations typically attract monetary fines.

An e-mail to SEBI requesting comment was not answered. SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch declined to comment on the Adani investigations at a news conference on Wednesday.

An Adani Group spokesperson said Vinod Adani is a member of the Adani family and is part of the promoter group, but he does not hold any managerial position in any of the listed Adani entities or their subsidiaries.

""This fact, like all other material information required to be reported, has been disclosed to the regulatory authorities in the past and also as and when required,"" the spokesperson added, without commenting on the regulatory probe into offshore entities.

Vinod Adani could not be reached for comment. Requests for comment sent to his holding company in Dubai, Adani Global Investment DMCC, were not responded to.

The probe comes after U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research's Jan. 24 report alleging improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation by Adani Group, among other things - charges it has denied.

Hindenburg's report eroded more than $100 billion in the value of shares in Adani group of companies.

India's Supreme Court asked SEBI in March to investigate the Adani Group for any lapses related to public shareholding, related party rules or regulatory disclosures.

SEBI's investigation into Adani's possible 'related party' transactions with offshore entities with links to Vinod Adani has not been reported before.

While SEBI investigations are continuing, top regulatory officials are due to give a status report to a court-appointed panel on Sunday, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as investigations are private.

'DISCLOSURE VIOLATIONS'

Hindenburg in its January report alleged that Vinod Adani entities have collectively moved ""billions of dollars"" into Adani's publicly listed and private entities, often without required disclosure of the related party nature of the deals.

The Adani Group in a 413-page response to the allegations had said all transactions entered into by it with entities who qualify as 'related parties' under Indian laws and accounting standards have been duly disclosed.

The three offshore entities with links to Vinod Adani being probed for 'related party' transactions are Mauritius-based Krunal Trade and Investments Ltd and Gardenia Trade and Investments Ltd, and Electrogen Infra in Dubai.

There was no response from Krunal, Gardenia and Electrogen Infra to e-mails requesting comment.

While the sources said that other similar transactions are also under regulatory examination, Reuters could not ascertain the names of other entities and their possible violation of 'related party' transaction rules.

SEBI suspects there were ""disclosure violations"" on some of those transactions, said one of the two sources.

If proven, it could lead to monetary penalties and the matter may be referred to India's Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) for transactions that are beyond SEBI jurisdiction, the source said.

MUMBAI, April 1 (Reuters) - India's market regulator is investigating possible violation of 'related party' transaction rules in the Adani Group's dealings with at least three offshore entities that have links to the brother of the conglomerate's founder, two people said.

The three entities allegedly entered into several investment transactions with unlisted units of the ports-to-power conglomerate founded by billionaire Gautam Adani over the last 13 years, said the sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

Vinod Adani, Gautam Adani's brother, is either a beneficial owner, director or has links with those three offshore entities, said the two sources, adding the regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), is probing if lack of that disclosure violated 'related party transaction' rules.

Under Indian laws, direct relatives, promoter groups and subsidiaries of listed companies are considered related parties.

A promoter group is defined as an entity that has a large shareholding in a listed company and can influence company policy.

Transactions between such entities have to be disclosed in regulatory and public filings and require shareholder approval above a specified threshold. Violations typically attract monetary fines.

An e-mail to SEBI requesting comment was not answered. SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch declined to comment on the Adani investigations at a news conference on Wednesday.

An Adani Group spokesperson said Vinod Adani is a member of the Adani family and is part of the promoter group, but he does not hold any managerial position in any of the listed Adani entities or their subsidiaries.

""This fact, like all other material information required to be reported, has been disclosed to the regulatory authorities in the past and also as and when required,"" the spokesperson added, without commenting on the regulatory probe into offshore entities.

Vinod Adani could not be reached for comment. Requests for comment sent to his holding company in Dubai, Adani Global Investment DMCC, were not responded to.

The probe comes after U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research's Jan. 24 report alleging improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation by Adani Group, among other things - charges it has denied.

Hindenburg's report eroded more than $100 billion in the value of shares in Adani group of companies.

India's Supreme Court asked SEBI in March to investigate the Adani Group for any lapses related to public shareholding, related party rules or regulatory disclosures.

SEBI's investigation into Adani's possible 'related party' transactions with offshore entities with links to Vinod Adani has not been reported before.

While SEBI investigations are continuing, top regulatory officials are due to give a status report to a court-appointed panel on Sunday, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as investigations are private.

'DISCLOSURE VIOLATIONS'

Hindenburg in its January report alleged that Vinod Adani entities have collectively moved ""billions of dollars"" into Adani's publicly listed and private entities, often without required disclosure of the related party nature of the deals.

The Adani Group in a 413-page response to the allegations had said all transactions entered into by it with entities who qualify as 'related parties' under Indian laws and accounting standards have been duly disclosed.

The three offshore entities with links to Vinod Adani being probed for 'related party' transactions are Mauritius-based Krunal Trade and Investments Ltd and Gardenia Trade and Investments Ltd, and Electrogen Infra in Dubai.

There was no response from Krunal, Gardenia and Electrogen Infra to e-mails requesting comment.

While the sources said that other similar transactions are also under regulatory examination, Reuters could not ascertain the names of other entities and their possible violation of 'related party' transaction rules.

SEBI suspects there were ""disclosure violations"" on some of those transactions, said one of the two sources.

If proven, it could lead to monetary penalties and the matter may be referred to India's Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) for transactions that are beyond SEBI jurisdiction, the source said.

A fallout of this report was the group halting some investments, cutting down on capital expenditure, and considering a different approach towards financing its projects, according to Bloomberg.

Mundra project, Gujarat

On March 30, Bloomberg reported, citing people aware of the firm’s inner workings, that the Adani Group is unlikely to go ahead with its planned $4 billion petrochemical project in Mundra in Gujarat.

Adani Enterprises had incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Mundra Petrochem Ltd, in 2021 for setting up a greenfield coal-to-PVC plant at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone land in the Kutch district.

DB Power, Chhattisgarh



Adani Power called off the acquisition of DB Power for around Rs 7,000 crore after missing the latest deadline (February 15) to complete the transaction, the Financial Times reported on February 16. It, however, did not give a reason to call off the coal plant project deal in Chhattisgarh.

The firm had acquired the power plant from the Dainik Bhaskar Group on August 18, 2022.

Plans to avoid high-risk financing

In terms of funding its projects, the Adani Group plans to avoid high-risk financing going forward, the people quoted above told Bloomberg.

On March 12, the group had announced that it had paid off $2.15 billion loans which were taken by pledging the shares in the conglomerate.

The news report said that “Adani will stick to fundraising methods like private bond placements and equity stake sales to specific investors — like its share sale to Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners — to raise cash in a way that insulates the empire from volatile market movements.”

Media acquisitions

The group is now unlikely to make more purchases in the media space, people familiar with Adani’s planning told Bloomberg.

In December last year, Adani gained full control of NDTV after it acquired most of the founders’ stake at a premium of almost 17% over the rate it paid to minority shareholders of the firm, the Indian Express reported.

It now holds 64.71% of NDTV, according to a regulatory filing.

Green hydrogen partnership with TotalEnergies

The French energy giant said in February that it was suspending the green hydrogen project with the Indian conglomerate, following Hindenburg Research’s report, which wiped off half of its market value.

“It makes no sense to add more (projects) until there is clarity. Adani has to explain the allegations [by Hindenburg Research],” chief executive of the French oil giant Patrick Pouyanne said, news agency PTI reported.

No bidding for a stake in PTC India

Gautam Adani has decided against bidding for a stake in state-backed electricity trader PTC India Ltd, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on February 20. The decision was taken to preserve cash for the firms amid the market sell-off triggered by the US short seller’s report.

According to the Fitch report, released in Singapore late on Tuesday, if the weaknesses not addressed, they could affect the financial flexibility of the Adani group, which now faces lower governance assessment constraints that have resulted in a rating of 'BBB-'.

Fitch, however, believes that the contagion risk is lower for restricted groups. These groups benefit from structural enhancements such as a defined cash waterfall and limits on the incurrence of additional debt. Hence, their ratings would not be constrained at ‘BBB-’ if other factors driving their credit quality improve.

As of the end of December 2022, most of the senior debt at the Adani group's rated Indian entities was offshore and largely secured, with US dollar bonds that will mature only from mid-2024. Fitch Ratings predicts that the liquidity position of all rated entities or restricted groups will benefit from cash flow generation from January 2023 to March 2024, adding to cash balances at the end of December 2022.

The rating agency also addressed key questions raised by investors on the corporate governance issues, and the debt structure and liquidity position of various rated Indian Adani entities and/or their securities. This is in light of the Hindenburg Research report published on 24 January 2023, alleging various malpractices, leading to a plunge in the share and bond prices of Adani group entities, a Fitch statement said.

At 1345pm, shares of most of the Adani group firms traded higher. Adani Enterprises was up 8.06% at ₹1,730 apiece on the National Stock Exchange, while Adani Ports was at ₹631, up 6.3%.

March 29 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Fitch said two Adani Group subsidiaries were exposed to ""heightened contagion risks"", possibly affecting their financial flexibility, due to weak governance at the parent conglomerate and other companies in the group.

Adani Transmission Ltd (ADAI.NS) and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSE.NS) ""would be capped at current rating level of 'BBB-/Stable' till alleged concerns are ironed out,"" Fitch said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.

Short-seller Hindenburg Research's Jan. 24 report alleged improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation by the ports-to-energy conglomerate - charges it has denied.

Seven listed firms of the Adani Group have shed over $120 billion in market value since the report was published.

Fitch early last month, however, said it had seen no immediate impact on its ratings of Adani Group entities and their securities. It said on Wednesday ""there is no rating impact even now.""

It also said contagion risk was lower for restricted groups including Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd and Mumbai International Airport, as their credit profile was supported by ""structural enhancements,"" including limits on debt.

Fitch defines restricted groups as rated entities that benefit from defined cash flow waterfall and other structural protections.

""There would not be any capping on those (the rating for the restricted groups) if other credit factors support higher than 'BBB-' rating,"" Fitch said. It also said in its report, ""cash flow generation from January 2023 to March 2024 will boost the liquidity of the groups.""

Most Adani group companies gained on Wednesday after a drop in the previous session following a report that said the conglomerate was seeking to renegotiate debt, which the group refuted.

According to the Fitch report, released in Singapore late on Tuesday, if the weaknesses not addressed, they could affect the financial flexibility of the Adani group, which now faces lower governance assessment constraints that have resulted in a rating of 'BBB-'.

Fitch, however, believes that the contagion risk is lower for restricted groups. These groups benefit from structural enhancements such as a defined cash waterfall and limits on the incurrence of additional debt. Hence, their ratings would not be constrained at ‘BBB-’ if other factors driving their credit quality improve.

As of the end of December 2022, most of the senior debt at the Adani group's rated Indian entities was offshore and largely secured, with US dollar bonds that will mature only from mid-2024. Fitch Ratings predicts that the liquidity position of all rated entities or restricted groups will benefit from cash flow generation from January 2023 to March 2024, adding to cash balances at the end of December 2022.

The rating agency also addressed key questions raised by investors on the corporate governance issues, and the debt structure and liquidity position of various rated Indian Adani entities and/or their securities. This is in light of the Hindenburg Research report published on 24 January 2023, alleging various malpractices, leading to a plunge in the share and bond prices of Adani group entities, a Fitch statement said.

At 1345pm, shares of most of the Adani group firms traded higher. Adani Enterprises was up 8.06% at ₹1,730 apiece on the National Stock Exchange, while Adani Ports was at ₹631, up 6.3%.

March 29 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Fitch said two Adani Group subsidiaries were exposed to ""heightened contagion risks"", possibly affecting their financial flexibility, due to weak governance at the parent conglomerate and other companies in the group.

Adani Transmission Ltd (ADAI.NS) and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSE.NS) ""would be capped at current rating level of 'BBB-/Stable' till alleged concerns are ironed out,"" Fitch said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.

Short-seller Hindenburg Research's Jan. 24 report alleged improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation by the ports-to-energy conglomerate - charges it has denied.

Seven listed firms of the Adani Group have shed over $120 billion in market value since the report was published.

Fitch early last month, however, said it had seen no immediate impact on its ratings of Adani Group entities and their securities. It said on Wednesday ""there is no rating impact even now.""

It also said contagion risk was lower for restricted groups including Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd and Mumbai International Airport, as their credit profile was supported by ""structural enhancements,"" including limits on debt.

Fitch defines restricted groups as rated entities that benefit from defined cash flow waterfall and other structural protections.

""There would not be any capping on those (the rating for the restricted groups) if other credit factors support higher than 'BBB-' rating,"" Fitch said. It also said in its report, ""cash flow generation from January 2023 to March 2024 will boost the liquidity of the groups.""

Most Adani group companies gained on Wednesday after a drop in the previous session following a report that said the conglomerate was seeking to renegotiate debt, which the group refuted.

But another sprawling Indian conglomerate—miner Vedanta Resources—is looking wobbly.

Market skittishness in the wake of the turmoil at Adani Group, which came under attack from short seller Hindenburg Research in late January, means that other indebted Indian companies—which otherwise might have muddled their way through the Federal Reserve hiking cycle—could increasingly find themselves under investors’ microscopes. A Vedanta Resources dollar bond due in May 2023 was yielding about 50% on Friday according to Refinitiv—about double the level at the end of January.

The fundamental problem is that London-headquartered Vedanta Resources, with several billion dollars of debt, is reliant on transfers from its Indian subsidiary Vedanta Ltd. That unit has its own large direct debts, and holds the lion’s share of the group’s actual assets.

View Full Image Refinitiv/WSJ

Moody’s downgraded the firm’s debt deeper into junk bond territory earlier in the month. The rating agency says it needs about $4 billion in cash to pay off debt and interest coming due over the financial year ending in March 2024.

The company hopes to pay with the help of chunky cash flows from its Indian subsidiaries, but their finances are under pressure too. And Indian politics could make some of those payments difficult to realize.

On Tuesday Mumbai-listed Vedanta Ltd. said it will hand out its fifth dividend of about $927 million for the current financial year ending this month. Vedanta Ltd., 70% owned by Vedanta Resources, has announced dividends of $4.6 billion in the last 12 months, more than double the fiscal year before. But the firm’s interim CFO resigned during the week. Local ratings agency CRISIL Ratings also downgraded its outlook on Vedanta Ltd. to negative from stable, citing possible higher leverage and lower financial flexibility because of big dividend payments to the parent.

Vedanta Ltd.’s unit Hindustan Zinc, partly owned by the government of India, also announced a fourth dividend for the current fiscal year of about $1.3 billion last week. And Hindustan Zinc has offered $3 billion to buy its parent’s international zinc assets, a deal the government has vehemently opposed.

The big cash payments are also coming at a time of moderating commodity prices. Moody’s expects Vedanta Ltd.’s consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) will be $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion during the 2024 fiscal year, down from $6.4 billion in fiscal 2022.

Meanwhile Vedanta Ltd. itself has $2.6 billion of its own debt maturing in the next 12 months. And while its net debt to Ebitda ratio is an acceptable 1.21, raising further debt might not be easy in the current environment.

Crisil says Vedanta Ltd. currently only has the cash to cover Vedanta Resources’ maturities for the first half of fiscal 2024. If Hindustan Zinc’s generous offer to purchase its parent’s international zinc assets falls through—a real possibility with India’s general elections looming—then Vendanta Ltd. may struggle to keep paying fat dividends and Vedanta Resources will be in a tight spot.

Even assuming that Vedanta Ltd. and London-based Vedanta Resources ultimately avoid repayment trouble, the saga won’t be without consequences.

Investec analyst Ritesh Shah says that minority Vedanta Ltd. shareholders—though receiving fabulous dividends—are losing out on future returns because the firm will probably be forced to keep capital expenditures weak in the coming months. That may be one reason the company trades at a relatively low forward earnings multiple of 6.05, compared with global peers Anglo American or Teck Resources which trade at about eight.

The Adani saga has been obscured in recent weeks by the even more dramatic runctions in the U.S. banking sector. That doesn’t mean there won’t be further tremors emerging from India.","A Vedanta Resources dollar bond due in May 2023 was yielding about 50% on Friday according to Refinitiv—about double the level at the end of January.

The impact of Adani Group on the overall market should be limited...,None,Adani Group stocks to go through a long phase of consolidation: Sandip Sabharwal,"""The impact of Adani Group on the overall market should be limited because the base case was always that they are unlikely to default and if they are unlikely to default then for the rest of the market the contagion should be limited,"" says Sandip Sabharwal , asksandipsabharwal.com.It is tough to say because when NASDAQ actually cracked a lot Indian IT stocks were relatively stable so does NASDAQ being stable actually indicate again an uptick in outsourcing. I think there is a lag. So my guess is that next one or two quarters will be quite tough for IT companies. Now good news and good prices all of us know do not come together so at some point of time within these quarters we will get into buy zone for IT companies but at this point of time I would still like to focus on domestic focus companies.For some it will be, for others it will not be and in many of these cases like the signings yesterday these orders were already announced earlier and it is just that first an order is announced and then it is actually signed and then gets implemented so I think so we should not be doing double counting in some of these orders.But that said overall it is a low volatility sort of sector in terms of performance but these are long gestation projects so for example many of the ship orders or frigate missile launch orders which were announced yesterday the delivery starts in 2026-27 etc and then goes on for a few years so it is not that everything is going to come now. These are very long gestation projects and as such the revenue is spread out.The impact of Adani Group on the overall market should be limited because the base case was always that they are unlikely to default and if they are unlikely to default then for the rest of the market the contagion should be limited. Now how the overall Adani Group will perform is something we need to see because stocks have fallen from the top but they are still not cheap because the rise was so abnormal that people think that because they are half the valuation they are cheap. Most of them are still not cheap. So I think they will need to go through a long phase of consolidation.I would think all of them are good to buy now. I would say risk reward is at worst case another 10% downside and potential upside of 25% over the next one year or so. So I think risk reward is favourable. These banks are well placed, balance sheets are strong, profit growth will be reasonable.That I cannot predict because I do not know what numbers will come out. But I think many of the auto stocks got beaten down after the monsoon prediction that monsoons will be bad, summers will be very hot and that might impact overall sentiment, rural income, inflation, dynamics, interest rates etc.So I think that is where the correction in many of these companies which are actually doing well started. Now we have not had a hot summer till now and monsoon is still a question mark how that will be. So I think those externalities are difficult to predict but valuation wise I think these companies have become more reasonable now and although consumer demand might be slow to recover but I think it will eventually recover and going into later part of this year we should see stronger growth. So four wheelers, autos I would still like to see and two wheelers I would still like to avoid.I do not buy many of these banks but that does not mean that they cannot rise up further. If the overall banking sector moves up, then they might also move up but challenges are more on the operational side because this year we would have seen the best of the reduced write-offs, increase in margins, etc. All of that will not go through from next year onwards. So, I think the results and everything are not going to be as great as what people think it would be.Because of the fact that the credit, one, the credit growth has been strong, it will moderate a bit but I think on the deposit side, many of these PSU Banks, the costing will go up substantially because they are losing market share in low-cost deposits and once the easy liquidity chase got over, I think that will be the challenge. So, I think the impact of that we will need to see.","So my guess is that next one or two quarters will be quite tough for IT companies.

In mid-March, Bangladesh started testing the transmission of electricity from a massive 1,600 MW coal-fired plant in neighbouring India that has stirred major controversy in both countries.

While the supply of electricity for commercial use from this plant is likely to begin next month, confusion and secrecy around the terms of the agreement and how much Bangladesh could be forced to pay have intensified discontent in the country.

Built by Adani Power Ltd – India’s largest private power company founded by Gautam Adani – the $1.7bn Godda plant in India’s Jharkhand state has drawn flak in Dhaka for the “lopsided nature” of the power purchase agreement (PPA) that a number of experts say has favoured the Indian multibillionaire on several fronts. Al Jazeera has reviewed a copy of the agreement.

Under the agreement, Dhaka will pay significantly higher prices – in comparison to what it pays for its other coal-based power – for lower-grade coal. That coal will be supplied from an Adani-owned mine in Australia to an Adani-owned port in India from where it will get shipped to the Godda plant, which is in a coal-mining state.

Apart from that, experts also point out that Bangladesh is not getting the benefit of the tax exemption which Adani Power Ltd got when its Godda plant was declared a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) – the exemption should have been passed on to Bangladesh.

In New Delhi, critics have questioned the whole point of the Modi government going the extra mile to ensure “multiple tax benefits” for a private coal plant that will supply electricity to another country at the cost of its own environment and people.

B D Rahmatullah, a former director general of Bangladesh’s power regulator put it bluntly.

“There are four stakeholders of this plant – people of these two countries, the Bangladesh government and Adani Power,” he told Al Jazeera, “From what I see, only one will be benefitted from it: Adani.”

“Unfortunately, it seems our government has no intention of revising or getting out of this electricity purchase arrangement despite the growing discontent surrounding it,” Rahmatullah added.

Hoopla after Hindenburg report

Even though the electricity deal between Adani and the Bangladesh government is nearly six years old, it didn’t create much of a storm – at least politically – for most of this time as its details were never made public. The deal was struck under a controversial Special Act of Bangladesh that allows the government to make unsolicited PPAs.

Analysts say Bangladesh opted for the electricity deal as it had major political implications for its ruling Awami League (AL) party at the time.

“It was not a secret to the AL that Adani was closely tied with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a business deal that favours Adani would ultimately bring political favour from Modi to AL government,” Saimum Parvez, research fellow of the department of political science of Vrije University in Brussels, told Al Jazeera.

“And AL needed that favour from India to secure political legitimacy. They are in power on the back of two severely controversial elections [including one in 2014] and they needed all the support from India, the regional superpower,” Parvez added.

He said the deal with Adani didn’t create much furore for a long time as the AL government successfully contained any sort of criticism with its firm grip on the opposition parties and muzzled the press with draconian laws.

But that started to change from mid-2022 onward, Parvez said, as the country started to feel the heat of inflation, price hikes, shrinking foreign reserves, and embezzlement of millions of dollars from a series of banks, leading to a rise in public discontent.

“After a long time, opposition political parties successfully arranged several massive protests in the latter half of 2022. And then the Hindenburg report was released in the beginning of this year,” said Parvez, giving them more ammunition for their protests.

In January, Adani, who was the world’s second-richest man just a few months ago, was thrown at the centre of a worldwide scandal when a bombshell report by a US-based short-seller named Hindenburg Research accused him of stock market manipulation and fraud. Within a few weeks, Adani lost more than $100bn of his wealth.

In Bangladesh, analysts as well as opposition political parties have seized on that to question the necessity of the power deal. Criticism over the deal was mounting even before the Hindenburg report on the back of reports in the Washington Post – which reported on its unfavourable terms for Bangladesh – and Bangladeshi news agency UNB, which said the country had tried to renegotiate in recent times.

The Indian conglomerate has denied Bangladesh did so. In an email to Al Jazeera, Roy Paul, associate vice president of Adani Group, said that the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) – the state-owned entity that purchases electricity on behalf of the government – has “never sought any revision in power purchase agreement with Adani Power”.

In Bangladesh, top government officials from both the BPDB and Power Ministry did not respond to Al Jazeera’s query whether Dhaka had indeed sought a revision of terms. One BPDB official who preferred to remain unnamed as he’s not authorised to speak to the media said, “We are instructed from the high-ups to remain completely tight-lipped about anything with the Adani deal.”

Nasrul Hamid, the country’s state minister for power and energy, declined to comment.

‘Designed to benefit Adani’

The groundwork for the deal with Adani’s Godda plant was laid during Narendra Modi’s first state visit to Bangladesh in 2015 when the country was already generating more than 12,000 MW of electricity against the peak demand of 8,177 MW.

At the time, the Bangladeshi economy was growing rapidly and it was projected that, by 2030, the country would need 34,000 MW to sustain its growth.

Two years later, the deal was inked, even though Bangladesh had a flurry of more favourable power deals – including coal-based ones in Payra, Banshkhali and Rampal – in the bag at that time. The projected electricity generation of those plants was enough to meet Bangladesh’s demand until 2025, BPDB reports said at the time.

The US-based Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), pointed out in its 2018 report, Adani Godda Power Project: Too expensive, too late and too risky for Bangladesh (PDF) that the project was “clearly designed to benefit Adani” and is, at least in part, “an attempt to prop up Adani Enterprises’ troubled Carmichael coal project in Australia”.

Simon Nicholas, the author of the IEEFA study, told Al Jazeera that the original plan for Godda was to use local coal mined in Jharkhand state but was later changed to use coal from Adani’s Carmichael coal mine in Australia, where the coal is high ash and low energy.

“BPDB was basically locked into a power purchase agreement that allows Adani to import coal into an Indian coal mining state from Australia and pass the full cost onto Bangladesh,” he said.

Conflicting information given by the BPDB and Adani Power about the price of coal for the plant has only deepened the controversy. Bangladeshi media reported, citing BPDB officials, that Adani Power asked $400 per metric tonne of coal for the Godda plant, a whopping 60 percent more than the average $250 Bangladesh usually pays for imported coal for its other power plants in Payra, Banskhali or Rampal.

Adani spokesperson Paul told Al Jazeera that they are not sure how the media came up with the $400 figure as the coal price chargeable by Adani Power would be $139 per metric tonne in March, the first month of its supplies.

Paul also said the electricity tariff from Godda will be $0.1363 per kilowatt hour (including a fixed capacity charge of $0.0424), and not $0.24 per kilowatt hour as reported by Bangladeshi media. A capacity charge is the base sum paid to a power plant even if no electricity is taken.

Al Jazeera couldn’t independently verify the company’s claims as it didn’t provide documentation of these tariffs. Several BPDB officials Al Jazeera contacted declined to comment on the conflicting information provided by them and Adani Power.

Al Jazeera did verify that the per-kilowatt-hour price at Bangladesh’s Rampal Power Plant is $0.1889 (including a capacity charge of $0.0485), while the price for the same at Banshkhali Power Plant is $0.1897 (including a capacity charge of $0.0460).

Mohammad A Arafat, founder and chairman of Suchinta Foundation, a think tank and a member of the central executive committee of Bangladesh’s ruling Awami League, told Al Jazeera that Bangladeshi media has published “many misleading reports” about electricity tariff and coal price of the Godda plant.

“Bangladesh is buying coal based on the standard international market price and getting electricity from Godda at a very competitive rate,” said Arafat, who is also a professor of strategic management and policy at the Canadian University of Bangladesh, a private university.

“Those who are criticising the plant are either spreading misinformation or lack the capacity to understand the very deal.”

Flawed deal

Shamsul Alam, energy adviser for the Consumer Association of Bangladesh (CAB) and a critic of the deal, says that, unlike the PPAs for Rampal and Banshkhali, which have a cap on the prices Bangladesh pays if the cost of coal skyrockets, the agreement with Godda has no cap.

“The sky is the limit,” Alam said.

“Now Adani Power says they are charging less than the other coal-based plants in Bangladesh but that is just for this month. BPDB confirmed just a month ago that Adani was charging quite an exorbitant price per metric tonne of coal.

“Maybe they are now asking for a reduced price in face of outcries in Bangladesh. But where lies protection against abnormal price hikes of coal in the agreement?” he asked.

Veteran Bangladeshi energy journalist Arifuzzaman Tuhin pointed out another major flaw of the Godda coal deal. As per the agreement, Adani Power will get the price of 555.43 grammes of coal for each unit of electricity production, more than the industry average of 493.48 grams. “Just because of this, Adani Power will rake in an extra half a billion US dollars per year from this plant,” he told Al Jazeera.

That apart, the agreement says that at least 34 percent of the plant’s annual electricity output must be taken and paid for by the BPDB, something which none of the other plants has in their PPAs.

“This is insane, considering the fact that Bangladesh is forced to pay this on the top of at least $450m per year which it will pay for the capacity charge of Godda,” Tuhin said.

As per the IEEFA report, Adani should have reduced Godda’s capacity charge for Bangladesh by at least 12 to 15 percent on the back of the tax benefits the power plant received in India, which will help the company save at least $1bn over 25 years.

“Adani Power didn’t bother to pass down the benefits of tax exemption and that means Bangladesh is bearing something which it is not supposed to bear,” Tuhin said.

CAB’s Alam said the agreement’s lopsidedness is evident in every section.

“Just consider the one [section] that talks about force majeure,” he said, which includes political events like a strike or war or change in the law. In the case of a force majeure where Adani Power is unable to supply power to Bangladesh, it will not be required to pay any damages even though BPDB will still have to pay the power company its capacity charges.

“Just tell me how this is justified?” Alam asked.","Bangladesh’s opposition has jumped on the recent controversy over the Indian tycoon to demand cancelling the power deal.

Moitra has been one of the main voices in the Opposition who has been demanding a JPC probe into the Adani row since the Hindenburg Research's report alleged stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens by the group. The Adani Group has denied the allegations.

“Adani shares tumble on @reuters report that group seeking time to pay ACC, Ambuja debt. Don’t have cash flows, don’t have credibility to access long term bond markets. All chickens coming home to roost!” Moitra said in her latest tweet.

Reuters report added that the group's flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, slid nearly 8% to a near four-week low, while Adani Ports tumbled 9.2%. ACC dropped 4.8% to its lowest since February 2021 and Ambuja Cement slipped 4.2%.

The group, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, has begun negotiations with lenders to extend the tenure of its $3 billion bridge loan to a period of five years or beyond from the existing 18 months, The Economic Times said on Tuesday, citing sources.

Adani refutes reports on debt repayment concerns

The Adani Group refuted the reports in separate statements on Tuesday, calling the claims “baseless speculation.” Later in the day, the company addressed The Ken report, saying it had paid off share-backed financing amounting to $2.15 billion and that the stock pledged for those facilities had been released.

Adani spokesman Jugeshinder Singh earlier tweeted that the report was a “deliberate misrepresentation.”

OpIndia,2023-03-30 14:47:12.184273,Who gave Gautam Adani land for Mundra port at 10 paise per sq meter in 1993? The answer will leave Rahul Gandhi shell-shocked,https://www.opindia.com/2023/03/gautam-adani-got-land-for-mundra-port-at-10-paise-per-sq-meter-in-1993-rahul-gandhi/,"Gautam Adani, the head of the Adani Group, has denied receiving any special favours from Narendra Modi during his reign as Prime Minister and his earlier stint...",2023-03-29 09:19:37+00:00,Gautam Adani had received land for Mundra Port at 10 paise per sq mtr in 1993,"While Rahul Gandhi and Congress have been using Adani as a stick to beat the Modi government and project them as guilty of cronyism, the history of the Adani Group’s first infrastructure project in Mundra in Gujarat will leave both the grand old party and the Gandhi scion in shock and perhaps stupefaction.

Even though the Gandhi scion keeps alleging that Modi is working at the behest of a few businessmen, with Adani being among them, the facts of the matter, especially in the rise of the Adani Group and its Mundra Port business, do not jibe with the allegations levelled by the former Wayanad MP.

Nevertheless, the attack against the Centre concerning Adani had intensified in the last few weeks, especially in the wake of the Hindenburg Report on Adani, which alleged that the group had indulged in stock manipulation and fraud to inflate its valuation. The attack escalated following the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Lok Sabha after a Surat Court convicted and sentenced him to 2 years of imprisonment for his racist remarks against a particular community. Gandhi had alleged that he was disqualified from the parliament because he dared to speak up on the supposed ties between PM Modi and Adani.

However, it is worth noting that it was not PM Modi or the BJP government that bestowed on Adani his first piece of land for the Mundra Port project. It was under the Chimanbhai Patel-led Congress government in 1993 that granted land at 10 paise per sq meter to Adani for his Mundra Port project.

Gautam Adani, the head of the Adani Group, has denied receiving any special favours from Narendra Modi during his reign as Prime Minister and his earlier stint as Gujarat CM. According to him, the Adani Group, which is valued at $8.7 billion and operates in ports and energy, started purchasing land near the coastal town of Mundra in Gujarat as early as 1993. However, it is worth noting that only 5,315 acres of the total 15,946-acre land bank were acquired during Modi’s tenure as Chief Minister.

Congress government led by Chimanbhai Patel granted the first piece of land to Adani for 10 paise per sq meter

In his interview published in 2014, Adani asserted that no farmland was utilised for the construction of the Mundra port. Only barren and desert-like land, he said, was selected for the development of infrastructure projects in Kutch at a time no one thought of investing in the region.

Adani utilised the land to construct India’s largest port, which handled a record-breaking 100 million tons of cargo in FY 2013-14, and the nation’s largest privately-owned coal power station. He stated that his group did not acquire the land at lower prices to sell it for a profit.

However, what’s fascinating is the price at which Adani secured vast tracts of land for building the Mundra Port. Gautam Adani received the land for Mundra Port in 4 parts, starting with the Chimanbhai Patel-led Congress government in Gujarat in March 1993. The Congress government had then granted Adani the land at a throwaway price of just 10 paise per square meter. He subsequently received additional plots of land under Shankersinh Vaghela in 1997, BJP governments led by Keshubhai Patel in 1995 and Narendra Modi in 2005.

“When we began acquiring land at Mundra in 1993, (Chief Minister) Chimanbhai Patel charged us 10 paise per square meter. (BJP government led by) Keshubhai Patel (in 1995) charged us Re 1 per sq mt and Shankersinh Vaghela (led Rashtriya Janata Party) in 1996-07, charged Rs 1.5 per sq mt. Under Mr Modi, we got some 5,000 acres of land at an average of Rs 15 per sq mt rate,” he had said.

Modi assumed the position of Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, and in 2006, during the tenure of the UPA government’s SEZ policy, Adani acquired his first piece of land under his leadership to establish a special economic zone (SEZ). Although the initial request was for 10,000 acres, Adani was only granted 5,000 acres.

Rahul Gandhi has long claimed that the land allotted to Adani was equivalent to Vadodara’s size, but the reality is starkly different than what the Gandhi scion would have us believe. The Adani Group had acquired 7,350 hectares of land, whereas Vadodara city has an area of 15,900 hectares.","It was under the Chimanbhai Patel-led Congress government in 1993 that granted land at 10 paise per sq meter to Adani for his Mundra Port project.

Besides NCP, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has also supported a court-monitored probe on the Adani issue.

Pawar said a probe by JPC may prove to be futile as the panel may comprise more members from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which enjoys a majority in Parliament. “In view of the present strength of BJP in Parliament, it would be more rational to accept the SC panel to probe the Adani issue,” Pawar said.

State Congress chief spokesperson Atul Londhe, however, insisted for a JPC probe. “Why is the ruling BJP scared of forming a JPC ?” he said.

As part of the nationwide ‘Jai Bharat Satyagraha’ launched by the Congress party against the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi as a Lok Sabha member, the frontal organisations of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) held a protest at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Gandhi Bhavan premises.

TPCC Minorities Dept Chairman Shaik Abdullah Sohail, OBC Cell Chairman Nuthi Srikanth, SC Cell Chairman Preetam and ST Cell Chairman Jagan Naik and other leaders participated in the protest.

Speaking on the occasion, Minorities Department Chairman Abdullah Sohail asserted that the BJP government had been shielding economic offenders like Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, and Mehul Choksi.

Jai Bharat Satyagraha

However, he claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi became infuriated when Rahul Gandhi began revealing the culprits and their links to the ruling party.

Sohail added that instead of addressing Rahul Gandhi’s questions regarding the Adani Group’s alleged ties to PM Modi, BJP leaders are creating a commotion and attempting to deflect attention.

Abdullah Sohail stated that the Modi government crossed a line when it issued a notice to Rahul Gandhi, demanding he vacates his official residence within 24 hours of his disqualification.

“Rahul Gandhi is a true crusader against corruption. He has been advocating for the people without fear of repercussions. Despite having had three Prime Ministers from their family, today, Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi do not own a home.

Now the BJP government has served an eviction notice to Rahul Gandhi, effectively attempting to render him homeless. By targeting Rahul Gandhi, the BJP is trying to conceal its alleged cronyism and corruption,” he explained.

OBC Department Chairman Nuthi Srikanth argued that it was absurd for the BJP to associate Rahul Gandhi’s speech issue with the OBCs.

“Lalit Modi and Nirav Modi do not belong to BC communities. Moreover, the BJP government, which is avoiding conducting a caste census, is now discussing OBCs. They are attempting to hide their illicit activities and corrupt allies behind the impoverished OBCs,” he said.

This amount is the first instalment of the construction cost.

It was stipulated that the State must hand over 25% of the construction cost of the breakwater, amounting to Rs 347 crore, before March 31. Owing to the financial crisis being faced by the State, its share of Rs 100 crore was paid after obtaining a loan from the Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC).

Dr Adeela Abdullah, Managing Director of the Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (VISL), said the rest of the amount could be paid this month.

The loan for paying the State's share was taken from the KFC after its efforts to obtain a loan from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) got delayed. The State is scheduled to pay Rs 100 crore each for Railway projects and acquisition of land. To meet expenses including this, the State had attempted to obtain a loan of Rs 550 crore from a consortium of cooperative banks.

The government expects a loan of Rs 3,400 crore from HUDCO. Of this, Rs 1,170 crore is for the Vizhinjam-Balaramapuram railway project. The Centre has to pay Rs 818 crore as viability gap funding and the State Rs 400 crore to the Adani Group.

Both ACC and Ambuja Cements, acquired last year by Gautam Adani, have their headquarters in Mumbai. However, with the acquisition by the Adani Group, the focal point is shifting to Gujarat and so are some of the key roles in the company. For instance, Ajay Kapur, Chief Executive Officer of the Cement Business of Adani Group, operates out of Ahmedabad, while other leadership roles, including the heads of divisions such as procurement, supply chain, health and safety have also been shifted out of Mumbai.

People reporting to such divisional chiefs either spend a substantial time outside Mumbai and Maharashtra or shuttle back and forth Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Sources said this situation is creating a strained atmosphere with a large number of people preferring to look for other options. Women having family responsibilities and those who are not willing to relocate have little option but to look for alternative employment opportunities.

Those who have not relocated are compelled to travel because their bosses are no longer sitting in Mumbai, said sources. There is a similar situation in some of the other locations, sources added.

The sources further said that competing firms in the industry, based in Mumbai, have been receiving calls for job vacancies as have companies belonging to other conglomerates in the city.

In response to queries sent by businessline, a spokesperson for the Adani group replied, “We do not comment on our employee related matters.”

Besides the issues related to relocation, there is a disquiet among employees due to the uncertainty triggered by corporate governance issues surrounding the group and intense scrutiny by stakeholders. There is also fear of job cuts as the group grapples with the huge debt on its balance sheet and is looking for ways to reduce and optimise costs.

The news filtering in from Ahmedabad, the seat of the Adani empire, has given rise to some uneasiness as sources said that the group is making no attempt to hold on to people who want to leave.

The two companies between them have an employee base of over 10,000 and Mumbai, being the headquarters, has a significant number of them. At the end of FY22, ACC had over 6,000 permanent employees on its rolls of which the management staff is about 60 percent, while the remaining staff were shop floor workers, deployed at its various plants and sites. Ambuja Cements has 4,700-odd employees with roughly 70 percent of them in the management cadre.","Employees of ACC and Ambuja Cements are out in the market looking for jobs with the new owner, the Adani Group, relocating significant roles to Ahmedabad, sources said.

The Adani-Hindenburg episode may be hot news but acts of shorting have age-old histories across the globe.,None,The long & short for SEBI – Learnings from Adani-Hindenburg fiasco,"– By Dr. Shakti Deb and Trisha Shreyashi

The Adani-Hindenburg episode may be hot news but acts of shorting have age-old histories across the globe. This fiasco catapulted the need to relook at the existing regulatory framework, the relevant causal factors, and the need for putting in place robust mechanisms to protect the investors must be looked into. It has projected the question of whether shorting is desirable for a healthy market or not, a question mulled over by the Supreme Court of India as well.

The pro-ban school argues that short-selling is fuelled by pessimism and draws profits only when the setbacks happen or the market crashes. This leads to massive disruption in stock prices which shakes investors’ confidence in the capital market and adds difficulties for firms in raising capital. Alternately, those against the ban argue that restriction over shorting carries the risk of inefficient market pricing of stocks and creates a cozy room for errant promoters to manipulate stock prices.

Short sellers are indeed fact-finding correspondents of capital markets who excavate worsening business entities, undue leverage managerial leverage, and corrupt management practices. They are beneficial intel, especially for an emerging economy where market controls like a hostile takeover, strong labor market, and investors’ activism are still on a developing curve.

However, there are instances of small short-sellers who attempt to distort the market based on rumors or ulterior personal interests. Shorting is not bothersome but the Adani crash resulted in losses of almost Rs 10 lakh cr. worth of investor money. Today’s India differs from the 1990s; the stock market is no longer just for the wealthy but a venue where a significant portion of the middle class also invests their life savings.

A 3-judge bench led by the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India at the apex court has heard the Public Interest Litigations in the instant matter. The Hon’ble SC has directed SEBI to probe into the matter on mainly three issues – (i) Violation of SCRA Rules, 1957 (ii) Failure to disclose related party transactions (iii) Manipulation of stock prices.

It also directed the constitution of an expert committee under Justice Abhay Sapre. The remit of the committee shall be essentially to provide an overall assessment of market factors, the extant regulatory mechanism, investigation of regulatory failure in the Adani-Hindenburg research matter and make suggestions to protect the interests of middle-class investors against sudden market volatility.

These pleas underscore the impact of the domino effect of Adani Group’s share price crash, resulting in devastating losses borne by retail investors and suicides in some cases in addition to adversely impacting the state-owned and private lenders. Thus, this case has propelled the question of whether modification of certain statutory laws is required and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure that the investors are protected.

Extant Framework: SEBI has plenary powers under Section 11 (1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, and Section 19 of the Depositories Act, 1996, to regulate the shorting of securities in the manner necessary and apposite to the investors’ protection and promotion of the development of, and to regulate the securities market. Presently, the SEBI has placed measures to secure the investor interests so that they have the knowledge of financial markets, investment methodology, and redressal of grievances. It has adopted a mandatory continuous disclosure-based regulatory framework for all issuers and intermediaries via screen-based trading, dematerialization, T+1 rolling settlement, etc.

Further, SEBI has prescribed the laws governing short-selling and securities borrowing and lending practices in line with the Securities Market Advisory Committee recommendation. The existing regulatory framework governing shorts has been prescribed by (i) a Broad framework for short selling and (ii) a Broad framework for securities lending and borrowing.

The framework for short selling allows trading of securities in the F & O segment to be eligible for shorting. This is driven by disclosing order placement intended as a short sale. The second framework obligates retail and institutional investors to disclose whether the transaction is a short sale at the time of placement of the order and demonstrate their ability to borrow to the satisfaction of the broker and data on a scrip-wise short position to the stock exchanges.

SEBI deems the market infrastructure institutions as the first-stage regulators. The stock exchanges are required to move extremely volatile scrips to additional surveillance measures (ASM), which signals the need for increased caution to be exercised by investors and due diligence by market participants who intend to deal with securities placed under ASM.

In the instant matter, NSE has placed Adani Enterprises under the ASM framework. However, this framework is triggered after price and volume volatility conditions are met, which might still be disconcerting for small and retail investors.

SEBI has implemented a one-stop solution for all investor issues, the SEBI Complaints Redress System (SCORES). It facilitates investor assistance, adjudication, prosecution, arbitration, progress on inquiry and action taken, directions, and compensation. It is mandatory for stock exchanges to establish investor services cells for the settlement of grievances, called the Investor Grievance Redressal Committee (IGRC). It acts as the nodal point to resolve the dispute by way of conciliation, failing which the dispute is referred to arbitration. Finally, all unresolved disputes reach the Office of Investor Assistance & Education. It is imperative to mention the exemplary penalty regime and powers the watchdog exercises.

However, this redressal mechanism works post-facto. The extant regime allows investors to seek gratification in penalties imposed upon the defaulter rather than obtaining a refund, especially in market manipulation matters. This leaves the middle class still reeling from the loss of their life savings.

Despite said regulatory framework, billions were already wiped off the stock market causing losses to investors due to substantial stock off-load in the stock market, before SEBI stepped in. It is necessary to determine whether the Hindenburg report was aimed at uncovering the wrongdoings of business organizations for the general benefit or for the personal benefit to attack a particular business organization with ulterior motives to derail their growth or to attach the corporate world of a country to derail the growth of the economy. The present episode of Adani-Hindenburg calls for a proactive regulatory response, not a reactive one.

Possible regulatory refit on short-selling: The market regulator may consider the imposition of an ad-hoc embargo on disclosure of research reports in the public domain and shorting until the report gets substantiated. Such proscription was imposed by the US market regulator Securities and Exchange Commission through an emergency order as a response to market developments which included likely superfluous or fake price movements driven by baseless rumours.

Additionally, there is also scope for improvement of the existing framework on shorts in terms of enhanced disclosure. This would act as a checkpoint for protection of retail investor interests and sustain market stability. Any companies listed in India and cross-listed in overseas jurisdictions and whose issued stocks or securities are subjected to such short positions shall carry the obligation to report the short positions concerning their issued stocks or securities on a monthly basis. This will facilitate the investors to be informed about such short positions and, accordingly, may react in terms of stock prices. The data on such short positions may easily be extracted from the stock exchange’s public information domain.
