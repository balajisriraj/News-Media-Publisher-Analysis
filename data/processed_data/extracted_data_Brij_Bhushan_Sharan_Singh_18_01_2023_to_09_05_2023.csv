Nagar in Uttar Pradesh's Gonda district and it was BJP Lok Sabha member and president of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh,...",2023-01-21 14:47:21+05:30,Why it won't be easy for BJP to act against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh,"On Saturday, the senior National Open Ranking Wrestling Tournament began at Nandini Nagar in Uttar Pradesh's Gonda district and it was BJP Lok Sabha member and president of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who was supposed to have stepped aside until the allegations of ''sexual assault'' of female wrestlers were probed by an oversight committee, inaugurated the championship.

Singh was on the stage along with a couple of local BJP legislators and office bearers of the WFI and oversaw the arrangements of the tournament almost undeterred by the turn of events in Delhi apparently hinting that he was not bothered by the allegations and also that he did not expect his party to favour action against him.

BJP leaders here also, preferring anonymity, said that it would not be 'easy' to act against the firebrand leader, who was known to speak his mind even if it was against the party leadership or the BJP government in the state.

He had sharply criticised his own government, when floods hit several eastern and central districts in the state, including Gonda, Baharaich, Ayodhya and some others. ''The people have been left on the mercy of the god,'' he had then remarked, criticising the state government for not being able to provide succor to the flood-affected people.

''Singh is not originally a BJP worker.....he does not belong to the party cadre.....he has his own support base in Gonda, Baharaich, Balrampur, Shravasti and Ayodhya districts and is not dependent on us to win elections,'' said a UP BJP leader while speaking to DH here on Saturday.

Incidentally, Singh, who currently is an MP from Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat in Baharaich district, had earlier represented Balrampur and Gonda LS seats as well. He had also got his wife Ketki Singh elected to Lok Sabha when he was in jail under TADA in 1996. His son Prateek Vardhan Singh is also an MLA.

Sources in the BJP said that Singh was not the kind of person who would take any action against him in his stride. That he had earlier been with other parties and might not hesitate to ditch the saffron party made it even harder for the party to act against him.

''The next Lok Sabha polls are not very far away and we can not afford to lose a leader like him (Singh),'' the BJP leader added.","He had sharply criticised his own government, when floods hit several eastern and central districts in the state, including Gonda, Baharaich, Ayodhya and some others.

The Indian Express,,How ‘shaktishaali’ Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has ducked mud so far,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/brij-bhushan-sharan-singh-sexual-harassment-allegation-wrestlers-8393282/,"In 1996, when he did not contest, the party gave a ticket to his wife Ketaki Devi Singh, and she too won. A constant presence at wrestling tournaments, be it...",2023-01-20 10:30:37+05:30,How ‘shaktishaali’ Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has ducked mud so far,"In the wrestling arena or out of it, fighting as a candidate of the BJP or the Samajwadi Party, in the contest as candidate or with his wife as proxy, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has rarely lost a bout. But that streak might end now, with the growing allegations of sexual harassment against him by women wrestlers, who are demanding Singh’s resignation as the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI).

A wrestler who tumbled into politics via the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, and who continues to face a case in the Babri Masjid demolition, Singh, 66, has kept his feet planted on the ground courtesy the image of a “dabangg” leader – or a “shaktishaali (powerful)” one, as he likes calling himself — who doesn’t need the BJP as much as the BJP needs him in at least half-a-dozen districts around his native Gonda in Uttar Pradesh.

Singh is six-term MP (once from the SP), who has represented Gonda, Balrampur and now moved onto Kaiserganj, while his son Prateek Bhushan is into his second term as MLA from Gonda Sadar.

This formidable record also explains why despite several scraps with the party, including the government of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, there has been no attempt to touch his 10-year tenure as the WFI president and as vice-president of the United World Wrestling-Asia.

Local leaders talk about the grand celebrations he holds every year on his birthday on January 8, where students shortlisted via a talent search examination are rewarded with motorcycles, Scooty and cash. This year, the event in Gonda and adjoining districts such as Lucknow, Ayodhya, Bahraich, Shrawasti, Balrampur and Barabanki saw the participation of Union Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary.

BJP leaders also mention the goodwill Brij Bhushan Singh has earned due to his active association with more than 50 educational institutions, including engineering, pharmacy, education and law, that that he helped set up in Bahraich, Gonda, Balrampur, Ayodhya and Shrawasti districts.

“He has developed an empire in these districts through his clout. He gives a fee waiver to those students who are unable to pay. So, if he wins elections, it is both because of his clout and goodwill,” says a BJP leader from Gonda.

At the same time, BJP leaders say, the party has kept its distance by not giving him any position within the organisation and Union government despite his repeated poll wins. His own team of workers look after his constituency including day-to-day issues that might come up.

“Singh only takes the symbol of the party. He wins elections on his own,” says another party leader.

The confidence means Singh has got away with incidents such as his criticism of the Adityanath government during the floods in the state in October last year. He accused the administration of being ill-prepared, not doing enough for relief, and said people had been left “bhagwan bharose (to the mercy of god)”. Singh also said that the existing government did not tolerate criticism and took it personally.

While the Opposition raised the remarks to attack the Adityanath government, Singh did not earn any rebuke from the BJP.

He has praised SP leader Azam Khan, one of the BJP’s biggest bugbears in the state, as “a mass leader”, and threatened Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray against visiting Ayodhya till he had apologised publicly for “humiliating” north Indians in Mumbai. The BJP had been courting the MNS leader as an ally at the time of topsy-turvy politics in Maharashtra.

In private, the BJP had dismissed Singh’s remarks as publicity stunts.

It was due to his association with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and his influence in the areas around Ayodhya that Singh initially came to the notice of the BJP. The party first fielded him from the Gonda Lok Sabha seat in 1991. He won, and never looked back. In 1996, when he did not contest, the party gave a ticket to his wife Ketaki Devi Singh, and she too won.

A constant presence at wrestling tournaments, be it national or international, senior or junior, Singh can be spotted with a microphone in hand, overseeing bouts, often shouting out instructions to referees, stopping and starting bouts and, at times, even throwing the rule book at judges. When he can’t be there, he is known to “monitor the proceedings virtually”.

Whatever comes of the serious allegations Singh is now facing, that is almost certain to change.","So, if he wins elections, it is both because of his clout and goodwill,” says a BJP leader from Gonda.

He has admitted to a murder on video and described himself as a “shaktishaali” (powerful wrestler) in the past.

Speaking to ThePrint, some referred to him a ‘bahubali’ (strong-armed), and ‘gundo ka gunda’ (gangster of gangsters).

Up until yesterday, the President of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), Singh was known as a true reformer and strongman for the sport in the country.

Now, ace wrestlers — including Olympic medalists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik — have branded him a ‘predator’ and accused him of ‘sexual assault’ and aiding sexual harassment of female wrestlers.

A history sheeter

Singh is not new to controversy. He was arrested in the mid-1990s under Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for allegedly helping associates of gangster Dawood Ibrahim and spent several months in Tihar jail.

According to his election affidavit, he has four pending cases against him. Charges against him include causing voluntary harm to public servant (section 332 of the Indian Penal Code, or IPC), robbery (section 392), attempt to murder (section 307) and illegal payments in connection with an election (section 171 H).

In 2004, after shifting to Balrampur, Singh was replaced by Ghanshyam Shukla by the BJP as the party’s candidate from Gonda. Shukla was killed in a road accident which, some alleged, was actually “murder”. In an interview to Scroll.in, he said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had called and said “Marwaa diyaa (you had him killed)”.

A six-time MP from Gonda, Kaiserganj and Balrampur constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, Singh is currently serving as MP from Kaiserganj.

In his younger days he was reportedly a motorcycle thief, and even part of a liquor mafia in the 1980s.

He was also involved in a gunfight in 1993 and was acquitted by a local Gonda court in December last year in the case. He had been accused of attempting to murder Vinod Kumar Singh, also known as Pandit Singh, a former minister who was once friends with Singh.

A law graduate, Singh did his LLB from Dr RML Avadh University, Faizabad, in 1985 and currently his entire family is involved in politics. His wife Ketki Devi Singh is the president of Gonda Zila Panchayat and his son, Prateek Bhushan Singh, is an MLA from Gonda Sadar seat.

In 2004, Brij Bhushan’s 22-year-old son Shakti Singh had allegedly shot himself at their ancestral home in Nawabganj. In a note found, he had reportedly blamed his father for being selfish and never looking after him or his siblings: “You were never a good father. You never cared for your children, and only ever cared about yourself. Our future looks dark. There’s no reason why I should stay alive.”

The netaji of wrestling

Members of India’s wrestling fraternity say Singh is not only a “mafia don” but the “don of all mafia dons” in Uttar Pradesh.

“I hate mafias. I make videos against gangster culture regularly. But Sharan Singh has been the gunda that wrestling needs. Without him, it would be very difficult to discipline wrestlers or keep them in line,” former Sports Authority of India coach Ajit Singh told ThePrint over the phone. “What he has done for wrestling is unparalleled,” he added.

Singh was a wrestler during his school days and, since early days of his politics, has been championing the cause of the sport in Uttar Pradesh, once the mecca of the sport in the country. Singh’s grip over the sport in India comes mainly from his efforts to organise dangals (bouts) in the area using generous sums of money.

“Netaji has organised junior and national championships under his watch multiple times. Before mat wrestling came into vogue, he used to organise dangals at his own expense,” said Amar Kishore Kashyap, BJP president of Gonda district.

A profile in The Indian Express notes how Brij Bhushan used to actively participate in local tournaments, suspending referees and reigning supreme as the ultimate judge. According to the report, he still runs the show at dangals and had even suspended a railways coach for being “too animated” on the sidelines in 2022.

Players reportedly used to touch his feet and seek blessings before playing bouts at national championships.

Somvir Rathee, a wrestler who has joined the protests against Singh, however thinks the politician is out there to harm wrestling more than he is there for love of the game. “Anyone who even enters the akhada once in their life starts calling himself a pehelwaan. He knows nothing about the sport,” Rathee told ThePrint.

The young wrestler says that not only has Singh exercised control over the WFI as president of the body for almost a decade and a half — elected unopposed — he also controls other federations via his family. “Bihar wrestling federation is headed by his son-in-law, while his son controls the Uttar Pradesh federation,” alleged Rathee.

ThePrint couldn’t independently confirm these claims.

Rathee also said that Singh tends to “swear a lot” and is often rude. Singh’s short temper and lack of respect for players can be seen in a video clip of him slapping a wrestler going viral.

“His actions have made wrestlers indulge in politics. Should we play rajneeti–rajneeti (politics) or wrestle?” asked Rathee.

As per Singh’s election affidavit, three of the cases against him are pending in Allahabad court and one in a Lucknow court. As per record, out of four pending cases, charges were framed against him in two cases and one of the cases includes charges of attempt to murder and under the Arms Act.

However, Singh, who is facing allegations of sexual harassment as WFI chief, has been acquitted in over 30 criminal cases, some of them registered even before his political journey began.

According to the history sheet of the 65-year-old Singh accessed by IANS, there were a total of 38 criminal cases against him registered in Ayodhya, Nawabganj, Faizabad, and Delhi.

“A total of 17 cases were registered in Ayodhya, 12 in Faizabad, 8 in Nawabganj and one in Delhi. The cases were registered under several sections of IPC which even included murder, attempt to murder, and under the UP Gangsters Act, Arms Act among others,” according to the history sheet.

Singh was booked four times under UP Gangster Act till 1993.

On December 20, 2022, he was acquitted by an MP-MLA court in Gonda district of all charges in a 29-year-old case related to the attack on former minister in the Samajwadi Party government Vinod Kumar Singh alias Pandit Singh in 1993.

The six-time MP from Gonda, Kaiserganj and Balrampur constituencies in Uttar Pradesh was once also charged under Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act.

He was also arrested along with senior BJP leaders L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and others after demolition of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. He was acquitted in the matter by the court in 2020.

There were even controversies in the election of WFI President in 2012. Brij Bhushan had defeated Deepender Singh Hooda, son of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupender Singh Hooda in a re-election.

Olympian wrestlers Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat and other top Indian grapplers are protesting against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) at the Jantar Mantar in the national capital after Vinesh levelled serious allegations of sexual harassment of female wrestlers against the sports body’s coaches and President.

Vinesh had alleged that she was subjected to mental harassment by Singh.

Last year, the WFI President slapped a wrestler on stage for asking him questions, the video of which went viral on social media.","As per Singh’s election affidavit, three of the cases against him are pending in Allahabad court and one in a Lucknow court.

Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president and Lok Sabha MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has accused of sexually harassing top grapplers, while a woman coach from Haryana had recently lodged sexual harassment complaint against Sandeep Singh.

""In Haryana and in Delhi, BJP leaders (Sandeep Singh and Brij Bhushan) are not ready to leave their posts. When the accused continue to hold their posts, how will a fair investigation take place,"" Dhanda told reporters here.

Sandeep Singh had given up his Sports Department portfolio after the woman coach lodged a police complaint, but he continues to be Minister in the M L Khattar government holding the charge of Printing and Stationery Departments.

When these medallists win Olympic and other medals, they are praised, but when they are telling the nation what they have faced, the BJP leaders are raising questions, he said.

Dhanda said if the BJP fails to take action against the two, people of Haryana will not welcome Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his proposed visit to Gohana in Sonipat later this month.

""If daughters of Haryana are harassed, if they are insulted like this and if the BJP does not take any action in Sandeep Singh or Brij Bhushan cases, then people of Haryana will not welcome but oppose Amit Shah during his visit. We want to warn them,"" said Dhanda.

Shah is scheduled to address a public meeting in Gohana, Sonipat on January 29.

Dhanda said Sandeep Singh should have been sacked immediately after a complaint was lodged against him.

But he also continues to be the president of the Haryana Olympic Association, so under these circumstances how could a fair probe be expected, the AAP leader said.

Sitting beside Vinesh, Tokyo Olympics bronze...",None,"WFI President has sexually exploited women wrestlers, I have received death threats: Vinesh Phogat","In a startling revelation, a crying Vinesh Phogat on Wednesday alleged that Wresting Federation of India (WFI) President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has been sexually exploiting women wrestlers for many years, a charge vehemently rejected by the sports administrator and BJP MP.

Vinesh, who has been at loggerheads with WFI since the Tokyo Olympic Games, also claimed that several coaches at the national camp in Lucknow have also exploited women wrestlers, adding that there are a few women at the camp who approach wresters at the behest of the WFI President.

The 28-year-old though clarified that she herself never faced such exploitation but claimed that ""one victim"" was present at the 'dharna' they began at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday.

Vinesh also claimed that she had received death threats at the behest of WFI President from officials close to him because she dared to draw Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to several issues plaguing Indian wrestling when she met him after the Tokyo Games.

""I know at least 10-20 women wrestlers who have told me about the sexual exploitation they faced at the hands of (the) WFI President. They told me their stories. I can't take their names now but I can definitely reveal the names if we get to meet the Prime Minister and the Home Minister of the country,"" Vinesh said addressing the media after staging a four-hour dharna at Jantar Mantar.

""I have received death threats from people who are close to the WFI President. If anything happens to any of us sitting here, only the WFI President will be responsible."" Rio Olympics medallist Sakshi Malik, world championship medallist Sarita Mor, Sangeeta Phogat, Anshu Malik, Sonam Malik, Satyawart Malik, Jitender Kinha, Amit Dhankar and CWG medallist Sumit Malik were among 30 wrestlers who assembled at the famous protest site.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, 66, was elected President of WFI for a third consecutive term in February 2019.

Sitting beside Vinesh, Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia said the federation is being run in an arbitrary manner and they will not compete in any international competition unless the WFI President, who is no less than a ""dictator"", is removed.

""Our fight is not against the government or the Sports Authority of India (SAI). This is against WFI. 'Yeh ab aar paar ki ladai hai' (It's a fight to the finish). We will continue this protest until WFI President is removed,"" Bajrang told PTI.

""We will not compete in any international competition until the WFI President is removed. This is a fight to save Indian wrestling. While we are denied help and support of foreign coaches, the President has hired a foreign coach for his own academy in Gonda,"" Punia later said while addressing the media.

""He uses abusive language against wrestlers, we can even show you videos of that."" In December 2021, the WFI President had slapped an overage wrestler during the under-15 national championship when he insisted on competing after being disqualified.

The sitting BJP MP from Kaiserganj in Uttar Pradesh rejected all the charges against him and refused to quit his post.

""There is no truth in any of the allegations. Why should I quit? Even if one woman wrestler comes and proves the sexual harassment charge, I am ready to be hanged. There is an industrialist behind it (conspiracy),"" said the 66-year-old WFI President.

""There can be an investigation by the CBI or police. There is no dictatorship. These same wrestlers had met me a week back and did not say anything,"" he added.

Responding to the allegation of death threats given to Vinesh on his behalf, Brij Bhushan said, ""Why Vinesh did not talk to me or approached the police at that time? Why did she not meet the PM or the Sports Minister? Why is she saying this now."" The WFI boss indicated that the new policy and the rules they have introduced are perhaps causing a bit of discomfort to the wrestlers and that's why the protest.

He said the wrestlers are being asked to compete in the National Championships and appear in trials for fair selection, and there is nothing wrong in it.

""Different states host Nationals and all want the country's best athletes to compete. None of these wrestlers has competed in the Nationals. We have made it clear that only those athletes who compete and win at the National Championship will be selected for the National camp.

""The state of Haryana has been the pride of the country but we want to take wrestling to other states also. So we stopped the arrangements of states sending multiple teams at the Nationals.

""States like Bihar, Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram are weak and we need to promote the game there. So we introduced National Open Championships apart from the regular Nationals and there also Haryana claimed 61 per cent of the medals.

Vinesh said she is labelled an indisciplined athlete because she dares to speak her mind.

""I am being tortured every day."" Asked why they did not raise the issued before, Vinesh said, ""These are powerful, influential people. We could not muster courage. Now we were not left with any option. 'Ab paani sar se paar ho raha hai' (the limit has been reached). We have to think about the next generation of players as well."" Adding to it, Bajrang said, ""We are approaching the end of our careers. For how long will we play? 2024, 2026 or maybe 2028 but it is a question of the entire wrestling fraternity."" It may be recalled that the WFI, while taking disciplinary action against Vinesh for not wearing the official singlet during the Tokyo Games, had banned her but later lifted it after receiving a written apology from the athlete.

Vinesh said she did not wear that singlet because it was ""zero quality."" Explaining his position, the WFI President said that they were facing action from the International Olympic Committee for flouting the rules and he had to take action against Vinesh out of compulsion because he did not want a ban on India.

Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by The Telegraph Online staff and has been published from a syndicated feed.","""I know at least 10-20 women wrestlers who have told me about the sexual exploitation they faced at the hands of (the) WFI President.

The government-appointed Committee will also run the day-to-day affairs of WFI for the next one month.

The other members of the panel are Olympic medallist wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former badminton player and Mission Olympic Cell member Trupti Murgunde, ex-TOPS CEO Rajesh Rajagopalan and former SAI executive director - teams - Radhika Sreeman.

Earlier, Dutt had publicly come out in support of Singh, who is a six-time MP with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with Mary Kom also a nominated MP by the BJP.

The announcement of the panel was made by Sports Minister Anurag Thakur on Monday. Thakur had decided to form the Committee on Saturday following a three-day sit-in protest by some of the country's top wrestlers including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya against WFI and Singh. Singh was accused of sexually harassing women wrestlers and working like a dictator.

""The WFI president will not discharge his duties and stay away from day-to-day affairs of WFI. The day-to-day working of WFI will be looked after by the Oversight Committee till their mandated duration and it will also probe the serious allegations against WFI and its chief,"" said Thakur.

""In the next one month, this committee will probe the sexual allegations and other charges after talking to all parties and submit its report. Till then all the day-to-day decisions and workings of WFI will be taken care of by this committee,"" he added.

Both Mary Kom and Yogeshwar Dutt are also part of the the seven-member committee formed by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to probe the allegations of sexual harassment and corruption against the WFI chief. The IOA panel also includes archer Dola Banerjee and Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWLF) president and IOA treasurer Sahdev Yadav. The other members of the IOA committee are two advocates -- Talish Ray and Shlok Chandra -- besides former shuttler and IOA joint secretary Alaknanda Ashok, who is its vice chairperson.

Earlier, the Sports Ministry directed the WFI to suspend all ongoing activities owing to the various allegations against the sports body and its president. It included the Ranking Tournament in Gonda, UP, the federation president Singh's stronghold.

The ministry on Saturday also suspended WFI's assistant secretary Vinod Tomar 'with immediate effect', a fallout of allegations of sexual harassment and corruption against the sports body's chief.

However, the WFI rejected the allegations in their reply to the Sports Ministry, claiming the charges were ""motivated, biased, unfounded, untrue and false."" It also claimed that vested interests were behind the charges, noting the timing of the protest with elections in the fray: ""It would also be worth drawing attention that even the next election of WFI is due in near future of 2023... that the protest is not in the best interest of the wrestlers, it has some personal as well as hidden agenda to dislodge the current management of WFI.""","Boxing great MC Mary Kom will lead a five-member 'Oversight Committee' that will probe sexual harassment charges against Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

While sharing this video as a recent incident, people on social media claimed that Brij Bhushan Sharan, who has been accused of sexual harassment, slapped a wrestler on stage for asking questions.

This comes after star wrestlers Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, and others staged a protest at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar, accusing WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh of sexual harassment. Phogat also claimed that she was subject to mental harassment by the WFI boss, adding that she had contemplated suicide. Sports Minister Anurag Thakur addressed a press briefing and informed that a committee will be set up to investigate the allegations, and till then, Brij Bhushan Singh will not serve as WFI chief.

It is being widely shared on Facebook and Twitter with the same claim.

Claim:

WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan slapped a wrestler on stage for asking questions.

Fact Check:

The Logical Indian Fact-Check team verified the viral claim and found it misleading. The viral video is from 2021.

During the initial investigation, we did a reverse image search using the InVid tool, which led us to a report of NDTV dated December 18, 2021, in which stills of viral video can be seen. The report's title reads, ""Video Shows BJP MP Slapping Wrestler On Stage At Sports Event."" According to the report, the viral incident took place during Under-15 National Wrestling Championship, which was held at Khelgaon, Ranchi. The wrestler was from Uttar Pradesh and was not allowed to participate in the wrestling event for being over-aged. However, he kept insisting MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to allow him to participate in the U-15 category, to which the MP lost his temper and slapped the wrestler.

According to a report in The Times Of India, MP later defended his action by saying it was a case of age fraud. ""No one will tolerate indiscipline, and if the wrestler would have participated in the competition despite his overage, then it would have left a bad impression on other wrestlers"", Brij Bhushan Singh told media.

Later, many wrestlers from other states, including Uttar Pradesh, protested against the action of the WFI president and demanded an apology. Jharkhand Wrestling association president Bholanath Singh intervened and resolved the matter.

Other media outlets like BBC, The Hindu, and Hindustan had also reported the same.

Our investigation shows that the viral video is from December 2021, when WFI president Brij Bhushan Singh slapped a wrestler during the U-15 National Wrestling Championship tournament in Ranchi. It has nothing to do with the recent controversy, and hence, the viral claim is misleading.

Brij Bhushan is a six-time BJP MP, who also had a stint with the Samajwadi Party, currently representing Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj in the Lok Sabha. He is accused of allegedly sexually harassing players and misappropriating funds. Charges of sexual harassment were levelled against WFI coaches too. The protest includes leading names in the world of Indian wrestling, such as Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Sangita Phogat.

The WFI has rejected all allegations. Last week, after meeting with protesters, union minister Anurag Thakur said an oversight committee will investigate the allegations and submit its report in four weeks.

Meanwhile, Thakur said Brij Bhushan will cooperate with the investigation and “step aside” in the interim period.

The wrestlers subsequently ended their three-day protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar. They’re all well-aware of the consequences of speaking out, and hope the government will take action.

“We can lose our lives for saying all this,” Vinesh Phogat said on January 18 at Jantar Mantar. “If anything happens to us, the president will be responsible for it.” She said she’d flagged their issues with prime minister Narendra Modi after the Tokyo Olympics last year and has subsequently received “death threats”.

As she spoke, a sports journalist at the venue commented, “Now Singh will have to resign.”

But will he?

A chequered past

Brij Bhushan has been president of the WFI since 2011. His children are also in the public eye. His son Prateek Bhushan Singh is a BJP MLA from Gonda; his other son Karan Bhushan Singh is vice-president of the WFI.

The protesters told journalists they hadn’t spoken up earlier because of fear.

Perhaps there’s reason to fear him. According to his election affidavit, Brij Bhushan has four pending cases against him, while he’s reportedly been acquitted in “over 30 criminal cases”, though others peg it at “four dozen”. He’s called himself a baahubali who isn’t afraid of going to jail.

Crucially, Brij Bhushan has admitted on video that he’s killed someone. This was in connection with the murder of Ravindra Singh, the brother of Samajwadi Party leader Vinod Kumar Singh, aka Pandit Singh, who once held sway over Gonda and Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh.

In the interview, Brij Bhushan said he shot the man who had killed Ravindra. “I pushed the man who shot Ravindra and shot him dead,” he said .

A journalist with a Gonda newspaper told Newslaundry that Brij Bhushan and Pandit had started their political journeys around the same time.

“Their region of political influence was also the same,” said the journalist, who has reported on UP politics for over 20 years. “After Ravindra’s death, their enmity increased. Pandit Singh believed his brother was killed because he was with Brij Bhushan.” Pandit Singh died of Covid-related complications in 2021.

Born in Gonda, Brij Bhushan’s interest in politics began as a college student in the 1970s. “His family supported the Congress but he was inclined towards the BJP from the beginning,” the journalist said. “His fortunes took a turn when LK Advani came to Gonda during the Ram Mandir rath yatra.”

This was in 1990. According to the journalist, Brij Bhushan was co-opted to drive a “chariot” as part of the yatra after the original driver fell ill. “This brought him closer to Advani. Later, he got a party ticket and his political journey began.”

This story might be the stuff of legends, though, because another journalist alleged that Brij Bhushan got closer to BJP leaders only during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. He had participated in the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 and had a case filed against him. He was acquitted in 2020.

A journalist from Ayodhya said Brij Bhushan has “so many” cases filed against him that he’s called dabanng. In December 2021, he slapped a wrestler on-stage during an event in Ranchi after he “lost his cool”. “No leader with decent or dignified conduct would have done that,” the journalist said.

A strongman with a ‘mini-economy’ in UP

As his political clout grew, Brij Bhushan developed his own mini-economy in Uttar Pradesh. Sources told Newslaundry he owns multiple colleges in the districts of Gonda, Basti, Bahraich and Ayodhya – some put the number at over 50. Students are purportedly “passed” if they pay a “lump sum amount”.

A journalist also alleged that Brij Bhushan “used his influence” to mine sand from the Sarayu and Ghaghra rivers, and has interests in liquor contracts and coal. “He has a huge mining business. He is full of bombast. Sometimes, he considers himself above the party because he won the MP seat six times consecutively. He thinks that whether or not the party gives him a ticket, he will become an MP.”

He also dabbles in real estate. “People had to sell their land against their will,” the Ayodhya journalist alleged. “After he built the Nandini Nagar Mahavidyalaya in Nawabganj, it expanded by 1-1.5 km...It is said the boundary of the college was never constructed! The expansion that started 30 years ago continues to this day.”

The turning point in Brij Bhushan’s tryst with controversy came in 1996, when he was accused of sheltering associates of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. He was booked under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act and jailed. During his stint in prison, Atal Bihari Vajpayee allegedly wrote to him , asking him to take courage and “remember Savarkarji who was sentenced to life imprisonment”.

“Later on, the CBI acquitted him,” said a senior journalist from Gonda. “In most allegations against him, he got bail due to lack of evidence. But it can’t be said that he’s beyond reproach. He did a lot of illegal work but survived due to political protection. Think about it, Vajpayee wrote a letter to the person accused of supporting Dawood Ibrahim. What political protection can be bigger than that?”

While he was in jail in 1996, the BJP gave his wife Ketki Devi Singh a party ticket and she won by a margin of 70,000 votes.

In 2009, Brij Bhushan parted ways with the BJP and joined the SP. He returned home to the BJP before Modi’s victory in 2014.

Yet Brij Bhushan’s politics often contradict his party’s. In 2009, when he was a BJP MP, he voted in favour of the Congress-led UPA government in the nuclear treaty. As reported by Indian Express , he’s previously called Baba Ramdev the “king of adulterators” and criticised the Adityanath government’s preparedness for floods, saying they left the public to “bhagwan bharose”, the mercy of god.

He even fielded his own favourite candidates against BJP candidates. In 2017, during an event with Adityanath in Gonda, Brij Bhushan allegedly refused to sit next to the newly-elected chief minister “out of resentment”, the Ayodhya journalist said. “Adityanath beckoned several times to sit close to him but he didn’t. In that election, he fielded his candidate against the party’s candidate and made sure he won.”

Many rumours

Brij Bhushan is currently serving his third and final term as the head of the WFI. During the election to his first term, he won against Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda, who said today he will file a defamation case against Brij Bhushan for “dragging” his name into the controversy.

A local journalist said Brij Bhushan “used to wrestle from a young age”, hence his interest in the sport.

Sports journalists are teeming with anonymous anecdotes about Brij Bhushan’s past behaviour during sporting events and towards wrestlers. While Newslaundry could not verify these incidents, they are quite telling.

A journalist who attended the Rio Olympics in 2016 said, “Sakshi Malik had just won the bronze medal. It was a big win, it was her day. We journalists were talking to her when Brij Bhushan and his men came and scolded her harshly, saying they would talk to the media. They were anxious to take credit. He was speaking as if he had won the medal.”

A journalist who was covered several Olympics said sexual harassment is worryingly common in sports like wrestling since participants are often from poorer backgrounds.

“Five years ago, a camp was organised in Lucknow. A junior girl filed a complaint and a Hindi newspaper reported that a case of sexual harassment had been registered,” said the journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Singh got the case suppressed. Had it happened in Delhi, it would have been easier to work out the details. We tried but couldn’t find out anything about the complainant.”

He added, “That’s why camps are organised in places like Lucknow...There is no media and the police are with him.” It should be noted that the women wrestlers have said Brj Bhushan allegedly sexually exploited participants at national camps “for years”, singling out a centre in Lucknow.

Sports journalist Chander Shekhar Luthra told Newslaundry of his own clash with Brij Bhushan in 2016, when wrestler Narsingh Yadav failed a dope test and was subsequently banned for four years. Yadav had been scheduled to participate in the Rio Olympics.

“Singh insisted Narsingh would play. On August 4 that year, I wrote a story on how India would now not be able to compete in the 74 kg category,” Luthra said. “When I reached Rio, [Singh’s] people surrounded me and said, ‘What have you written? Wait and watch, he will play for India.’ These people kept fighting for Narsingh...Praveen Rana was also named in the 74 kg category but because of Singh’s stubbornness, no one could participate in that category that year.”

Another unnamed sports journalist said the government committee that will now investigate the allegations is a “tool to avoid” problems. “Even after such huge allegations and political pressure, they’ve formed a committee instead of removing him. That shows how powerful Singh is,” they said. “There is very little chance he will resign. Most committees formed till date have been inconclusive. Let’s see this one too.”

This story was translated from Hindi to English by Shardool Katyayan.","Meanwhile, Thakur said Brij Bhushan will cooperate with the investigation and “step aside” in the interim period.

Vinayak Padmadeo

New Delhi, January 24

The Sports Ministry has hit back at the claims made by Indian wrestlers that they weren’t consulted before the appointment of the five-member oversight committee that will probe the sexual harassment allegations against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik took to social media to raise objections over the formation of the committee. Ministry sources, however, said it were the wrestlers who had suggested three names during the first meeting with Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.

“It’s sad our views weren’t taken before the formation of the committee,” Bajrang wrote on his social media page. Vinesh and Sakshi also followed suit and tagged PM Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and the Sports Minister in their posts.

Meanwhile, the oversight committee met for the first time today and decided to help 27 of the 36 wrestlers compete at Croatia ranking series that starts on February 1.

Six-time world champion boxer Mary Kom, wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former badminton player Trupti Murgunde, former SAI ED Radhica Sreeman and former TOPS chief Cdr Rajesh Rajagopalan (retd) were named in the committee to probe all allegations.

The latest public outburst from the top wrestlers is learnt to have surprised theministry officials, who have said that the wrestlers were the ones to suggest three names in the first meeting with the minister last Thursday. “Mary Kom’s was the first name they suggested. Radhica Sreeman and Cdr Rajesh Rajagopalan’s names were also put forward by them in the same meeting,” sources told The Tribune.

Sources have also confirmed that the wrestlers had also proposed the names of Babita Phogat and wrestling coach Kuldeep in the committee.

“If they had objections they could have called SAI or ministry officials. Just look at their tweets. It is all similar,” the sources added.

Sources have also confirmed that the wrestlers have reservations on London Olympics bronze medal winner Yogeshwar Dutt’s name as they perceive him to be a confidant of WFI president Singh. “I do not understand what their problem with Yogeshwar is while they are happy with Babita Phogat? They are not politicians,” sources said.

In another development, wrestling international federation, United World Wrestling (UWW), has approved the ministry’s appointment. In a mail correspondence, the UWW has asked that one member from the committee be nominated as a point person for all future correspondence. India is to host the Senior Asian Wrestling Championships in New Delhi in March and UWW’s approval raises hopes that the country will stay host.

The protest didn't come about overnight; the causes go back several months and span several issues, from sexual exploitation to mental harassment and death threats. Beyond these major allegations, though, there was also a build-up of several other issues, like:

No physio (of their choice) for women wrestlers at Tokyo Olympics

Vinesh went to Tokyo without long-time personal coach Woller Akos and physiotherapist Poornima Ngomdir by her side. With the IOA issuing a limit on the support staff (limited to 33% of the number of athletes), the WFI decided not to approve their accreditation.

The wrestlers were then later allotted a physio, who was originally part of the shooting contingent.

Is it a crime to ask for one Physiotherapist for four women wrestlers when there are instances of one athlete having multiple coaches/ Staff? Where is the balance? We have asked for a Physio long back and not at the last moment as reported.@IOA_Official @PMOIndia @ianuragthakur pic.twitter.com/bwbOQfFglo - Vinesh Phogat (@Phogat_Vinesh) July 22, 2021

Speaking at the protest last week, Vinesh detailed how she struggled to cut weight days before her opening bout at the Olympics and how the WFI president and general secretary had access to the Games Village (essentially as part of this limited support staff).

WFI vs private sports sponsors like OGQ, JSW

Another major issue in the eyes of the WFI in the Vinesh physio case was that the physio was attached to the private body that backed her, Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ). This had been a long-running issue - the WFI had denied OGQ's physios' access to the national camp as well in the run-up to the Olympics.

Post the Olympics, Singh, in an interview with the Indian Express, slammed private bodies like JSW and OGQ for trying to take over the sport and sidelining the WFI. He felt these private bodies only signed on established wrestlers and claimed credit for their successes, thereby taking away the spotlight from the Federation. This despite the fact that (at the time), of the 32 wrestlers supported by OGQ, 23 were below the age of 19.

WFI v Vinesh Phogat - the bout within a larger battle

He also said that he would not allow players sponsored by these bodies to represent the WFI in the future. The Federation said athletes had to seek approval from them before signing any contracts with private bodies.

Wrestlers' post-Olympics ordeal

Three days after the Tokyo Olympics, the WFI issued a show cause notice on Vinesh (for not staying with her teammates at the Games Village, for not training with the Indian wrestlers and for not wearing the official singlet of the Indian contingent), Sonam Malik (for asking a SAI official to collect her passport from the WFI office) and Divya Sain (because her father had apparently criticized WFI in a video).

Vinesh denied all the charges made against her. She recently explained why she did not wear the official singlet, which she said was of ""zero quality.""

The WFI later forgave the three wrestlers with a condition that they would face a life ban if they did not toe the WFI's line going forward.

In March 2022 Bajrang also lashed out at the WFI for denying him a physiotherapist. The Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist said he hadn't fully recovered from the knee injury he sustained around the Olympics and claimed all his requests for a full-time physiotherapist went unheard.

On their part, the WFI said they had approved a personal physiotherapist - Dr Anand Kumar from the Indian Railways - but he hadn't received permission from his employers and that Bajrang did not want to work with the two other physiotherapists available at the national camp.

No foreign coaches allowed, national camps compulsory

A major decision the WFI took after the Olympics was to not to renew the contracts of the foreign coaches. Those affected included Bajrang (Shako Bentinidis), Vinesh (Woller Akos), Ravi Dahiya (Kamal Malikhov) and Deepak Punia (Murad Gaidarov). Although the concept of personal foreign coaches is new in Indian wrestling, it has also led to positive results: Bajrang medalled at every major event while training with Shako, while Ravi won the Olympic silver under Malikhov. Deepak too became the world junior champion while working with his Russian coach.

However, Singh, in an interview with ESPN, felt a foreign coach should look after ""two or three athletes rather than just one athlete.""

This was seen as a move to exert further control on the wrestlers and make the national camps a compulsory affair. If athletes don't train with personal coaches, then the national camp was the only other go.

The WFI then added a clause that wrestlers would be eligible to compete for the country only if they were a regular part of the national camp. This was the first time such a diktat had been enforced.

WFI president's misdemeanors

Among the major points of the protest was Singh's way of running the Federation and his supposedly dictatorial style of functioning. Take these two incidents:

In August 2022, he stopped a bout mid-way so that a few seers from Ayodhya could bless the wrestlers. This was a final in the women's selection trials (for the World Championships). The seers blessed them and a round of pictures was taken before the wrestlers could resume their bout.

Back in 2021, Singh slapped a wrestler during the U15 Nationals in Ranchi, an incident caught on video. It's reported that the wrestler requested Singh to allow him to compete despite being overage - because he trained in Singh's akhara in Gonda. Singh took issue with that.","The protest didn't come about overnight; the causes go back several months and span several issues, from sexual exploitation to mental harassment and death threats.

Three wrestlers who have accused Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh of sexual harassment have claimed that they were not consulted by the Indian Sports Ministry on the establishment of an Oversight Committee to investigate the national governing body.

India's Sports Minister Anurag Thakur appointed Olympic bronze medallist boxer and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) Athletes Commission chair Mary Kom to head up a five-person Committee managing the WFI's affairs and investigating allegations of ""sexual misconduct, financial irregularities and misgovernance"".

Kom had already been appointed to lead a seven-person IOA Committee to investigate the accusation.

Three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat and Olympic bronze medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik accused Singh and other officials of misconduct and sexually harassing several women in the national set-up.

All three alleged on Twitter that they had not been consulted by the Ministry on the composition of the Oversight Committee.

""We were assured that we would be consulted before the Oversight Committee was formed,"" all three posted from their accounts.

""It is very sad that we were not even consulted before the formation of this Committee.""

The Sports Ministry had suspended all activities of the WFI on Saturday (January 21), leading to the cancellation of its Annual General Meeting.

This followed three days of protests from wrestlers in India's capital New Delhi calling for Singh's dismissal and the dissolution of the WFI.

Kom was joined by fellow London 2012 bronze medallist in wrestling Yogeshwar Dutt, former badminton player Trupti Murgunde and ex-Sports Authority of India officials Radhica Sreeman and Rajesh Rajagopalan on the Oversight Committee.

It has been granted one month to complete its investigation.

Singh has denied all the allegations and claimed ""there is a conspiracy"" against him.

He has stepped aside until the investigation concludes.","Wrestlers who accused WFI President of sexual harassment claim not consulted on Oversight CommitteeThree wrestlers who have accused Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh of sexual harassment have claimed that they were not consulted by the Indian Sports Ministry on the establishment of an Oversight Committee to investigate the national governing body.

The wrestlers had accused the BJP MP of sexual harassment. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said an impartial inquiry should be carried out into the allegations levelled by the wrestlers against the WFI president. (HT File)

Addressing a press conference here, Hooda said an impartial inquiry should be carried out into the allegations levelled by the wrestlers against the WFI president.

“The wrestling body president has unnecessarily tried to drag Deepender and my name into the matter. I am consulting with lawyers for filing a defamation case against WFI president,” he added.

The former CM said that sportspersons are the pride of our country and they should get justice.

“There should be a fair inquiry into the allegations levelled by a junior coach against Haryana minister Sandeep Singh,” Hooda added.

Commenting on a question on the Congress’s preparedness for the 2024 polls, the leader of opposition said that people have made up their mind to bring back the Congress government in the state and this was visible in the ‘historic support’ received by Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra in Haryana.

“Today, people are facing a lot of problems. The Congress will go to people on issues like corruption, unemployment, inflation, increasing crime and drugs,” he said.

Supporting the demands of sugarcane farmers, Hooda reiterated the government should accept their demand.

“The farmers are demanding a rate of ₹450 per quintal. The government should at least give the farmers of Haryana the same rate as that of Punjab. During the Congress government, there was a record increase of 165% in the rate of sugarcane, while during the BJP regime it was increased by only 17%,” he added.

Backing the sarpanches opposing e-tendering, Hooda said the government should trust the elected representatives and give them a chance to get development work done in the village.","Former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday slammed Bharatiya Janata Party MP and Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh for ‘dragging’ his and his Rajya Sabha MP son Deepender Singh Hooda’s name into the wrestlers’ protest.

“I would like to express my support to all the members of the Indian wrestling team and all the wrestling fans. All members of the Federation should leave immediately,” Shako wrote on Instagram.

“I have been serving this beautiful sport for 35 years, but I have never had contact with such non-professionals.

“They put me in hell for what is called 4 years. There is no point in telling all the details here, I will just say that they showed disrespect to everyone.”

Under the guidance of Bentinidis, the 27-year-old Bajrang won an Olympic bronze medal in Tokyo, 2018 Asian Games gold and a bronze medal at the 2019 world championship.

“For four years, I was accredited only for the Olympic Games, and with the help of the Olympic Committee and my athlete, they lied to me every time,” he said.

“Your last name was given and you should have taken it when you arrived, but you were even on the list (it’s just funny).

“I always tried to lead with my program so that we would have results, so that the whole world could see our strength and unity. They demotivated me to continue my successful career.

“I can imagine how many athletes have given up on wrestling. Most of the wrestlers all over India are not going hungry and all the conditions are there to help these talented wrestlers.

“I would like to say a few words of thanks to the two biggest companies that played the biggest role (not the federation) but these sponsors JSW sport and Olympic Gold Quest.

“Sportsmen. If it were not for the above-mentioned sponsors (JSW-OGQ), the country would not have so many medals.

“The federation should be immediately cleaned of these illegal people so that a person who loves this sport like his own family comes to the head,” he added.

His name shares space in the CBI files with Dawood Ibrahim on the one hand, and saffron titans such as LK Advani, MM Joshi and Kalyan Singh on the other.According to CBI records, Brij Bhushan allegedly harboured shooters of Dawood who had gunned down three people at Mumbai’s JJ Hospital in 1992. Three months later, he was accused of conspiring with those behind the demolition of the Babri Masjid. He was eventually exonerated in both cases. His latest poll affidavit, filed before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, mentions four pending criminal cases.Born in 1957 at Bisnoharpur village, Brij Bhushan is from a family of former Congress members. He earned his political spurs at Ayodhya’s Saket Degree College as the student union’s general secretary. In politics as in wrestling, Brij Bhushan thrived by cultivating the image of a bahubali (strongman) in Gonda and the surrounding districts.Brij Bhushan’s journey as an MP started in 1991 when BJP fielded him for his active role in Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In 1996, he was in Tihar jail for allegedly helping Dawood’s henchmen; hence the party fielded his wife Ketaki, who won by 80,000 votes.Brij Bhushan returned to win from Gonda in 1999 before being embroiled in a dispute with RSS functionary Nanaji Deshmukh over renaming Gonda as Jayaprkash Nagar ahead of 2004 polls. He was shifted to Balrampur seat after being replaced in Gonda by BJP MLA Ghanshyam Shukla. The latter died in a road accident on the day of polling, leading to allegations of murder.His relations with BJP started worsening after this and he joined Samajwadi Party just before the 2009 LS polls. SP fielded him from Kaiserganj and he won for the fourth time. However, months before the 2014 LS elections, he returned to BJP and won the Kaiserganj seat twice after that.With the rise in his political stature, Brij Bhushan’s passion for wrestling kept growing. He took over as the WFI chief in 2011 and has been elected to the post thrice since.Brij Bhushan’s younger son Karan Bhushan Singh is now the vice-president of the WFI. One of his sons-in-law is an office-bearer of Bihar Wrestling Federation. His youngest son Prateek is a two-time MLA from Gonda, while wife Ketaki is the Gonda Zila Panchayat president.According to CBI records, Brij Bhushan allegedly harboured shooters of Dawood who had gunned down three people at Mumbai’s JJ Hospital in September 1992. Three months later, he was accused of conspiring with those behind the demolition of the Babri Masjid. He was eventually exonerated in both cases.

After they skipped the first meeting on Saturday, the wrestlers have been given one final chance to appear before the panel on February 11. New Delhi, Jan 20 (ANI): Wrestler Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat speak during a silent protest against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and its chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh against whom sexual harassment allegations were made, at Jantar Mantar, in New Delhi on Friday. (ANI Photo/ Ishant) (Ishant )

It is learnt that the wrestlers, in a letter to the seven-member IOA panel headed by Athletes Commission chairperson MC Mary Kom, said that since some of the members are also in the Oversight Committee appointed by the Union sports ministry, it made little sense to appear before two panels conducting similar investigations.

The five-member Oversight Committee is also headed by woman boxing stalwart Mary Kom and includes 2012 London Olympics wrestling bronze medallist Yogeshwar Dutt. This panel has been tasked to run the day-to-day affairs of the WFI and probe allegations of “sexual misconduct'', financial impropriety and misgovernance against WFI officials and some coaches.

Dutt’s presence in both the committees is also a sore point for the wrestlers, who feel he had come out in support of WFI president Singh in his media statements.

However, Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia, while objecting to the Oversight Commitee being constituted without the protesting wrestlers being consulted, has said they had no issue with the IOA panel.

Swinging into action within hours of the wrestlers filing a complaint to IOA president PT Usha, IOA called an executive committee meeting and formed the panel as per the Visakha guidelines that deal with sexual harassment.

The other IOA panel members are Alaknanda Ashok, Sahdev Yadav, Dola Bannerjee, Dutt and advocates Talish Ray and Shlok Chandra.

“The wrestlers have been given one last opportunity to present themselves before the panel on February 11 after which the panel will submit its report to the IOA executive committee,” said an official with knowledge of the developments.","After they skipped the first meeting on Saturday, the wrestlers have been given one final chance to appear before the panel on February 11.

The protest was led by well-known athletes Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sarita Mor and Sakshi Malik, and they sought the dismissal of Brij Bhushan Singh from his position. The government announced that he would step down from his position till a committee that was to be set up to investigate the charges submitted its report. Committees are usually signs of compromises or means to delay decisions on an issue. The government dillydallied on a decision on the wrestlers’ demand for three days. It was only when it realised that their protest was evoking massive public sympathy that it deigned to talk to them and announced that Singh would temporarily move away and a committee would be set up.

In the normal course, when sexual harassment charges are made and the internal committee system is non-existent or dysfunctional, a police case must be registered and investigations made. In this case, the charge is that many women wrestlers were harassed and that they did not have the courage to go public because the accused is a powerful person. Singh is a five-time MP and a powerful leader of the BJP. He has been president of the Wrestling Federation for over a decade. He is very influential in the party and in the sports field. That could be the reason why he is being treated with kid gloves even when serious charges have been made against him. It is easy to imagine what would have been the response if the same charges had been made against a less connected person, or an opposition party leader. The wrestlers who made the charges are unhappy that the members of the probe committee were finalised without consultation with them, though they had been told that they would be consulted. Taking the complainants into confidence would have created greater trust in the working of the committee not only among the complainants but among the public also. It should be remembered that the public is also a party because the charges are public and are against a person in public life. It is unfortunate that this was not done.

The charges and the way they were handled expose many faults in the system and the rot within. There was no credible grievance redressal system in the wrestlers’ body which the aggrieved athletes could trust. Women, even those who are well-known, find it difficult to have their grievances attended to and redressed promptly and effectively. The system works against them.","In the normal course, when sexual harassment charges are made and the internal committee system is non-existent or dysfunctional, a police case must be registered and investigations made.

BENGALURU – An unprecedented public protest by top Indian wrestlers alleging sexual harassment and assault by officials has roiled one of India’s most popular sports.

New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar – a heritage astronomical observatory and official civil rights protest site usually thronged by farmers and activists – was the site of uncommon scenes from Jan 18 to 20, as dozens of India’s top wrestlers in tracksuits and wearing medals protested against continual harassment that has lasted for years.

Some of India’s best-known men and women wrestlers, as well as hundreds of their supporters, have accused Mr Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the president of the country’s wrestling federation, of sexual harassment, and demanded his sacking.

Ms Vinesh Phogat, 28, a 2018 Commonwealth and Asian Games champion, said that Mr Singh and other officials had sexually harassed women athletes for many years. “I know about 10 to 20 girls who have been exploited in the national camp over the past 10 years,” she said in tears.

The protest was reportedly sparked by phone calls that Ms Phogat received from young women wrestlers who were afraid to attend a training camp in Lucknow, where the federation chief lives.

The wrestlers also accused Mr Singh of running the federation “like a tyrant” for 12 years, embezzling sports funds, taking bribes to recruit officials, and mentally harassing athletes. They said they would boycott all competitions until he was removed.

Ms Phogat posted on social media a letter they had sent on Jan 20 to the Indian Olympic Association. In it, the wrestlers wrote: “We fear for our lives.”

Mr Singh flatly denied all the allegations to the media, saying: “Even if one wrestler comes forward and says that she has been sexually harassed, that day I can be hanged.”

Meanwhile, the federation’s official Twitter account shared videos of Mr Singh inaugurating gyms and attending training camps, and a widely ridiculed video of two young wrestlers defending the federation in a rehearsed speech they delivered in unison.

In a Jan 20 letter to the sports ministry, the wrestling federation described the allegations as “malicious and unfounded” and said the athletes had “acted more in personal interest or under undue pressure or under any bigger conspiracy to malign and defame the present management”.

Mr Singh is also an MP from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. He is a political heavyweight in three districts in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, from where he has been elected to Parliament six times. He still faces several other pending criminal charges, including of robbery and attempted murder.

On Jan 20, the Indian Olympic Association said it had formed a seven-member committee to probe the allegations. The committee is headed by Ms M.C. Mary Kom, an Indian boxing icon, and includes Olympic medallist Yogeshwar Dutt.

The sports ministry also promised on Jan 20 to form a committee to investigate the charges, after which protesting athletes called off their demonstration.

The next day, the ministry suspended a senior federation official and said that Mr Singh would step aside until the government-appointed committee completed its investigation.

The five-member government committee is also to be headed by Ms Mary Kom and includes Mr Dutt. It is supposed to submit its report in a month, and run the wrestling federation in the interim period.

With the government cancelling all wrestling events, and some ministers accusing the teary wrestlers of having “personal hidden agendas”, the #MeToo battle is bound to get more pitched.

The protesting wrestlers said they were unhappy with the composition of the committee, with some of them tweeting: “It is very sad that we were not even consulted before the formation of this committee.”

The scandal has raised questions about the effectiveness of formal grievance redress processes within Indian sports. One of the most vocal protesters, 2016 Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik, is a member of the wrestling federation’s sexual harassment committee, a sign of the body’s powerlessness, sports observers said.

Ms Sharda Ugra, a senior sports journalist, said: “There is no proper structure to protect our athletes. The government committee is a joke, it’s a red herring, it’s a smokescreen.”

Wrestling in India has a long tradition going back several centuries. It is the only sport in which the country has won at least one medal in each of the past four Olympic Games.","January 27, 2023BENGALURU – An unprecedented public protest by top Indian wrestlers alleging sexual harassment and assault by officials has roiled one of India’s most popular sports.

These were the two favourite moves of Brijbhushan Sharan Singh as his interest in wrestling took shape under mahant Baba Gyan Das of the Sagariya Patti in Hanuman Garhi, Ayodhya. The first is a quick move wherein the opponent is turned over, flung and pinned to the ground. The second entails hoisting up one’s opponent on one’s back and then flinging him on his back.

A big factor that contributes to Singh’s power is the network of 29 educational institutions he has founded in his home district in Uttar Pradesh.

These are the very moves that have served Singh well in his political career. He is now in his sixth term as a Lok Sabha member. The first was in 1991. By the time the Lok Sabha elections of 1996 came, he was locked up in Tihar jail, on charges of sheltering the associates of gangster Dawood Ibrahim. There was speculation that he had helped Ibrahim’s relatives escape to Pakistan via Nepal. There was also buzz that he had sheltered gangs that had targeted Ibrahim’s family. “Singh stuck to the code of brotherhood of criminals,” said an old-time BJP member. “He offered help to all manner of criminals, no matter which end of the spectrum they were on.” None of the charges against Singh was proved.

Also, being in jail―on charges under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act―did little to dim Singh’s political prospects. The BJP offered a ticket to his wife, Ketki Devi. The sympathy for Singh, who had by then cultivated the image of a staunch hindutva leader (he was one of the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case and had led a ‘Matra Raksha Rath Yatra’ against the activities of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence), translated into his wife polling 28,490 more votes than he had.

Balram Das of the Sagariya Patti has known Singh since 1986. He dismissed all charges against his former wrestling mate. “He has worked with passion since he was a student,” he said. “Under him, wrestling in India reached its pinnacle. He is solely responsible for turning it into a sport that can change wrestlers’ lives. Those who are making allegations against him have benefitted most under his chairmanship of the Wrestling Federation of India.”

But not all was well within Singh’s own household in Gonda (117km from Lucknow). In June 2004, his eldest son, Shakti, took his life with his father’s licenced pistol. The suicide note left behind accused Singh of not being a good father. There was also the charge that he, a rich man, had held back money from his four children.

While only the family knows if the death led to any introspection on Singh’s part, the politician himself chose to blame television serials. “You cannot always be friendly with your children…. Serials are poisoning children’s minds,” he had said.

When his father, Jagdamba Sharan Singh, was in hospital for 18 days, the son had paid him just one, half-hour visit.

Unexplained deaths seem to have surrounded Singh. In 2019, a constable posted at his official residence in Delhi shot himself. No suicide note was found.

A big factor that contributes to Singh’s power is the network of 29 educational institutions―schools and colleges―he has founded in his home district. These are the kind of institutions where successful exam performances are guaranteed, and where flying squads that make surprise checks to curb cheating never visit.

Yet, no one in Gonda openly accuses Singh of anything. This, despite the fact that in his 2019 affidavit filed before the Election Commission, Singh himself provided details of charges against him―these include dacoity, attempt to murder and disappearance of evidence.

Rakesh Verma, a Gonda-based social activist, said, “Singh is among the most domineering leaders of Purvanchal. I have never heard of any kind of allegations against his character. Maybe someone being beaten up or scolded, but these are internal matters. I find allegations of his behaviour towards women wrestlers incomprehensible. But then, politics is a game of ambition.”

Radhey Shyam Mishra, a former teacher from Kaiserganj (Singh’s constituency) said that he had watched Singh’s journey since 1979, when he became students’ union general secretary in the K.S. Saket P.G. College, Ayodhya, from where he earned a law degree.

“He has a knack of strengthening himself in any and every way,” said Mishra. “He is both a loyal friend and a dreadful enemy in politics. From the graduates of his educational institutes, he is cultivating an army of young supporters. Is that right or wrong? Whatever it might be, no one dares open his mouth.”

But some are willing to speak. Mayank Singh, a construction contractor who works in both Balrampur (Singh’s former constituency) and Gonda, said, “He is a dabbang (muscleman) who has his own ways of establishing his men in business and politics. I cannot divulge what I have seen. But infer from the fact that he got his son, Prateek, elected as MLA from Gonda when he misses no opportunity to say that he is in a party that does not promote nepotism. He may have been released from Tihar, but that is a black stain that will forever mark him.”

There are other stains that dot Singh’s life. In 1993, Pandit Singh, a Samajwadi Party leader, was shot. In 2004, Ghanshyam Shukla, a BJP leader died in an apparent accident, which his wife alleged was a murder. Singh’s hand was suspected in both. In the first, the MP-MLA court acquitted him; in the second, the CBI handed him a clean chit.

While most of Singh’s political career has been with the BJP, from 2008 to 2014 he was with the Samajwadi Party, on whose ticket he won his fourth term in Parliament. He then came down on the party, declaring Akhilesh Yadav the ‘Last king of the Sultanate of Mulayam Singh Yadav’. Not too long ago, he criticised the state government for its lack of flood preparedness, saying that public representatives had been reduced to being mere observers. It was a jibe at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

As in politics, so in his personal life, Singh gets full marks for enthusiasm. He lists listening to Bhojpuri music as one of his hobbies and has on occasion taken to the stage to perform. Given the opportunity, he also reels off Urdu shayari. Both are terribly off-key.

The latest charges might, however, throw him totally off-scale. And then, none of his favourite kushti manoeuvres might be able to save him.","These were the two favourite moves of Brijbhushan Sharan Singh as his interest in wrestling took shape under mahant Baba Gyan Das of the Sagariya Patti in Hanuman Garhi, Ayodhya.

Abhishek, Harmanpreet, Shamsher Singh, Akashdeep and Sukhjeet scored for the Men in Blue.

India Men’s Hockey Team beat South Africa 5-2 in their 9th-12th placing match in the FIH Odisha Hockey Men’s World Cup 2023 Bhubaneswar-Rourkela. Playing in front of a packed audience in the stellar Birsa Munda Hockey Stadium on Saturday, India ensured an entertaining brand of hockey for the passionate crowds of Rourkela who beelined to the newly-built stadium for the last day’s proceedings in this stadium before the action moves to Bhubaneswar for the grand finale of the tournament on 29th January.

Ending their World Cup campaign with a win, India’s goals were scored by Abhishek (5′), Harmanpreet Singh (12′), Shamsher Singh (45′), Akashdeep Singh (49′) and Shamsher Singh (59′). For South Africa, Samkelo Mvimbi (49′) and Mustaphaa Cassiem (60′) scored.

Having beaten Japan 8-0 in their previous 9th-16th placing match, the hosts were up to the South African challenge as they began play with powerful attacking formations. The intent brought quick results with Captain Harmanpreet setting up Abhishek with a long pass to the top of the circle. Picking it up well, Abhishek spun around to beat the South African defender, taking a perfect shot into the goal.

The fifth-minute goal, put South Africa on the backfoot and under pressure they gave away a penalty corner early in the first quarter. Making use of the opportunity, Harmanpreet Singh struck a fine goal taking India’s lead to 2-0 in the 12th minute.

While the second quarter remained goalless despite quite a few PCs being awarded to India, their next goal came only at the end of the third quarter. It was a brilliant cross by Abhishek from the right flank to Shamsher in front of the goal mouth that did the trick with the latter finding the top of the net to fetch India its third goal.

In control of the proceedings, India struck another one in the 49th minute and this time it was Jarmanpreet’s cross to Akashdeep that helped India extend their lead to a formidable 4-0. Though South Africa scored a field goal in the 49th minute through Samkelo Mvimbi, it didn’t dent India’s attack as they struck another goal via Sukhjeet.

He made a fine attempt off a rebound he picked up from Akashdeep’s attempt that was pushed away from the South African defender. Though South Africa earned a penalty stroke which was covered by Mustaphaa Cassiem in the 60th minute, India signed off with a sweet 5-2 on board.

January 18 was just another day in the life of Ajay Kumar. He woke up to a cold morning in his village, Juan, Sonipat, dropped his daughter and son at the local government-run akhara (rural gymnasium), then took them to school on his bike. He went about his work on his farm of 21 bighas (about 7 acres), and did the evening round of the akhara, waiting while his children finished, as was his daily practice. In the evening, he flicked on the television. On the news, familiar faces put him on alert: women wrestlers were in a sit-in protest and had levelled charges of sexual abuse against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. “I got into the car with coach Sanjeet Chhikara [from the akhara], and without thinking about it too much, headed to Delhi,” he says. They sat in for three days with the contingent at Jantar Mantar.

For Mr. Kumar, this was personal. His daughter, Khushi Arya, 14, had just won silver in 2022, in the under-50 kg category, U-15 Grand Prix in Bahadurgarh, Haryana. It has been five years of sweat and toil for Khushi, who initially had to face neighbours’ jibes at taking up a ‘man’s sport’. She still deals with a sporting facility that has no changing rooms for women, waiting to shower back home. And despite the Haryana government’s Khel Nursery Scheme, started to encourage grassroots athletes, the scholarship money has never been credited to her account.

Mr. Kumar thinks back to the beginnings: of taking his two children (his son is a year younger than Khushi) to the running track that skirts the mud pit of the akhara. “Khushi would beat her younger brother and even some of the wrestlers who were training at the Khajan Singh Akhada, on the 2- to 3-km track,” he says. The family got her enrolled, despite the fact that she was just one of two girls amongst 50-55 boys and men.

At the heart of Khushi’s initial success is her family, and the conversations they have, openly. “For the longest time I believed that nothing like this could happen to a wrestler and that WFI would treat its people, who are assets, in a dignified way, but I am not worried as long as my father is there,” says Khushi.

She is interrupted by her father, who calls her naive. He says he can accompany her to local camps, but not those run by WFI; parents are not permitted there. “If anything ever happens...if they are not listening to world champions like [Olympian] Sakshi Malik and [two-time medal winner at the World Championships] Vinesh Phogat, why would they listen to a powerless farmer like me?” says Mr. Kumar, rhetorically.

Her mother, Sharda Devi, is more pragmatic, saying that women face harassment everywhere, whether in sports or in schools. She also has more faith in the system resolving this, with the Oversight Committee being appointed to investigate the charges. She still wonders though, “ Sab jaan kar bhi bacche ko jaane dein, ya itni mehnat ke baad bacche ke bhavishya par laat maar dein? (Despite knowing everything, should we let our child go? Or after all this hard work should we beat her future down?)”

Women wrestling with tradition

In what underscores Haryana’s dominance in women’s wrestling at the national level, Pankaj Nain, Director, Sports and Youth Affairs Department, Haryana, says that since 2002, women wrestlers from Haryana have won 26 medals, including eight golds, across a dozen international events: three Olympics, four Asian Games, and five Commonwealth Games. He claims about six States have expressed an interest in replicating the State’s sports policy, and a few had sent their delegations to study it.

In Haryana, community wrestling competitions, or dangals, are a tradition. Vikas Gulia, president, Baba Prakash Puri Sewa Samiti, one of the committees in Sonipat’s agrarian Purkhas village that has been organising dangals for over two decades now, says they started inviting female wrestlers about five years ago. The committee holds two dangals in a year — January 9 and November 18 — with the support of patrons, including local wrestlers who have landed government jobs under the sports quota, businessmen, and local politicians like councillor Satish Gulia, who donated ₹51,000 for their last dangal.

Just as traditional akharas, run mostly by former wrestlers as a give-back gesture, make up for the inadequate sports infrastructure in the State, dangals act as crucial ‘software’ for budding wrestlers, helping them financially in the absence of monetary support from the government in the initial years, while also offering them an opportunity to compete and learn.

Mr. Gulia said the prize money at dangals ranged from a few thousand rupees to a few lakhs; many professional wrestlers survived on these community wrestling competitions held all through the year, except the monsoon. During the peak season, March to July, one dangal is held every day in the State on an average.

Sonipat, Rohtak, and Jhajjar remain the wrestling hubs of the State, but the trend has caught on in the adjoining districts of Hisar, Panipat, and Jind as well, with the opening up of private academies and training centres.

However, compared to their male counterparts, women may receive less prize money, sometimes as low as 50% of the men’s fee. Some organising committees object to women participating, and some are deterred by the ‘additional costs’ in terms of wrestling mats, toilets, and changing rooms.

The game changer

“It was after Geeta Phogat won India’s first-ever international gold medal at the [Delhi] Commonwealth Games (CWG) in 2010 that the craze for women’s wrestling in the State hit the roof. Soon, women’s wrestling was all the rage. It’s no surprise that the participation of female wrestlers at our dangals has grown manifold over these years from around 25-30 five years ago to 100-odd this year,” says Mr. Gulia, who is also a coach at the local Baba Prakash Puri akhara. “Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sushil Kumar too have fought at the dangals in our village before they achieved stardom,” Mr. Gulia proclaims proudly, as he instructs girls and boys, teaching them how to hold a grip and select partners, while shouting for someone to warm up properly before entering the ring.

Suman Kundu, a bronze medallist at CWG 2010, tells us why the event was a turning point for girls in Haryana: “The stellar performance of the women wrestlers from the State, the wide media coverage, and above all, the opportunity for local villagers to watch the women perform live at an international event brought a sea change in their perception towards women wrestling,” says Ms. Kundu, now a Haryana Police Sub-Inspector, posted at Rohtak.

She recalls how fellow villagers, who had always snubbed her before the games despite her achievements in wrestling, gave her a “hero’s welcome” on her return to the village after the CWG feat. “Both my father and coach had to face everyone’s ire for years for ‘letting me’ choose wrestling. Haunted by the taunts, my father even stopped socialising, but continued to support me to give me a better future. My maternal uncles too did not approve of his decision and our families were not on talking terms for two years. But the Commonwealth Games in 2010 changed it all overnight, not just for me but for all girls out there. And the stadiums were flooded with aspiring women wrestlers after the 2014 Commonwealth Games and 2016 Olympics,” says Ms. Kundu, now a mother of two.

For girls like Khushi, the struggle has been more short-lived, with neighbours quickly changing their ‘punches’ for praise when she began winning at the local level. She also has role models to look up to. Hers is Vinesh Phogat, and her voice changes when she talks about the time Ms. Phogat met her at a training camp and praised her moves.

Khushi is focussed on making it to the international circuit, but with the contradictions of a regular teen, what makes her smile is the fact that she’s the first girl student to be selected sports captain at her school, South Point International in Ratangarh, Ambala district. It matters to her that her friends admire her and that she’s seen as someone who cannot be fooled with. She’s proud of the way her body has changed to be more muscular and likes to keep her hair short. “Men are more powerful,” she says, and enjoys the challenge of training with them, through period pains and stains. The boys treat her like one of them.

Retired District Sports Officer Ishwar Dahiya credits Chandgi Ram, a freestyle wrestler from Hisar’s Sisai village, for laying the foundation of women’s wrestling in Haryana in the late 1990s by encouraging his daughters, Sonika and Deepika Kaliraman, to take up the sport despite stiff social opposition. Mr. Dahiya remembers training his first-ever girls batch in Rohtak, in 2002.

“Initially, it was fame and recognition that drew the girls to wrestling courts in Haryana, but the successive State governments, especially Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s Congress regime, tweaked the sports policy to shower the players with heftier cash prize money and government jobs, making it a lucrative proposition. And with Haryana always dominating the national wrestling space, the girls in the State grabbed the opportunity with both hands. It pulled families, both with wrestling and non-wrestling backgrounds, to the sport in a big way,” says the 66-year-old.

The Hooda government filled hundreds of vacancies for coaches, set up residential training centres for different sports and amended the Haryana Police Service rules to reserve 3% permanent Deputy Superintendent of Police posts for direct appointment of outstanding sportspersons. Many players such as hockey’s Mamta Kharab, wrestler Geetika Jakhar, cricketer Joginder Sharma, boxer Vijender Singh, and incumbent Minister and hockey player Sandeep Singh reaped the benefits of the policy.

Khushi’s mother refers to a popular saying in Haryanvi: it says that while preparing a wrestler, all four corners of a house are shaken, in a reference to the economic, social, physical, and emotional labour that the whole family goes through. The women wrestlers of Haryana are shaking more than a house — they are in fact fighting injustice, entitlement, and a whole male mindset we loosely call patriarchy.","On the news, familiar faces put him on alert: women wrestlers were in a sit-in protest and had levelled charges of sexual abuse against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

With activities of the body governing the sport – the Wrestling Federation of India – suspended over grave charges levelled by top sportspersons, the oversight committee has approved of a 55-member contingent to participate in the Zagreb Open Grand Prix.

The committee, formed in the aftermath of an unprecedented protest by the country’s most successful wrestlers, has cleared the names of 36 wrestlers (11 Greco-Roman, 12 women’s wrestling and 13 freestyle) for the tournament, the Press Trust of India has reported.

The competition, which is a series that will affect players’ world rankings, is to be held from February 1 to 5. The government usually bears the cost of sportspersons attending such tournaments.

However, The New Indian Express has reported that it is unlikely that Olympics medallists Ravi Dahiya and Bajrang Punia and Worlds medallists Vinesh Phogat and Deepak Punia – who played an important role in leading the protests against WFI chief and Bharatiya Janata Party MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh – will agree to participate, even though their names have cleared. The wrestlers had accused Singh of sexually harassing multiple sportspersons.

A day ago, Phogat, Punia and others had said that they were not consulted when the government formed the oversight committee to look into their claims.

Headed by boxing MC Mary Kom, the committee includes former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, Mission Olympic Cell member and former badminton player Trupti Murgunde, ex-CEO of Target Olympic Podium Scheme, retired Commander Rajesh Rajagopalan, and former top official at SAI, Radhica Sreeman.

One reason behind the players’ inability to join the competition is their lack of training at this point, considering the turmoil in the sport recently, TNIE reported quoting unnamed sources.

The news outlet has also reported that there are also formal issues pertaining to visa procurement as Croatia has recently become a Schengen nation, leading to certain changes in rules.","New Delhi: Top names in wrestling are unlikely to compete in a crucial Zagreb meet for which their names were approved by the Union government-appointed oversight committee, reports say.

The father of the former world number one was not in attendance for the final amidst the flag controversy.

Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open 2023 by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in a gruelling final at the Rod Laver Arena on Sunday. It was his 10th win at this particular Grand Slam. By winning this year’s edition of the tournament, Djokovic extends his record as the all-time leading men’s player with the most Australian Open wins in the Open Era. He is also tied on 22 Grand Slams along with contemporary Rafael Nadal.

However, a particular individual was missing from World No.4’s player’s box during the final. Srdjan Djokovic, Novak Djokovic’s father, was not present courtside in the box with the rest of the family members and coaching staff. Reports have suggested that Novak’s father’s absence was related to visuals that have surfaced on the internet that saw Srdjan posing with a Russian flag.

The controversy

Srdjana Djokovic did not accompany Novak Djokovic’s mother Dijana at the final against Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece. He lost the chance to see his son win an unprecedented 10th Australian Open title. He was not in attendance at the semi-final as well, after multiple calls for his ban emerged, led by Ukraine, which is involved in a war with neighbouring country Russia.

Indian Sports Live Coverage on Khel Now

Vasyl Myroshnychenko, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, called for a ban on Srdjana Djokovic and the stripping of his accreditation. Incidentally, this was in response to a video posted on the internet that depicted Novak’s father holding a Russian flag with Vladimir Putin’s face on it.

During an interaction with the press, Novak Djokovic clarified that his father had no intention of supporting any sort of war initiative and that this incident had affected him. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has devastated the country and has led to the loss of life on both sides.

Despite the controversy revolving around his run-up to the final, Novak Djokovic was able to hold his nerve and secure the championship win. He won the final against Tsitsipas in straight sets by a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-5) score.

The military responded with strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza.There were no injuries reported on either side, but Gaza's armed groups have vowed further action.The United Nations human rights office had called earlier for an end to the ""endless cycle of violence"" in the West Bank, saying on Twitter that it ""must end"".As Israeli forces raided the crowded Jenin refugee camp early Thursday, gunshots rang through the streets and smoke billowed from burning barricades.The military said Israeli forces came under fire during a ""counterterrorism operation to apprehend an Islamic Jihad terror squad"" and shot several enemy combatants.The violence prompted the Palestinian Authority to announce it was cutting security coordination with Israel, a move criticised by the United States.The military said the incursion targeted Islamic Jihad militants who were allegedly behind attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians and, according to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, were planning ""to conduct a terror attack in Israel"".Three Palestinians were shot in a firefight, while Israeli forces shot a further two ""fleeing the scene"", an army statement said. Israeli forces also shot a sixth suspect inside a building, and other Palestinians were hit after firing on troops, the army said.There were no casualties among the Israeli forces, the military added.Wisam Bakr, director of the Jenin Government Hospital, said there was a ""state of panic"" in the paediatric ward, with some children suffering from tear gas inhalation.The Israeli military told AFP ""the activity was not far away from the hospital, and it is possible some tear gas entered through an open window"".Jenin resident Umm Youssef al-Sawalmi said homes were hit during the raid.

In all regions, improvements in living standards over the half-decade to 2024 are expected to be slower than from 2010-19,"" read the World Bank in Global Economic Prospects report.Pakistan's economic condition is precarious with low foreign exchange reserves and large fiscal and current account deficits that have been further worsened by severe flooding.About one-third of the country's land area was affected, damaging infrastructure, and directly affecting about 15 per cent of the population, reported The News International.Moreover, with low foreign exchange reserves and rising sovereign risk, Pakistan saw its currency depreciate by 14 per cent between June and December and its country risk premium rise by 15 percentage points over this same period.Amid this Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government has agreed to meet all conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the early resumption of the next review.Sharif on January 24 said that Pakistan's ruling PDM alliance is ready to sacrifice its ""political career for the sake of the country"" by accepting IMF's ""stringent"" conditions to revive the loan programme.Reports reveal that over 9,000 containers are stuck at different Pakistani seaports, threatening to disrupt the supply chains of essential goods. Inflation in the country has risen to almost 30 per cent. The country's funds are running low and food prices are increasing.According to Islam Khabar, importers are unable to clear containers due to a shortage of dollars, while shipping companies are threatening to suspend Pakistan's operations over the country's failure to make timely payments. This will negatively impact both imports and exports.The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has only USD 4.4 billion in forex reserves, barely enough for three weeks of imports, while the estimated needs to clear the containers and pending requests for opening more letters of credit is in the range of USD 1.5 billion to USD 2 billion, according to the Islam Khabar report.Businesses in Pakistan are at risk of closure due to a breakdown of supply chains as domestically manufactured goods rely on imported raw materials. The textile industry in Pakistan is also in a critical position as it is losing credibility and market share among international buyers.Hospitals in the country are running short of medicines, and there may soon be shortages of goods such as wheat, fertilizers, and gasoline.Prime Minister Sharif has thus asked people to conserve resources such as water, gas, and electricity to assist the government in reducing its import bill, which has risen significantly in recent years.Jaishankar also said that the Indus Waters Treaty is a technical matter and future course of action will depend on talks between the Indus Commissioners of India and Pakistan.""This is a technical matter, Indus Commissioners of both countries will talk about the Indus Water Treaty. We can only discuss our future steps after that,"" he said.India issued notice to Pakistan for modification of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of September 1960 after Islamabad's actions adversely impinged the provisions of the treaty.The notice was conveyed on January 25 through respective Commissioners for Indus Waters as per Article XII (3) of the IWT.The objective of the notice for modification is to provide Pakistan with an opportunity to enter into intergovernmental negotiations within 90 days to rectify the material breach of the IWT. This process would also update IWT to incorporate the lessons learned over the last 62 years.India has always been a responsible partner in implementing the IWT. Pakistan's actions, however, have encroached on the provisions of IWT and their implementation and forced India to issue an appropriate notice for modification of IWT.Highlighting sea-change in India's foreign policy, Jaishankar said that the country's influence has reached beyond the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.Speaking at the publication ceremony of the book ""Bharat Marg"" written by Jaishankar, he said, ""Nowadays India's influence has reached beyond the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, this is why I speak on history, big countries always think only about themselves, this is a deficiency in their DNA.""","PUNE: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said that just as the Pandavas could not choose their relatives, India cannot choose its geographical neighbours.
""It is a reality to us....Pandavas could not choose relatives, we can't choose our neighbours.

The Indian Express,,Pushkar Singh Dhami: ‘Experts have not linked projects and Joshimath incidents… development is needed’,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/uttarakhand-chief-minister-pushkar-singh-dhami-interview-8408244/,"As research goes on to assess the situation there, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami speaks to The Indian Express about what lies ahead,...",2023-01-27 18:26:26+05:30,Pushkar Singh Dhami: ‘Experts have not linked projects and Joshimath incidents… development is needed’,"When cracks appeared on roads and houses across Joshimath, a key point of discussion was the successive official reports that foretold the disaster in the hilly town. As research goes on to assess the situation there, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami speaks to The Indian Express about what lies ahead, the resettlement plan for the residents, and the action plan to prevent similar damage in other parts of the state. Excerpts:

The state government is in touch with the central agencies working in Joshimath. What lies ahead based on the assessment so far?

There are eight technical institutes here, a 10-member team from the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI); another 10-member team from the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI); a seven-member team from the Wadia Institute; seven Geological Survey of India (GSI) scientists; four Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) scientists; and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) officials.

While temporary relief options are already on – Rs 3.77 crore has been distributed to 307 affected families as interim relief – plans for temporary resettlement will be made according to the findings of these agencies. Our aim is to provide all possible facilities to people and resettle them in the best way. As far as the future of Joshimath is considered, around 70 per cent of the area is unaffected. The shops are open. People are going about their day-to-day life and are regularly visiting the Auli town close to Joshimath.

The yatra (Chardham Yatra) begins only after four months… Last year, the number of visiting tourists set a record. We are prepared this year too. There is no need for unnecessary doubts.

The Chamoli district administration is talking to the affected families. Is there a final decision on permanent rehabilitation?

A committee headed by the District Magistrate has been formed and they are conducting an assessment survey. All options are open for permanent rehabilitation. Currently, people are living in hotels and temporary shelters. The next step will be to shift them to prefabricated structures built on areas certified by geological experts. The third step would be permanent rehabilitation in a chosen and verified area.

Multiple options are being looked at. One is to give people money and the liberty to go and settle wherever they want. Another is providing land to help people build their houses. Both these options would be available and people would have the liberty to choose what they want. An amount of Rs 1.50 lakh is already being provided to the disaster-affected landowners until the permanent rehabilitation policy is determined. This includes an advance amount of Rs 1 lakh (which will be adjusted) and an additional Rs 50,000 for the transportation of goods and other immediate needs.

You recently met Home Minister Amit Shah. What requests were made to the Centre? Is there a specific amount you asked for rehabilitation work?

The Prime Minister himself is taking cognizance of the situation and is continuously monitoring it. He assured all possible help to Joshimath and Uttarakhand. We requested Amit Shahji to provide central help for the disaster relief work and he also assured all possible help. We have not given an estimated number to the Central government.

However, we informed them that based on the primary discussion with central technical institutions, there is need for widespread reconstruction in the area and that a final estimation would be given after the technical surveys are over.

In Joshimath, the state Cabinet proposed spending of funds on various short-term and medium-term works from its resources till funds are received as a relief package from the Centre. We assure that there will be no shortage of funds for the works undertaken.

Reports suggest that eight other districts in the state, apart from Chamoli, are facing a similar situation. Is the state government aware of this and is there a long-term plan?

We are a state that has always faced such disasters. This is the Himalayan region and it has always been geologically very active… That changes a lot of things. This is why we want to assess the carrying capacity of the land and make plans accordingly.

We have already instructed the Urban Development Department to prepare effective urban town planning in each district. Instructions have also been given for effective arrangement of drainage and sewer systems in hill towns. I have also directed officials to make a phase-wise plan where such systems are not in place.

There are allegations that we started too late in Joshimath and that places like Karnaprayag, where similar cracks have appeared in houses, are not getting the required attention.

We are fully aware of the situation in places like Karnaprayag and Dharchula and we are working there too. Relief work is also on. This is why we are focusing on proper drainage and sewer systems in all the affected areas across the state. We are making phase-wise plans. After a detailed study of the load-bearing capacity of all such areas, we will make a state-wide plan. Our priority is to balance ecology, economy and development moving forward.

Most of these affected places are near the ongoing Chardham Railway Project. Is there any plan to stop the project or at least reconsider it?

The expert reports and the findings of the central agencies have not suggested any connection between the projects and the disasters mentioned. All I would say is that it is not a good idea to jump to conclusions, and it is too soon to assume what is causing the cracks. We need to have some scientific basis for making such a claim.

People might be making claims for different reasons. What we need to understand is that infrastructure development is important for the state and the country. Development is needed and we cannot stop it just like that. For now, our focus is on the rehabilitation of those affected. We need to take care of the women, children and elders. We need better drainage and sewage systems and water outlets. This is our focus.

There is a lot of discussion on the 1976 M C Mishra report. Both the BJP and Congress are blaming each other for failing to implement its recommendations.

Some people will always try to politicise such issues. This is not the time for blame game. We should all avoid politicising this and come together to work. I personally do not want to blame anyone. My job is to provide relief to the people and make long-term plans to tackle the situation. That is precisely what I am doing.

The gag order issued by the NDMA after ISRO published images of a sinking Joshimath drew a lot of criticism. A minister in the state Cabinet suggested that the state government was involved in this decision.

We should always wait for official study reports on such sensitive issues. Saying anything without an official report is hasty. Therefore, such things should be avoided. Until we have received study reports from all institutions and have compiled all the reports, there are all kinds of possibilities.

Uniform Civil Code was one of your biggest electoral promises. Can we expect it to be implemented?

An expert committee is working on a UCC draft; we are the first in the country to have this. We expect to have the draft ready by this year and to start working on making it a law. As of now, the expert panel is compiling and studying the suggestions received by various stakeholders.

The state has taken a similar stand on religious conversion and made the law stricter.

Yes. Religious conversion was a serious issue in the state. Some people were using all kinds of tools to lure locals in rural and tribal areas. This is the Devbhoomi (land of gods) and such a disgusting practice should not be allowed here. Nothing should be allowed here that goes against religion.

This is why we made the anti-conversion law stricter and made unlawful conversions a cognizable and non-bailable offence, punishable with a prison term of up to 10 years. I invite other states also to make similar laws and ensure no one is lured into religious conversion.

Crimes against SCs, STs are increasing in the state.

There was an incident recently in Uttarkashi. We are making sure such incidents are not repeated in the state. We want everyone’s cooperation.","Excerpts:The state government is in touch with the central agencies working in Joshimath.

New Delhi, January 31

After sitting over the protesting wrestlers’ demands for over a week, the Sports Ministry has finally relented and added Babita Phogat to the Oversight Committee appointed to look after the functioning of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI).

Former Olympian Babita will be the sixth member of the committee, which was named on January 23 by the Sports Ministry to investigate allegations of sexual harassment made against WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh by several women wrestlers, and to also manage the day-to-day affairs of the federation.

India’s top wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik, had criticised the Sports Ministry for not consulting them before the appointment of the five-member Oversight Committee. The Ministry had strongly rebutted the criticism, saying that three of the names in the committee were suggested by the wrestlers themselves.

Boxing legend MC Mary Kom was named the chair of the committee, which also included Yogeshwar Dutt, Trupti Murgunde, Radhica Sreeman and Cdr (Retd) Rajesh Rajagopalan.

There was speculation last week that the wrestlers, who have made serious allegations against Singh, wrestling coaches and office staff, may restart their dharna after their demands — including the disbanding of WFI — were summarily dismissed and Singh remained in office.

Babita’s inclusion in the committee is likely to soothe nerves among the wrestling community. As reported by this newspaper, the wrestlers had been talking about resuming their protest as none of their primary demands was met.

When the Oversight Committee was named, the inclusion of London Olympics bronze medallist Yogeshwar Dutt had caused worry in the wrestling community as they had targeted Dutt, a BJP leader, for siding with WFI.

They wanted Babita, also a BJP leader, and Greco-Roman coach Kuldeep Singh to be named in the committee. Incidentally, Babita had tried to form a parallel wrestling federation in Haryana before the 2022 National Games in Gujarat. She and some others, with the support of then Haryana Sports Minister Sandeep Singh, had formed an association and attempted to send their team to the National Games. Their request was shot down by the National Games Organising Committee and the team sent by the WFI-affiliated Haryana state unit was entered in the competition in Gujarat.

Date with IOA

Meanwhile, the Indian Olympic Association-appointed probe committee — which is, incidentally, also headed by Mary Kom — has invited the wrestlers for a hearing on February 11. After initially suggesting that they had faith in IOA in their fight against WFI, the wrestlers had ignored the seven-member committee that met last week. This probe committee’s members are IOA treasurer Sahdev Yadav, Kalyan Chaubey, Yogeshwar Dutt, Dola Banerjee, Alaknanda Ashok and two lawyer-members, apart from Mary Kom.

“Yes, we have asked the wrestlers to appear before us again. I think a letter has been sent to them, so let’s see whether they meet us,” said a source in the probe committee.","The Ministry had strongly rebutted the criticism, saying that three of the names in the committee were suggested by the wrestlers themselves.

The development comes days after IANS had reported that the government might add a few more names in the panel after top wrestlers — Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, and Sakshi Malik — expressed their disappointment over the formation of the oversight committee without their consultation.

Earlier, the protest by the wrestlers at Jantar Mantar in the national capital had been called off after the wrestlers held a five-hour meeting with Sports Minister Thakur, who had promised them that the allegations would be investigated.","Former India wrestler Babita Phogat was on Tuesday added to the panel of the Oversight Committee, which has been formed by the Sports Ministry, to probe into the allegations of sexual misconduct, financial irregularities against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and its president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh by country’s top grapplers, earlier this month.

Famous wrestler Babita Phogat on Tuesday joined the Oversight Committee which has been formed by the Sports Ministry to investigate the allegations of sexual harassment against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and its president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Babita's cousin Vinesh Phogat led a protest at Jantar Mantar against Brij Bhushan and the WFI, along with several other wrestlers including Sakshee Malik and Bajrang Punia.

Vinesh alleged that Brij Bhushan and several coaches of the WFI have been sexually harassing the female wrestlers for years. The wrestlers also claimed that Brij Bhushan and the coaches used to physically assault them.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh was eventually asked to step down from his position until the probe against him and the WFI is complete.

The panel has scheduled a second meeting for February 11.

Three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat has led the accusations against Singh, supported by other major wrestlers in the country, Olympic bronze medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik.

This group previously stated they had not been consulted on the creation of the Indian Sports Ministry Oversight Committee to investigate the WFI.

Sports Minister Anurag Thakur appointed Olympic bronze medallist boxer and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) Athletes Commission chair Mary Kom to take charge of the five-person Oversight Committee managing WFI's affairs and investigating allegations of ""sexual misconduct, financial irregularities and misgovernance.""

Kom had already been appointed to the IOA panel to investigate the accusation.

""We were assured that we would be consulted before the Oversight Committee was formed,"" posted Phogat, Punia and Malik on Twitter.

""It is very sad that we were not even consulted before the formation of this Committee.""

On January 21, the Sports Ministry suspended all activities of the WFI until the investigation concluded, requesting Singh step down from his position temporarily.

According to Hindustan Times, the wrestlers sent a letter to the IOA panel, saying that since some of the members of the panel were also part of the Oversight Committee, it did not make sense to appear before both panels.

London 2012 Olympic wrestling bronze medallist Yogeshwar Dutt is on both panels too - a contentious appointment due to his supposed leniency to Singh in media statements.

Punia said they had no issue with the IOA panel.

Alaknanda Ashok, Sahdev Yadav, Dola Banerjee and advocates Talish Ray and Shlok Chandra are also on the IOA panel.

""The wrestlers have been given one last opportunity to present themselves before the panel on February 11 after which the panel will submit its report to the IOA Executive Committee,"" said an IOA official, according to Hindustan Times.

News agency IANS has added that more members may be added to the Oversight Committee too.

In a few hours she and several other top Indian wrestlers would be part of the biggest protest by Indian athletes against sports administrators in recent memory.

But as they placed mattresses around the pavement at a site that has been demarcated as a venue for protests in New Delhi, the 28-year-old says she was a little underwhelmed. “It’s not like we had any knowledge of what to expect. We didn’t even know exactly what you were supposed to do at a protest. I had heard about Jantar Mantar on TV. I knew that’s where people go to protest in Delhi, but I didn’t even know exactly where it was,” the two time World medallist tells Sportstar.

“I actually had this image in my head that we were going to be on some sort of stage and giving bhashan (speeches) like a politician. Then on the first day I saw that we were going to be protesting on the pavement. I realised we weren’t even carrying microphones. Luckily we had got some mattresses,” she says.

On that first day of what would be a three-day long sit in, Vinesh sat next to Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, World medallists Sarita Mor and Anshu Malik, junior world champion Sonam Malik and Asian medallist Jitender Kumar.

At this stage, there was still little to mark out the wrestlers’ protest from the dozens that routinely go on at Jantar Mantar. The wrestlers shared space on that first day with striking aanganwadi workers from Kerala and a group of nurses who had been laid off from their jobs in New Delhi hospitals.

Prior to arriving at Jantar Mantar though, Vinesh alongside Sakshi and Bajrang had sent out identical social media posts that read “Athletes win medals for the nation with their hard work but the federation doesn’t do anything but try to bring them down. Players are being harassed by imposing arbitrary laws.” The posts also had the hashtag #boycottWFIpresident.

As word spread of some of India’s most accomplished athletes on the road in New Delhi, media began to trickle in, the wrestlers were tight lipped only saying they were protesting against what they termed the dictatorial nature of the Wrestling Federation and the WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh who had been in that position since 2011. They only said they would speak at 4 p.m. that day with the promise that what they said would create a ‘ dhamaka’ (explosion).

It was as they said. At 4 p.m. the wrestlers accused Federation officials and coaches of financial impropriety, unsympathetic planning and mental harassment. They’d then drop the biggest bombshell of all, accusing the Federation President and national camp coaches of sexual exploitation ( yaun shoshan) of female athletes going back a decade. The accusations — particularly of exploitation — against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a powerful Member of Parliament from the ruling BJP who had won the WFI elections uncontested three times — were particularly seismic. They took the protest beyond purely a sporting one.

It is however learned that it wasn’t the alleged harassment that had been the sole breaking point for the athletes. According to Vinesh, anger had been building up for a long time. “There wasn’t that something happened to me or anyone and we decided to protest. But things had been getting intolerable,” she says.

In Vinesh’s case the immediate trigger had been the federation’s initial refusal to include her at the national camp and the first international competition of the season — the Croatia Ranking Series in the first week of February. Ostensibly Vinesh had been excluded since she didn’t participate in the national championships — something that the Federation had mandated for all athletes last year. Vinesh’s reasoning though was also not without merit — she had been injured at the world championships (where she had won a bronze) just a few months earlier. Vinesh had requested for an exemption. Just a few days before the start of the protest, Vinesh had to plead her case for inclusion before a government panel. This was ultimately granted.

This wasn’t the first time Vinesh and other senior athletes had been made to run through hoops. “Each of us had our own problem. Each of us had been dealing with something. Everyone was being troubled in some way,” says Vinesh.

Apart from not being called up for camps, there was disagreement over coaching. The Federation had banned Surjeet Mann — Bajrang’s coach for the previous year — from the camp owing to disciplinary charges after he had stepped onto the mat at the 2022 nationals following a disagreement with a referee’s decision. After the Tokyo Olympics, the WFI ended the contracts of all foreign coaches working privately with wrestlers. This affected Bajrang (coached by Shako Bentinidis), Vinesh (coached by Woller Akos) and Ravi Dahiya (coached by Kamal Malikov).

Akos’ exit was particularly bitter with the highly-rated Hungarian coach accused by the WFI president of misusing funds. “It was so humiliating. With what face could we go and ask someone to work with us again?” Vinesh says.

Then there was the question of what was seen as meddling by the federation in commercial partnerships the wrestlers had. At the start of last year, wrestlers in India were sponsored by multiple entities. Over the last year, the WFI had got into a partnership with one of them and had been pressing wrestlers signed by other contractors to sign with the first. The WFI also made it clear that all sponsorships were to be channelled through them alone.

The decision to protest was made at a meeting in Sonepat, just a day before the wrestlers actually gathered in Jantar Mantar. Only a few senior wrestlers who were present on the opening day knew about it. “The more people knew about this, the more chances of it being leaked. And we also knew we had to be there together. In the past we had heard that one or two had come forward but they got cowed down,” Vinesh says.

Once they showed up at Jantar Mantar though, the protesters wondered whether they were up for what they were going to talk about. “It wasn’t embarrassing to be sitting on the ground. We have come from the ground only ‘mitti’. Slowly as the media gathered, we started getting a little nervous on whether we were up for this. Everyone was scared. Everyone knows what he (WFI President) is capable of doing. We came in knowing that we would be as good as dead if this protest didn’t work out,” Vinesh says.

That was because of all the complaints they planned to bring up, it was the issue of sexual harassment that was the most emotive. It was also one that many female wrestlers were particularly wary of addressing. “You have to understand the background of these girls. They are mostly from rural families where such issues mean beizzati (loss of honour). It’s not so easy to come up and say all this happened to me. Because then you will have to face people who will say this is what will happen when you wanted to play sports,” says an individual associated with the protesters and didn’t want to be named.

Back in 2012, an official complaint of harassment had been made against a male coach by girls at the junior national camp in Lucknow. This particular coach was initially suspended and the matter was investigated by a SAI (Sports Authority of India) committee. However no final report was made after one of the complainants withdrew her accusation and claimed her signature on the complaint was forged.

According to those at the protest, this was one of the reasons why the accusations were only made some way into the first day’s press conference, after issues of financial impropriety and lack of coaching support were raised.

It was finally Vinesh who broached the topic. “Everyone was wondering who would be the first to speak up,” she says. “It’s not like no one knew what was going on in the camps. It was to protect girls that parents would come with them to the camp. But the problem was the trouble was happening outside India as well. Paap ka ghada bhar chuka tha. (Vessel of sin had become full already). Everyone was aware of it, but no one had the courage to say something. I am happy that I had the courage to step forward and tell the truth,” Vinesh says.

According to a source close to another athlete who wasn’t present at the protest and asked not to be named, some of the harassment was done with the promise of favours, international tours and sponsorships. “I am a strong-willed girl, so I was never going to be swayed. But there are so many girls who don’t have that ability to say no,” says Vinesh.

The wrestlers also found support from athletes from other disciplines - like boxer Vijender Singh (who is also Congress party member), who joined the wrestlers at Jantar Mantar. | Photo Credit: PTI

Even Vinesh wasn’t sure about speaking out until she thought of a young relative who wants to take up wrestling. “My career is anyway established. But I was thinking about the juniors. I have a young relative who is just starting to wrestle. I was thinking about her. I might have come through what had happened but if nothing changed, the system would just eat her alive,” Vinesh says.

The protests gathered steam following the allegations. As the protests continued, more wrestlers joined from the akhadas in the capital as well as towns around Delhi. The wrestlers got more comfortable with sitting in public. “At first we were nervous about what to expect but that went away. Some people were wondering if we were embarrassed to sit on the ground in front of everyone but we have all started our pehelwani in mitti (the driven earth in which traditional kushti is played ). So we were returning to that,” says Vinesh.

With police permission given for the protest between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. each day, the wrestlers spent as much time as they could at the protest site. Women wrestlers used a Sulabh toilet complex some 50 metres away from the site where they would change their clothes and freshen up. Other non-worldly support came a little further away. “There is a famous Hanuman temple in Janpath. We go and pray in the morning but before that we manage to take a bath at the premises,” said Asian medallist Jitender Kumar.

While simply taking the first step to protest had been a major step for many, it was not enough to get what they wanted — the resignation of the WFI president. With Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh denying the charges and refusing to step aside, the matter was at loggerheads. On the second day, the players said they would seek the registry of an FIR regarding their accusation of harassment if their demands were not met over the next few hours but that deadline came and went.

Meanwhile there was a push back from the other side. Several female wrestlers made videos — some obviously coached — where they spoke in favour of Sharan Singh. Others pointed out that the most serious accusation of harassment was brought up far later than other charges. Others pointed out that one of the protesters — Sakshi Malik was a member of the WFI’s own sexual harassment committee. Others wondered what was the role of Babita Phogat, a member of the ruling BJP who is also Bajrang’s sister-in-law and Vinesh’s cousin. Babita had showed up on the second day and said she was speaking to the government on the players’ behalf.

“People are going through what we spoke. Dissecting everything we spoke. But we never prepared how we were going to speak. None of us have trained for this. We are wrestlers, we barely know how to speak and put our point forward. We hadn’t planned anything. We hadn’t spoken to any lawyers. We just assumed that people will believe us. Why would we risk our careers if we didn’t believe what we were saying was the truth,” says Vinesh.

In the meantime, the Ministry of Sports got involved. On the first day of the protest, the Ministry issued a letter to the WFI, requiring them to answer the charges put forward by the protesting athletes within three days. The players met representatives of the Ministry of sports on the second day without resolution and then went to the home of the Sports Minister Anurag Thakur later that night. It is learned that several women athletes repeated their claims of harassment at that meeting. However that meeting, too, ended without a solution.

It was only on the night of the third day that the deadlock was broken. The Sports Minister addressed a meeting with five others — Bajrang, Vinesh, Sakshi, Ravi and Babita.

The minister stated that Brij Bhushan would step aside for a month while a five-member oversight committee would investigate the charges. In turn Bajrang said the protest would be called off.

A day later the WFI assistant secretary Vinod Tomar was also removed from his post. While that and the suspension of the activities of the federation seems to be a step forward, it also raises several other questions says Supreme court lawyer Rahul Mehra. “There’s no doubt the government has the right to suspend the working of the federation if there is violation of the National Sports Code. You have to specify what is the specific violation and then you can proceed with the suspension. Ideally it is through a show cause notice. Once the reply is not satisfactory you can derecognise the body,” he says.

Mehra raises the specific example of the WFI’s own sexual harassment committee. “What is most problematic is the fact that the WFI’s internal complaints committee on sexual abuse violates the Vishakha guidelines. This is in direct violation of the National Sports Code 2011 which obliges federations to implement it. In such a situation, the intervention of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and IOA is necessary,” says Mehra.

According to the Vishakha Guidelines for Cases of Sexual Harassment of Women at workplace, the chairperson of this committee has to be a woman and more than half of the members of the committee will also be women.

None of this though was followed in the WFI’s committee, notes Mehra.

But there is another issue says Mehra. “While there was a clear violation of the code, the Ministry has been looking the other side. In this case it was the MP from the ruling party so there was no question of derecognising or suspending this body. The problem with the violations of all these issues is not so much in the federation who are anyway at fault but with the Government of India and Ministry of sport which has chosen to look the other way,” says Mehra.

As it stands the WFI has still not been derecognised or suspended. Neither has the WFI president stepped down — he has merely ‘stepped away’ from handling the day-to-day functions of the federation. While the five-member committee has said they would speak to the alleged victims of harassment, there have been questions raised on the neutrality of the committee which is headed by Olympic medallist Mary Kom — who was elected to the Rajya Sabha by the the ruling party. Another member — Olympic medallist Yogeshwar Dutt — has also contested State elections on a BJP ticket and had also raised the possibility of the allegations being fake.

“When the matter is of such a magnitude, you want the committee to be as neutral as possible and one in which the athletes will have complete confidence in testifying to. This doesn’t seem like that,” says Mehra.

Indeed it is learned that at least one wrestler who says she was harassed and was initially adamant she would tell her story has now taken a step back. The prospect of public scrutiny and a potentially long media trial, she says, has caused her to change her mind.

Union Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Anurag Thakur along with wrestlers Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sakshee Malikkh, Babita Phogat and Ravi Kumar Dahiya addresses a joint press conference regarding the wrestlers‘ protest against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and its chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The protest was called off after this meeting. | Photo Credit: ANI

The protesting wrestlers, too, said that they were not taken into confidence by the government when the committee was being formed and asked the government to include two members of their choice, one of whom it is learned was Babita Phogat. On January 31, a week and a half after first announcing the formation of the oversight committee, the Sports Ministry did finally include Babita Phogat.

While she had once hoped for a quick resolution, Vinesh doesn’t regret going down this path. “It’s not as if I’m sleeping well. In fact I’ve been barely able to sleep since the first day. But the arrow has already left the bow and now there’s nothing else to do but see whether it hits the target,” she says.

The wrestlers themselves have made their peace with the knowledge that the battle will be a long one. Vinesh, who had initially been upset over not being included in the team for the Croatia Ranking Series, has pulled out of the competition. Bajrang, Ravi Dahiya and Sakshi have done the same as well. “Initially we had protested because it was a question of our wrestling careers. But now we know that the matter is much bigger than that. Our wrestling career is not the first priority right now,” says Vinesh.

Vinesh says alongside the messages of support there have been those, including some close to her, who question the wisdom in going up against a powerful politician.

“Even now we have family members telling us maybe we shouldn’t have done this. There is so much at stake here. But there was no option but to go ahead. At the end of this only one of us — us or Brij Bhushan is going to be standing. But regardless of what happens, at least there will be a sense of fear in people so that all that had happened doesn’t happen again”.

Nervousness has given way to wry humour. Vinesh compares the situation to that of a wrestling competition. “He (WFI president) thought athletes would never speak up. Normally what are we in comparison to a big neta (politician ). Agaryeh competition hota, he must have seen us and thought he was in an easy bracket. He thought he had a bye. He didn’t realise he was up against us,” she says.

WRESTLERS’ PROTEST: A TIMELINE: On January 18, 2023, several of India’s top wrestlers sat on a public protest in New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar against the Wrestling Federation of India and it’s president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The protesters raised several issues from sexual exploitation of women athletes, mental harassment, death threats as well as the poor planning of competition and training. The protests eventually led to the government to appoint an oversight committee to look into the charges, take charge of the functioning of the WFI and also have Brij Bhushan Sharan step aside from the day to day working of the organisation.

Problems between the players and the WFI had been simmering for several years and had surfaced publicly on a few occasions. Here is a look back:","At this stage, there was still little to mark out the wrestlers’ protest from the dozens that routinely go on at Jantar Mantar.
Just a few days before the start of the protest, Vinesh had to plead her case for inclusion before a government panel.
The decision to protest was made at a meeting in Sonepat, just a day before the wrestlers actually gathered in Jantar Mantar.
Others pointed out that one of the protesters — Sakshi Malik was a member of the WFI’s own sexual harassment committee.

Deol's headquarters is at Khojewal village where he has a big church, while Barjinder has his church near Chandigarh and also in Jalandhar, apart from branches at different places.Income-tax officials landed at Deol's church and house at Khojewal, located on the Jalandhar-Kapurthala road, in the morning. The raid was continuing till evening. A separate team along with security personnel of CRPF reached Barjinder's church at Tajpur on the Jalandhar-Nakodar road.Barjinder's church has been mired in controversy in the past too. In September, a four-year-old cancer patient had come to the church in Tajpur in the hope of getting cured, but she died at the church itself when the pastor was holding a prayer and healing session. Her family had claimed that doctors at AIIMS, Delhi, had given up on treating the girl and they had been coming to the church for nine months.Sources said the action had also been carried out at Kapurthala, Jalandhar and New Chandigarh. At present, I-T officials are assessing documents, property papers and bank accounts. It is unclear whether the department has come across any specific discrepancies. Action was still on when this report was filed. Officials of the I-T department refused to divulge any information about the raids.The two pastors have also been accused of practising exorcism and claiming miraculous cure for chronic, serious diseases.

Brady — the most successful quarterback in NFL history, and one of the greatest athletes in team sports — posted the announcement on social media Wednesday morning, a brief video lasting just under one minute.

“Good morning guys. I’ll get to the point right away,” Brady says as the message begins. “I’m retiring. For good.”

He briefly retired after the 2021 season, but wound up coming back for one more year with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He retires at age 45, the owner of numerous passing records in an unprecedented 23-year career.

Truly grateful on this day. Thank you 🙏🏻❤️ pic.twitter.com/j2s2sezvSS — Tom Brady (@TomBrady) February 1, 2023

A year ago when he retired, it was in the form of a long Instagram post. But about six weeks later, he decided to come back for one more run. The Buccaneers — with whom he won a Super Bowl two seasons ago — made the playoffs again this season, losing in their playoff opener. And at the time, it begged the question about whether Brady would play again.

Only a couple weeks later, he has given the answer.

“I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning, I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first,” Brady says in the video. “I won’t be long-winded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay and I used mine up last year.

“I really thank you guys so much, to every single one of you for supporting me. My family, my friends, teammates, my competitors. I could go on forever. There’s too many. Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn’t change a thing. Love you all.”

Brady is the NFL’s career leader in yards passing (89,214) and touchdowns (649). He’s the only player to win more than five Super Bowls and has been MVP of the game five times.

Famously underrated coming into the NFL — he was picked 199th in the 2000 draft by the Patriots, behind six other quarterbacks, three kickers and a punter — Brady certainly wasn’t expected to become synonymous with greatness. He played in one game as a rookie, completing one of three passes for six yards.

The next year, it all changed.

Brady took over as the Patriots’ starter, the team beat the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl that capped the 2001 season, and he and New England coach Bill Belichick were well on their way to becoming the most successful coach-QB duo in football history.

More Super Bowl wins came after the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The Patriots returned to football’s mountaintop for a fourth time in Brady’s era a decade later to cap the 2014 season, the start of three more titles in a span of five years.

In 2020, he joined the Buccaneers and won his seventh Super Bowl. He spent his last three years with Tampa Bay, getting them to the playoffs in each of those seasons.

“I think I’ve been on the record dozens of times saying there’s no quarterback I’d rather have than Tom Brady, and I still feel that way,” Belichick said in 2021 — shortly before Tampa Bay, with Brady, came to New England and beat the Patriots in a game dubbed “The Return.” “I was very lucky to have Tom as the quarterback, to coach him, and he was as good as any coach could ever ask for.”

Brady has won three NFL MVP awards, been a first-team All-Pro three times and selected to the Pro Bowl 15 times.

Brady and supermodel Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce this past fall, during the Bucs’ season. It ended a 13-year marriage between two superstars who respectively reached the pinnacles of football and fashion.

Farah, who won the Chicago Marathon in 2018 and is also the national record holder in the marathon, missed the London Marathon last year when he was forced to withdraw due to injury.

“I was really disappointed to miss last October’s London Marathon because of injury but I’m so happy the event has returned to April for 2023 as I don’t have to wait a whole year to get another chance,” Farah, who won 5,000 metres and 10,000m gold in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, said in a statement.

“The London Marathon has always been special to me and I am looking forward to being back out there on the roads of my home town.”

Farah will be joined by reigning Commonwealth Games 10,000 metres champion Eilish McColgan, who also withdrew ahead of her debut last year due to a medical issue. The 32-year-old is the daughter of the 1996 winner Liz McColgan.

“It was disappointing not to have taken part in last year’s London Marathon. I had such a fantastic summer on the track and the plan was always to follow that with my marathon debut in London,” the 2021 Birmingham Games gold medallist said.

“But I have been able to take further time to fully prepare for running a marathon and April will come around very quickly so I am extremely excited.

The committee was given a four-week deadline to complete its investigation into the allegations of sexual exploitation, intimidation, harassment and financial irregularities of the Federation and its president. However, halfway through, there are no signs of the committee having made any progress. Meanwhile the wrestlers whose protests led to the investigation have been vocal in their criticism of the committee's composition on their social media.

Wrestlers vs WFI: How the protest built up over months

There have been signs of further tension between the athletes and the administration, and there is also some concern over the staging of the Asian Wrestling Championships, scheduled to take place in New Delhi from March 28.

A top wrestler who was part of the protest says that the committee has not shared any updates with them. The wrestlers have also not been told whether the Asian Championships will go ahead.

Committee composition

On January 23, Sports Minister Anurag Thakur announced the scope of the five-member Oversight Committee. The committee is headed by Mary Kom and includes former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, ex-badminton player and Mission Olympic Cell member Trupti Murgunde, ex-TOPS CEO Rajesh Rajagopalan and former SAI executive director (Teams) Radhica Sreeman.

It should be noted that the committee had no representative from the legal fraternity or a neutral person from outside the system - all five members were from within the sporting system. Given the nature of charges, it would be expected to function almost as a POSH committee, and so should have had some legal and outside representation.

Additionally, Mary Kom is an MP nominated by the BJP, and so is essentially Brij Bhushan's colleague, while Dutt is very closely aligned with the party and had sided with the administration during the protests.

In response, Bajrang, Vinesh, and Sakshi Malik tweeted that, despite being given assurances, the government did not consult them before forming the committee.

This resulted in a change and former wrestler Babita Phogat was included in the committee. It is believed that the protesting wrestlers wanted her on the committee, but the criteria for her addition are unclear.

Meanwhile, a similar committee appointed by the Indian Olympic Association seems to have disbanded, ceding the probe to the Sports Ministry.

In their first action since taking over, the committee named the Indian contingent (11 Greco-Roman, 13 male freestyle and 12 women wrestlers) for the Zagreb Open Grand Prix. Top wrestlers including Ravi Dahiya, Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat pulled out of the event by stating they were not competition-ready.

As things stand, there are still a number of administrative and investigative questions left. India are hosts of the Asian Championship, which will decide the seeding for the World Championship later this year, which will serve as a Paris Olympics qualifier. The committee has to not only decide the logistics for it but also how the Indian squad will be chosen. This usually requires trials in advance, which means the wrestlers have to start preparing.

Even as the Oversight Committee balances both the probe and the administration, Indian wrestling remains in a limbo.","A top wrestler who was part of the protest says that the committee has not shared any updates with them.

Revealed: Why wrestlers have resumed their protest against WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh · Asian Games 2022: List of Indian athletes to have...,None,"Tennis: Nick Kyrgios pleads guilty to assaulting ex-girlfriend, escapes conviction","Tennis

The charge was for an incident in 2021.

Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios has admitted to assaulting an ex-girlfriend but avoided a criminal conviction with the magistrate calling the incident “a single act of stupidity or frustration.” It was reported back in 2021 that World No. 20 had shoved his ex-girlfriend Chiara Passari after a heated argument. Later Krgyios pleaded to the court to remove the charges against him citing mental health issues.

Magistrate Beth Campbell heard his plea and said that the matter is not grave therefore the charges can be dropped.

Campbell said Kyrgios acted poorly but the offense was not planned or pre-meditated. It was a “single act of stupidity” by a young man attempting to extricate himself from a tense situation. Kyrgios was s2aid to have shoved Passari, who was preventing him from leaving her Canberra apartment. Campbell described the incident as an act of ‘stupidity’ and ‘frustration’.

Krygios showed a deep sense of regret as he said, ‘I respect today’s ruling and am grateful to the court for dismissing the charges without conviction. I was not in a good place when this took place and I reacted to a difficult situation in a way I deeply regret. I know it wasn’t OK and I’m sincerely sorry for the hurt I caused.’

Kyrgios ex-girlfriend Passari reported this incident in early February almost a month after the incident had originally happened. The couple initially put it behind them and moved on. However, they broke up later that year.

His lawyer claimed that Krygios had lawfully asked the woman to move away from his car. 3‘It is in that context and the frustration that resulted, that my client reacted and the offense occurred,” Kukulies Smith added.

The lawyer later added that the incident was ‘a relationship between the mental health and the offending – even though he no longer suffers it to the same extent today.’

Sam Borenstein said that the tennis player suffers from recurrent mental health issue and thoughts of self-harm.

After listening to the entire account, the magistrate said,’ I am dealing with you in the same way I would deal with any young man in this court. You are a young man who happens to hit a tennis ball particularly well.’

Krygios finished second in Wimbledon 2022. He had to pull out of the recently finished Australian Open due to a knee injury.

WASHINGTON: US-China relations, already edgy over a range of issues, is in danger of deflating further after the Pentagon said it has detected a surveillance balloon over Montana, a state that is home to some of America's most lethal nuclear Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICMBs).US officials said Thursday that the military has been tracking the spy balloon for several days and has even considered shooting it down, but a decision on this has been deferred in the interest of public safety.The balloon is traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic, and in its current state, it ""does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,” officials said.The disclosure, coming just days before Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to visit Beijing, threatens to aggravate an already fraught relationship between the two countries.Chinese infiltration of US on the ground and now in the air has stirred disquiet in both strategic and political circles. US lawmakers and military analysts have been warning about proposed Chinese land purchases in neighboring North Dakota, saying it could be cover for spying on a nearby military facility where drone test flights are conducted.Some US lawmakers and officials, notably Florida governor Ron DeSantis have even suggested Chinese entities should be banned from buying American real estateCanada, which also tracked the Chinese spy balloon -- and suggested there was a second one -- has gone so far as to ban foreigners from buying real estate to cool prices. Chinese homebuyers accounted for nearly one-third of Vancouver's real estate market in 2015, according to a report by the National Bank of Canada.America is looking to follow suit.""We don't want to have holdings by hostile nations,"" DeSantis said last month, revealing that he is considering asking the Florida legislature to ban China from real estate investments.In Washington, leaders of a House select committee on China, issued a joint statement saying “the Chinese Communist Party should not have on-demand access to American airspace.”“Not only is this a violation of American sovereignty, coming only days before Secretary Blinken’s trip to China, but it also makes clear that the [Chinese Communist Party’s] recent diplomatic overtures do not represent a substantive change in policy,” lawmakers Mike Gallagher (R) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D) said, adding the incident demonstrates that the threat posed by China “is not confined to distant shores — it is here at home and we must act to counter this threat.”President Biden reportedly sought military options after being briefed on the incursion, but was told the Pentagon had acted immediately to prevent collection of sensitive information.Senior military officers, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reportedly advised against shooting down the balloon -- said to be the size of three buses -- citing concerns that falling debris could put people and property at risk.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China was assessing the situation and that speculation and hype were unhelpful while facts were still being clarified.“China is a responsible country that always abides by international law and has no intention of infringing on any country’s territory and airspace,” Mao said.But American officials said the U.S. intelligence community has ""very high confidence"" the balloon belongs to China, and Washington has engaged with Chinese officials ""with urgency, through multiple channels"" on the matter.""We have communicated to them the seriousness with which we take this issue. We have made clear we will do whatever is necessary to protect our people and our homeland,"" a senior military general told journalists at a background briefing.US officials acknowledged China has been undertaking similar activity spanning a period of “several years” mainly over US territories such as Hawaii and Guam in the Pacific.","Pentagon tracking Chinese ‘spy balloon’ spotted in US skiesWASHINGTON: US-China relations, already edgy over a range of issues, is in danger of deflating further after the Pentagon said it has detected a surveillance balloon over Montana, a state that is home to some of America's most lethal nuclear Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICMBs).US officials said Thursday that the military has been tracking the spy balloon for several days and has even considered shooting it down, but a decision on this has been deferred in the interest of public safety.The balloon is traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic, and in its current state, it ""does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,” officials said.The disclosure, coming just days before Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to visit Beijing, threatens to aggravate an already fraught relationship between the two countries.Chinese infiltration of US on the ground and now in the air has stirred disquiet in both strategic and political circles.

The statement said more details would be provided later on Friday.

“The news today that Ford is coming to Formula One from 2026 is great for the sport and we are excited to see them join the incredible automotive partners already in Formula One,” Formula One Chief Executive Stefano Domenicali said in the statement.

Ford sold their Jaguar branded team to Red Bull in 2004 and the current champions are still based at the same factory in central England.

The blue oval last appeared in Formula One with Jordan in 2004 but the company remains the sport’s third most successful engine manufacturer of all time.

“This is the start of a thrilling new chapter in Ford’s motorsports story that began when my great-grandfather won a race that helped launch our company,” said executive chairman Bill Ford.

“Ford is returning to the pinnacle of the sport, bringing Ford’s long tradition of innovation, sustainability and electrification to one of the world’s most visible stages.”

Formula One will have a new power unit from 2026 using 100% sustainable fuels and a greater electrical component.

Ford’s announcement comes after rival General Motors and their Cadillac brand teamed up with Andretti Autosport who are seeking to enter Formula One as an 11th team.

In Uttar Pradesh, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is known as a bahubali neta (muscleman leader). Riding high on the politics of mandal-kamandal (metaphorically, caste and religion) that raged in Uttar Pradesh in the 1990s, Singh was first elected to the Lok Sabha on a BJP ticket from Gonda in 1991. A strongman with a criminal history, he served as an MP for six terms, five times for the BJP and once for the Samajwadi Party (SP).

In Gonda district, Singh’s supporters spanning caste groups consider him a guardian angel because of the development work he has done in his constituency.

But the recent allegations by the wrestlers have brought him under the scanner: a viral video shows him coming out of the gym accompanied by at least 20 people while in another video from December 2021, he can be seen slapping a wrestler during the Under-15 National Wrestling Championship tournament in Ranchi.

Although the WFI head has stepped down for the time being, the BJP will probably go easy on Singh now, with the general election just a year away.

Singh, a law graduate of Avadh University, was elected to the Lok Sabha from Balrampur in 2004. However, in 2008, he quit the BJP and joined the Samajwadi Party. He won the Kaiserganj seat on the SP ticket in 2009, but in the lead-up to the 2014 parliamentary election, he rejoined the BJP and won the same seat once more.

“Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is a strong figure with significant swaying power in the Gonda-Balrampur area. Before acting against him, the party [BJP] will consider all those factors,” said a prominent Lucknow-based journalist.

Before Bollywood films like Dangal (2016) brought women wrestlers to the public eye, wrestling was primarily seen as a male sport with a few female wrestlers gracing the sidelines. In the last decade or so, however, women wrestlers have been winning championships, locally and internationally— Dangal merely gave them the spotlight they had long been denied. In recent years, they have been feted not just as athletes but also as stars. But if their recent allegations of sexual misconduct against people in power at the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) are any indication, their celebrity has not saved them from exploitation.

On the bitterly cold morning of January 18, several top wrestlers including Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik and 2022 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat protested at Delhi’s Jantar Matar against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the president of the WFI, accusing him of sexual misdemeanour and of being “autocratic”. They raised issues of financial irregularity in the WFI, saying they would not put up with the way Singh, a BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj, was running the organisation.

Interestingly, the women wrestlers were joined by World Wrestling Championship medallist Bajrang Punia, and Mahavir Phogat, coach and father of wrestlers Geeta and Babita Phogat. Wrestlers Sarita Mor, Sangeeta Phogat, Satyawart Malik, Jitender Kinha, and Sumit Malik were also present. They demanded the dissolution of the WFI and its reconstitution with a sportsperson at its head. The protest went on until January 20: it was called off after Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Anurag Thakur promised the wrestlers that an oversight committee would be formed to investigate the matter.

“It has taken a lot of courage for us to come together and protest,” the wrestlers wrote in a letter to former athlete P.T. Usha, who is the head of Indian Olympic Association (IOA), and a Rajya Sabha member since 2022. The letter said that Singh had sexually harassed several young wrestlers and that on account of the mental torture she faced Vinesh Phogat felt suicidal after failing to bring home an Olympic medal. Speaking at the dharna, Vinesh said she knew “at least 10 to 20 girls” who had been sexually harassed at wrestling camps. Their identities have not been revealed as that might endanger their lives, she added.

In its defence, the WFI has claimed that the protesting athletes have a “hidden agenda”. Singh and his supporters have tried to give the protests a political colour by alleging that the wrestlers, all from Haryana, have the support of Haryana Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda. However, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar came out in defence of the athletes. “The safety of our women athletes is very important and we take it seriously. We will not let their morale down. All the issues raised by the athletes will be taken seriously,” he said.

Taking cognisance of the allegations, Anurag Thakur initially announced that a five-member oversight committee, headed by boxing legend M.C. Mary Kom, will investigate the charges against Singh and manage the day-to-day affairs of the WFI until the committee submits its report. Other members of the committee include Khel Ratna awardee Yogeshwar Dutt; executive council member, IOA, Trupti Murgunde; member, Mission Olympic Cell, Radhica Sreeman; and ex-Executive Director (teams), Sports Authority of India (SAI), Rajesh Rajagopalan. The constitution of the committee did not go down well with the protesters: Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Puniya, and Sakshi Malik, who spearheaded the protest, said they were not consulted before the formation of the committee.

So, on January 31, the Sports Ministry added Babita Phogat to the committee. Significantly, Kom was nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the BJP in 2016 and Yogeshwar Dutt joined the BJP in 2019. Dutt has publicly come out in support of Singh. Meanwhile, Singh, who stepped down temporarily as president of the WFI, denied all charges and declared himself “ready to be hanged” if even one female wrestler could establish the sexual harassment claim against him.

Similar cases

While complaints of sexual harassment are common in the Indian sports fraternity, investigations into them are often inadequate after initial responses. In May 2022, a prominent sports coach, P. Nagarajan, was accused of sexual harassment by a national-level runner in Chennai. The 19-year-old claimed that Nagarajan touched female athletes inappropriately while giving them physiotherapy and helping them with stretches. Two months after she filed her complaint, seven more athletes made similar allegations. Nagarajan now faces charges under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

The Indian women’s Under-17 football team’s assistant coach, Alex Ambrose, was accused of sexually abusing a young athlete in June 2022 when the team was training in Norway. Ambrose, who served as the head of scouting for the All India Football Federation (AIFF), was suspended and expelled from the camp. The 40-year-old former India striker sent the AIFF a legal notice while denying any misconduct.

After a rider reported sexual harassment during a training trip to Slovenia, India’s head cycling coach, R.K. Sharma, was punished with termination of contract even as the SAI opened an investigation into the issue. A few days after the initial complaint, Sharma was accused of harassing three other cyclists.

No resolution

Most of these cases have dragged on for years with no resolution in sight. Several times, the accused are let off with minor punishments ranging from transfers to meagre cuts in pay or pension.

A former SAI executive director who spoke to Frontline on condition of anonymity said that many girls who come from rural and impoverished backgrounds are coerced by senior officials into giving sexual favours on the basis of false promises. For these young female athletes, the stakes are high—a fact which probably ensures their silence.

Norris Pritam, a senior sports journalist who has covered six Olympic Games, told Frontline that while sexual harassment was quite prevalent in the world of sports, only a few cases got publicised.

“Only a minuscule section [of such incidents] gets reported because of fear of superiors, family pressure, and societal issues. I have met many women who have left promising careers because of sexual harassment,” he said.

Indian sports federations are still male-dominated, said Pritam. Even when the federations receive such complaints, they “mishandle them” and “nothing much comes out of the investigations and committees that are formed”. However, Pritam believes that the recent protest will at least encourage men and women to speak out. “It will also send out a message to officials and coaches, who should be alarmed,” he said.

““It has taken a lot of courage for us to come together and protest,” the wrestlers wrote in a letter to the head of Indian Olympic Association, P.T. Usha.”

K.P. Mohan, former sports editor of The Hindu, pointed out that over the decades sports activities have changed from being a hobby or passion to become a full-fledged industry involving money, sponsors, and advertisers, because of which they have come under political influence. Historically, too, the heads of sports federations in India have been either politicians or have strong ties with politics.

“Politicians who aren’t genuinely interested in a particular sport start heading it because it is a powerful position to be in. Muscle power has replaced genuine love for sports in recent times,” he said.

Vinesh was outspoken in her allegations at the press conference the protesters addressed: “This exploitation is happening every day. Why does the [training] camp happen in Lucknow? The reason it’s happening over there is because he [Singh] has a house there and so it’s easy to exploit the girls. They trouble us too much. They get into our personal lives and relationships. They want to know everything.”

No matter where the case ends, the wrestlers have spoken up fearlessly against powerful opponents and that in itself is a good start.

Addressing a rally in Bagbassa constituency, where the BJP has fielded Jadab Lal Debnath, Adityanath said, “The Congress protested against construction of the temple. They play with people’s sentiments. They raised questions on Lord Ram’s existence…”

Days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, while addressing rallies in the state, that the Ram Mandir would be completed and opened to the public by January 1, 2024, Adityanath said a magnificent temple is in its last stages of construction and would be completed soon.

Under the previous government of the CPI(M)-led Left Front, Adityanath said, there was little employment generation, people did not get benefits of government schemes, and women lacked security.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh at his residence.,2023-02-08 00:24:23+05:30,Jessica Pegula reveals her mother Kim Pegula’s health crisis,"Pro tennis player Jessica Pegula has revealed that her mother, Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres co-owner and president Kim Pegula, went into cardiac arrest in June and is still recovering while dealing with significant language and memory issues.

In an essay that The Players’ Tribune published Tuesday, Jessica Pegula detailed for the first time the medical crisis that abruptly removed her mother from the public eye and suggested that her mother may not resume the same level of involvement in the family’s sports franchises.

Kim Pegula, she wrote, went into cardiac arrest while sleeping and received lifesaving CPR from another daughter until paramedics arrived and restored her heartbeat. The family previously said only that Kim Pegula was receiving medical care for “some unexpected health issues” that arose shortly after she celebrated her 53rd birthday.

“My mom is working hard in her recovery, she is improving, but where she ends up is still unknown,” Jessica Pegula, 28, wrote.

She said she decided to write about her mother’s ordeal after Bills player Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest on the field during a Jan. 2 game in Cincinnati in what Pegula described as “some bizarre, messed-up, full circle moment.”

“My stomach sunk because it felt like the exact same thing all over again. I was sitting on the bench for a tennis event in Sydney, Australia. I wanted to throw up,” wrote Jessica Pegula, who is No. 4 in the WTA’s singles rankings. “I was supposed to go on for mixed doubles in 15 minutes and I remember telling one of my teammates, `I am a little freaked out right now, this is too close to home, and I feel like I am going to have a panic attack.’”

As Hamlin began his recovery, Jessica Pegula joined in an outpouring of support from fans and the NFL and wore a white screen-printed patch with Hamlin’s uniform number while playing at the Australian Open. “It didn’t feel like it was just for him, it felt like it was for my mom as well,” she said.

Jessica Pegula had been home in Florida months earlier when she got a call from her sister, Kelly, around midnight on their mother’s birthday and learned that their mother was being rushed to the hospital.

“My mom was asleep when my dad woke up to her going into cardiac arrest and she was unresponsive for quite a while,” she wrote. Kelly Pegula, who was staying with their parents, performed CPR — just three months after telling her family that she planned to become certified in the procedure for a job.

“I remember her telling us what she was doing in our family group chat,” Jessica Pegula wrote, “and my mom even responded, `Nice Kells! Now if we have a heart attack you can revive us.’”

Today, Kim Pegula “can read, write, and understand pretty well, but she has trouble finding the words to respond,” Jessica Pegula wrote. “It is hard to deal with and it takes a lot of patience to communicate with her, but I thank God every day that we can still communicate with her at all. The doctors continue to be blown away by her recovery, considering where she started, and her determination is the driving force of that.”

As the first woman to serve as president of an NHL and NFL team at the same time, Kim Pegula “lived it and loved it, and it was felt by everyone she met,” Jessica Pegula wrote. “Now we come to the realization that all of that is most likely gone. That she won’t be able to be that person anymore.”","Pro tennis player Jessica Pegula has revealed that her mother, Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres co-owner and president Kim Pegula, went into cardiac arrest in June and is still recovering while dealing with significant language and memory issues.

Singh became a race-walker in subsequent seasons and joined Indian Navy last year under the sports quota. On Tuesday, the 23-year-old became one of two Indian athletes, alongwith Priyanka Goswami, to bag the first qualifying berths for Paris Olympics with a new national record of one hour and 19.55 minutes in the men’s 20 km race walk event at the Tenth Indian Open Race Walking Championship at Ranchi.

“My father owns a two-acre farm in our village and my aim was to get enrolled in the army as a soldier and support my family. Seeing the elder village youth train for the recruitment drives, I spent my time running around the farm and later at the nearby stadium in an effort to prepare myself for the coming years. After making the national record today, I told my father about qualifying for the Paris Olympics and the first thing he asked me was, “Paise da arrangement karna hai tan das di (if you want money then tell me),” shared Singh while speaking with The Indian Express.

Singh’s interest in running grew with village youths passing his home in the morning to train in the fields or along the road to the nearby town of Barnala. The youngster would train for 800m races at the village apart from undertaking the 30-minute bus journey to the Baba Kehar Singh Stadium in Barnala. It was the transfer of his initial coach Jaspreet Singh that led to the Punjab youngster going to Patiala to train as an athlete. With his coach suggesting he train under former race walk national champion and coach Gurdev Singh, the youngster faced the dilemma of training as a runner or race walker.

“Kadhi kise nu eh khed karde dekhya hi nahi si (I had never watched any one competing in a race walk ever). When coach Gurdev Singh told me to train as a race walker in 2016, I did not even train with full effort for a month or so. I was fascinated by races and could not imagine myself walking,” remembers Singh.

Gurdev Singh, who has coached the likes of KT Irfan, who finished tenth in the London Olympics, was impressed by Singh’s natural walking action and persisted with training the youngster in race walk. While the veteran coach made Singh train for one-hour training sessions initially, the training sessions increased as well as his trainee’s willingness to continue in the discipline. “When I made Akshdeep give the race walk trials, I was impressed by the balance of his heel kick. For close to two months, he did not show his willingness but when he met some of the seniors and other athletes in the camp, his interest grew. His posture was good for race walking but we had to gradually work on the placement of knee and heel on the track as his muscles were trained for running. Slowly we made him run on the road and would increase the distance to 30-40 kms during one training session,” says Gurdev.

Singh won a silver medal in the U-18 Junior Nationals in Vijayawada with a timing of 43.35 minutes within an year of training and followed the medal with a silver in All India Inter-university the same year. In 2018, Singh clocked his first sub 43-minute timing of 42.36 minutes and won the bronze in 10km race walk in the Junior Federation Cup at Coimbatore. The youngster missed his chance to compete in Junior Asian Championship but made a new junior national record of 44.791 in 10 Km race walk event in Ranchi the same year.

In 2019, the youngster suffered a knee injury which kept him out for ten months, which also meant that he missed the World University Games in Italy. “The first race walk shoe I bought was for Rs 4500 and the shoes would break after 2-3 months. My father and mother would save whatever money they could and my coaches and seniors too helped me. When I broke the new junior national record, I had my passport made. Injury de karan passport bina kise vise di stamp toh reh gaya (Due to injury, my chance to get a visa stamp on passport remained unfulfilled,)” says Singh.

A Khelo India Scholarship kept his training needs fulfilled to some extent and the youngster competed in his first senior competition in 2020 where he gave his personal best 20 km race walk timing of one hour and 26.12 minutes to finish 11th in Eighth Indian Open Race Walking Competition in Ranchi days before Covid-19 lockdown.

The last two years have seen him making a new Khelo India University games record as well a bronze medal in National Games and a silver in Open Nationals in Bengaluru. Singh has also been training under Russian coach Tatyana Sibileva at Bengaluru. At the last Asian Games, the men’s 20 km race walk title went at the timing of one hour and 22.04 minutes and Singh believes that he can win a medal despite Chinese runners being in familiar territory.

Committing fewest fouls

“Race walking is all about committing less fouls and getting the technique perfect. Coach Tatyana has made us focus on hip and knee exercises and posture to make contact with the track as straight and maintain contact with track during all the times. She has made us train for long steps and a fast heel kick to make the heel balance. During my time at the village in lockdown, I also saw videos of world leader Perseus Karlstrom of Sweden, 2012 Olympic champion Chen Ding and 2016 Olympic champion Wang Zhen of China to observe their technique,” said Singh, who now works as a petty officer with the Indian Navy.

As for his village, Singh knows how the village will celebrate his feat of qualifying for the Paris Olympics. “My village is very proud of me and racewalking. Whenever there is a kabaddi mela at the village or nearby villages, they invite me to demonstrate race walking in the field so that more and more kids know about the sport. Jad sari duniya de samne chal kaiya fer pind de samne chalan di ki sharam (When I have walked in front of the world, why should I hesitate in walking in front of village kids),” says Singh.","“Kadhi kise nu eh khed karde dekhya hi nahi si (I had never watched any one competing in a race walk ever).

Mumbai City FC have taken a great leap this season.From fifth last season to champions now, it has been quite a transformation for Des Buckingham’s side. They conceded 31 goals last season and just 18 so far in the Indian Super League ( ISL ), despite introducing only one new foreign defender -- Royston Griffiths – to the starting lineup. Six of the goals, interestingly, came from their first game against Hyderabad FC (3-3) at home and the last one against FC Goa (5-3) at Fatorda.While defence has seen the biggest change, the goals from Indian wingers can hardly be ignored.Wingers Bipin Singh and Lallianzuala Chhangte have collectively been involved in 23 of Mumbai City FC’s 53 goals this season. While Chhangte has notched up ten goals and six assists to remain the top Indian goalscorer, Bipin has six goals and two assists in his bag.So how did Mumbai become unstoppable?“When the coach took charge, he spoke to us individually, but maybe (his plans) it did not immediately register with the players,” Bipin said on Monday. “In the second season, with the coach giving us the confidence (to perform), everyone understood what the coach wanted, what his game plan is. We can see the results on the field.”Bipin was an important player during Sergio Lobera’s time at the club and continues to set the wing on fire with his speed and ability to score important goals. He has scored 18 goals in the last three seasons and nine assists, quite a turnaround in fortunes for someone who had just four goals in his first three seasons in the top tier of Indian football.“Before joining Mumbai, I spent a year at ATK, having moved there from the I-League. This is my fifth year in Mumbai, it’s like home. My dream was to win the (ISL) trophy once. Three years after I joined, we won the Shield and Trophy. That felt great. To become champions again is a wonderful feeling,” said Bipin.","Panaji:Mumbai City FC have taken a great leap this season.From fifth last season to champions now, it has been quite a transformation for Des Buckingham’s side.

What Apple had to say

A recently reported Apple Maps bug was reportedly allowing apps to collect user location data without permission. Several apps could have exploited this privacy bug to their advantage. According to a report by 9to5Mac, a Brazilian food delivery app named iFood accessed a user’s location data in iOS 16.2 even after the user denied all location access to the app. The Cupertino-based tech giant started rolling out to the general public last month. Among other new features, the latest iOS version also included a list of security updates.The Apple Maps privacy bug that allowed an app to “bypass Privacy preferences” was also addressed by one of these fixes. The report also claims that the company has clarified that iPhone users “were never at risk” due to this security flaw. The company also denied the report regarding the Brazillian food delivery app accessing user locations without permission in iOS 16.2.As per the report, Apple has explained that the Maps vulnerability that was patched “could only be exploited from unsandboxed apps on macOS .” Moreover, the company added the fix to all of Apple’s software updates including iOS and iPadOS , tvOS, and watchOS. This was done by the company as the codebase is shared by all these operating systems.Apple has also claimed that “the suggestion that this vulnerability could have allowed apps to circumvent user controls on iPhone is false.” The company also concluded that the app was not circumventing user controls through any mechanism.” The Apple Maps security flaw was first discovered by an anonymous researcher.In a statement to 9to5Mac, Apple said, “At Apple, we firmly believe users should choose when to share their data and with whom. Last week we issued an advisory for a privacy vulnerability that could only be exploited from unsandboxed apps on macOS. The codebase that we fixed is shared by iOS and iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS, so the fix and advisory was propagated to those operating systems as well, despite the fact that they were never at risk. The suggestion that this vulnerability could have allowed apps to circumvent user controls on iPhone is false.A report also incorrectly suggested an iOS app was exploiting this or another vulnerability to bypass user control over location data. Our follow up investigation concluded that the app was not circumventing user controls through any mechanism.”","How iPhone users were not at riskWhat Apple had to sayA recently reported Apple Maps bug was reportedly allowing apps to collect user location data without permission.

It said much water has flown after that decision and the court at that time did not examine that Article 26(b), which talks about the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion, is also subject to morality.“For example, the narrow interpretation given to Article 21 in the ‘A K Gopalan era’ is no longer valid. The concept of freedom has undergone changes. In the 21st Century, society looks completely different from what it looked in the last century. We see a change in the socio-cultural ethos of society. Thus, the interpretation of law must keep pace with changing needs of society,” Justice Oka said.The court did not agree with the earlier Constitution bench verdict and said the issue needed to be decided by a larger bench. It held that excommunication or ostracisation is anathema to the concepts of liberty and equality and against anti-discriminatory ethos which forms a part of constitutional morality.“Even assuming that the excommunication of members of the Dawoodi Bohra community is always made on religious grounds, the effect and consequences thereof, on the person excommunicated needs to be considered in the context of justiciable constitutional rights.It said a person who is excommunicated by the community will not be entitled to use the community’s common property and its burial/cremation grounds. “In a sense, such a person will virtually become untouchable. In a given case, it will result in his civil death,” the court said.","In the 21st Century, society looks completely different from what it looked in the last century.

JALANDHAR: Launching a vitriolic attack on the Punjab government over claims that it had attracted an investment of Rs 40 ,000 crore besides giving jobs to 2.5 lakh youths, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday dared Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann to ""give names of 500 youth to whom jobs had been given"" by the claimed investment.“The CM is lying as no investment has come into the state. In fact, the industry is moving out to Uttar Pradesh and other States.

This is an outright lie. I challenge the chief minister to give names of 500 youths who have been given jobs with the claimed investment,” he said while interacting with media at Adampur ahead of the Jalandhar parliamentary bypoll.Criticising theg CM for asserting that the state governor could not ask him any questions because he was “selected” and not “elected”, Sukhbir said that (at the same time) the CM was allowing AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal to run the affairs of Punjab.He questioned the CM if Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia had been elected from Punjab that they were interfering in Punjab affairs as Sisodia framed the excise policy of the state.“Even Raghav Chadha, who has not been directly elected by Punjabis, is deciding on all civil and police postings,” Sukhbir said.Holding the CM responsible for the “constitutional crisis” in Punjab, the SAD leader said that the CM was refusing to answer governor's questions pertaining to corruption and illegal decisions.“After the government blocked queries from political parties and even RTI applications on certain issues, the parties approached the governor after which he asked the CM, "" he said.Maintaining that the SAD had always been a votary of federalism and was against central interference in the affairs of states, Sukhbir said, “However, many of the issues raised by the governor pertain to corruption and the AAP government should not shy away from coming clean on these issues of public welfare.”He also said that the SAD had approached governor Banwari Lal Purohit requesting him to make AAP accountable for all advertisements issued by the government outside Punjab in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat prior to the assembly elections there to recover the entire public money.","02:29 “Punjab missing from budget”: CM Bhagwant Mann01:03 Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann visits Bombay Stock Exchange for ceremonial ringing of the bellJALANDHAR: Launching a vitriolic attack on the Punjab government over claims that it had attracted an investment of Rs 40 ,000 crore besides giving jobs to 2.5 lakh youths, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday dared Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann to ""give names of 500 youth to whom jobs had been given"" by the claimed investment.“The CM is lying as no investment has come into the state.

Announcing his decision to strengthen the JKNPP in a video statement, Singh, who was the chairman of the AAP’s J&K Coordination Committee, said he has consulted his former JKNPP colleagues and decided to work towards reviving it. “Our ancestors had sacrificed a lot for this party,” he said, adding that its revival would be in the interest of the people.

Singh said he decided to leave the AAP as no one in the party was raising their voice over rising public problems on key issues like power, water, schools, ration and pension. Besides, the BJP was bringing new laws every day and foisting them on the people, whose lands were being snatched and houses demolished, he charged.

With old age pensions stopped and new guidelines made for widow’s pension in J&K, he claimed that new orders were being issued daily by the administration to harass the common man over the issuance of Aadhaar cards, new formats of Income Tax and domicile certificates, etc. He added that no political party was raising their voice against the BJP as all of them, barring the Panthers Party, have some “vested interests”. He went on to say that he has taken up the project of reviving the Panthers Party at the behest of the people as the JKNPP “is their only voice in the region”.

Singh, who had been elected MLA on the Panthers Party’s ticket from Ramnagar constituency in Udhampur district for three consecutive terms from 1996, had joined the AAP in May 2022, following on the defection of former JKNPP MLAs, Yash Pal Kundal and Balwant Singh Mankotia, to the

Arvind Kejriwal-led party. Like Singh, Kundal was also a former minister in the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed-led PDP-Congress coalition government, formed in 2002.

Singh and Mankotia are cousins. While Kundal is still with the AAP, Mankotia has switched to the BJP.

Amit Kapoor, a senior J&K AAP leader, who claimed he had brought Harsh Dev Singh into the party, alleged that the latter had resigned after the AAP high command had declined to grant him Rs 12 lakh per month to run the party’s affairs in the Union Territory. He added that Singh had raised the demand for money through one of his “gurney (supporters)” at the AAP meeting in Delhi on January 23. Kapoor added that Singh had unsuccessfully tried to convince the party leadership to scrap the existing AAP team and make him the party’s J&K chief. Singh was not available for comments on these allegations.

The JKNPP, recognised by the Election Commission, was founded by Bhim Singh in 1982 as a splinter outfit of the Indian National Congress. Bhim died on May 31, 2022, following which the party saw an exodus of senior leaders from its fold.

Bhim Singh had been elected MLA twice from Chenani – on a Congress ticket in 1977, and again in 1983 (at a time when elections were held in J&K every 6 years). He was later nominated to the Legislative Council too, during the Mufti Sayeed-led coalition government. He had also contested the 1997 Lok Sabha by-election from Udhampur, in which, despite leading by 30,000 votes at the end of counting, was declared to have lost in a repoll. The result was overturned by the J&K High Court after Singh challenged the decision.

After Bhim Singh’s death, the JKNPP split into two groups, one headed by P K Ganjoo, the other by Vilakshan Singh, his another nephew. Both factions have now filed their claims for recognition before the EC.

Vilakshan Singh said their efforts to bring back those who had left the party have yielded results, with the return of Harsh Dev Singh expected to boost the party further. Meanwhile, Hakikat Singh, general secretary of the Ganjoo-led faction, said theirs was a “duly elected group by the party’s working committee”.","Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Harsh Dev Singh on Thursday quit the party and returned to the J&K National Panthers Party (JKNPP), which he had quit in May last year, a few days before the death of its founder and his uncle Bhim Singh.

“After talking with my parents I understand how my coat could have offended some people,” Hamlin wrote in a note posted on his Twitter account. “It was never my intentions to hurt or disrespect anyone, the coat is abstract art to me.”

Hamlin closed his two-post thread by saying he will continue to learn from the situation while adding: “My beliefs and Relationship with God is not tied to symbolic images.”

The second-year player continues recovering after having to be resuscitated on the field after going into cardiac arrest during a game in Cincinnati six weeks ago created a stir for being pictured wearing a Kanye West Eternal Saint blue varsity jacket during pregame ceremonies and sitting in NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s box at the Super Bowl in Arizona on Sunday.

The back of the jacket featured an abstract illustration of Jesus on the cross under the word “ETERNAL.” The front featured an abstract depiction of Jesus’ face and appears to reference a Bible verse that reads: “Without end or beginning there is no day and no night.”

Among the critics were former NFL running back Adrian Peterson, who referred to the jacket as “blasphemy” on Monday.

A day later, Peterson wrote in an Instagram post that he has since cleared the air with Hamlin.

“After speaking with Damar, I have an understanding that it didn’t come from a place of ill intent,” Peterson wrote. “I apologize for offending you, I just felt offended in that moment as a man who loves and respects our Lord and Savior.”

“If I offended anybody in any way, shape or form, I’m sorry,” he added.

“It was not intended to be that way. We play pranks on one another all the time and virally I think this did not come across that way, but between us it was, it’s different.”

However four-time Olympic gold medallist Johnson saw right through the apology, saying that Woods is still heralded after all his mistakes and that media focus is always on his recovery, not why the need for recovery.

Johnson tweeted: “Apology starting with “If I offended anyone” is no apology. But this is Tiger. Never been a leader and he’s Teflon. Still heralded after all the mistakes so he’s learned nothing. Media focus always on miraculous recovery. Never why the need for recovery.”

Woods is playing in his first competitive PGA Tour event since missing the cut at The Open in July. The 15-time major champion was in a group with PGA Championship winner Thomas and four-time major winner Rory McIlroy for the first two rounds.

It’s not the first time that Woods and Thomas have been involved in controversial incidents in their careers.

Woods was involved in a car crash in November 2009 which eventually led to admissions of infidelity and the breakdown of his marriage. He then took a break from golf but returned shortly afterward.

In 2017 Woods was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence when he was found asleep at the wheel of his car. He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.

Apple Visual Look-Up feature on iPhone: Things to remember

Conclusion

Apple offers iPhone users a Google Lens-like feature that can recognise things from images. The Visual Look-Up feature works only with certain Apple apps on iPhones and can identify particular objects which include pets, art, landmarks and more. By using this feature, iPhone users can get more information about the subject in the image. The Cupertino-based tech giant has also recently posted a video on the Apple Support channel on YouTube to promote the feature. This new video also explains how this feature works and how users can access this feature on their iPhones.In a blog post, Apple has outlined some of the prerequisites needed to use this feature. The company has mentioned that iPhone users need to be iOS 15 or later to use the Visual Look Up feature. Meanwhile, iPad users have to run iPadOS 15.1 or later to access the feature. However, this feature is not available on all iPad models. Apple Visual Look-Up feature is available on -- iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) or later, iPad Pro 11-inch (all models), iPad Air (3rd generation) or later, iPad (8th generation) or later, or iPad mini (5th generation) or later.This feature works only with certain Apple apps which include Mail, Messages, Notes and others. In these apps, iPhone users have to tap and hold on an image and then tap on the info button. The info button is denoted by a lowercase ""i"" which is placed inside a circle with a sparkle. On tapping it, the feature will open the Safari browser to offer more info about the subject in the picture.In Safari, when users tap on the ""Look Up"" button in the options menu, another icon starts appearing inside or below the photo. For example, the image will get a paw icon for images of pets and animals or a leaf icon for flowers and plants. Users can tap on these icons to get more information about the image’s subject and other pictures of the same from the internet and Siri Knowledge .Users need to keep in mind that this feature will not be available for all images. If the ""i"" icon in a picture has a circle without a sparkle, it means that Visual Look Up is not available for that particular image.The feature works like a limited version of Google Lens which is also available for iPhone users via the Google app. Google Lens offers more information like sites from where you can buy a particular product and how much is it priced across different retailers. To take on Google Lens, Apple is expected to expand Visual Look Up in the coming days. Currently, the Apple feature is limited, while Google Lens is also powered by Search and Assistant.","How to use Visual Look Up on your iPhone | Apple SupportApple Visual Look-Up feature on iPhone: What do you needApple Visual Look-Up feature on iPhone: How to useApple Visual Look-Up feature on iPhone: Things to rememberConclusionApple offers iPhone users a Google Lens-like feature that can recognise things from images.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: With a hawk eye on China, the government has sanctioned seven new battalions of the Indo Tibetan Border Police ( ITBP ) which will come up in the next few years.India's decision to bolster its border security forces comes amid continous tensions with neighbour China that led to deadly border clashes in 2020 and scuffles late last year.The proposal was cleared during the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) that was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur told reporters during a post cabinet press briefing.The move is expected to increase the strength of the Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) to more than 10 per cent, according to reports.According to the government sanction, the fresh manpower will be utilised for manning 47 new border posts and a dozen 'staging camps' or troops bases to be created along this frontier, largely in Arunachal Pradesh.These bases were sanctioned in 2020, the same year Indian and Chinese troops were involved in one of the deadliest clashes in decades.A senior officer said that the new bases were sanctioned to ensure effective guarding of the LAC, adding that now seven battalions and a new sector headquarter comprising about 9,400 personnel have also been given a go-ahead.The battalions and the sector headquarter are expected to be put in place by 2025-26, Thakur said.He said a non-recurring expenditure of Rs 1,808.15 crore is estimated to be spent for land acquisition, creation of office and residential buildings, and arms and ammunition while a recurring annual expenditure of Rs 963.68 crore will be done under the salaries and rations head for the fresh manpower.Officials said the creation of 47 new border posts will lead to a 26 per cent increase in the strength of these bases while the induction of 9,400 fresh personnel will enhance its strength by 10 per cent. The force has 176 border posts at the LAC currently.The ITBP, which is about 90,000-personnel strong, was raised in the aftermath of the 1962 Chinese aggression.It is tasked with guarding the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) on India's eastern flank, stretching from the Karakoram Pass in Ladakh in India's north to Jachep La in Arunachal Pradesh state in the east.The force is working along with the Army at this front even as the militaries of India and China are engaged in a standoff at Ladakh from 2020.The CCS also gave its nod for the construction of a 4-km-long Shinkun La tunnel with an approach road with an aim of providing all-weather connectivity between Ladakh and the rest of the country.Providing details of the cabinet decision, Union minister Anurag Thakur said the tunnel will be completed by December 2025 at a cost of Rs 1,681 crore.""This (project) is also very important as far as the security and safety of the country is concerned.... It will also help in the movement of our security forces in that region,"" Thakur said.Before this, the Atal tunnel was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi linking Manali to Leh and it provides all-weather connectivity throughout the year, he said.","Most muscle along LACFrontier force along China borderNod to Shinkun La tunnel(With inputs from agencies)NEW DELHI: With a hawk eye on China, the government has sanctioned seven new battalions of the Indo Tibetan Border Police ( ITBP ) which will come up in the next few years.India's decision to bolster its border security forces comes amid continous tensions with neighbour China that led to deadly border clashes in 2020 and scuffles late last year.The proposal was cleared during the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) that was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur told reporters during a post cabinet press briefing.The move is expected to increase the strength of the Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) to more than 10 per cent, according to reports.According to the government sanction, the fresh manpower will be utilised for manning 47 new border posts and a dozen 'staging camps' or troops bases to be created along this frontier, largely in Arunachal Pradesh.These bases were sanctioned in 2020, the same year Indian and Chinese troops were involved in one of the deadliest clashes in decades.A senior officer said that the new bases were sanctioned to ensure effective guarding of the LAC, adding that now seven battalions and a new sector headquarter comprising about 9,400 personnel have also been given a go-ahead.The battalions and the sector headquarter are expected to be put in place by 2025-26, Thakur said.He said a non-recurring expenditure of Rs 1,808.15 crore is estimated to be spent for land acquisition, creation of office and residential buildings, and arms and ammunition while a recurring annual expenditure of Rs 963.68 crore will be done under the salaries and rations head for the fresh manpower.Officials said the creation of 47 new border posts will lead to a 26 per cent increase in the strength of these bases while the induction of 9,400 fresh personnel will enhance its strength by 10 per cent.

He had been admitted to a hospital there after sustaining a femur fracture from a fall. He was 78.Born in Dehradun on January 10, 1945, Jonathan Anthony Mason studied at La Martiniere for Boys and did his graduation and master’s in English from Jadavpur University. He taught English in La Martiniere before moving to St James’ where he became an institution himself. Mason had also written several text books in English.After retiring from a full-time teaching career, Mason had settled down in Dehradun and was working on a village project near Meerut. Mason and his wife Anjoo had gone to Kerala recently to visit his sister-in-law, the granddaughters of the freedom fighter and lawyer Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru . They returned via Pondicherry where he fell and broke his femur. Post-surgery complications led him to Chennai for treatment. He died there on Friday.St James’ School will hold a memorial service in memory of Mason on Monday. La Martiniere for Boys secretary Supriyo Dhar said the school also plans to offer a tribute to the academician.Academics recall how Mason had first instilled discipline shortly after he took over the reins of St James’ in 1978 and then went on to recruit several key teachers who turned around the school’s academic record and made it into one of the city’s foremost English medium schools. By the time he left the school in 1992, it was among the top ICSE schools in India.Students at St James’ recalled his flamboyance: he was always nattily dressed in a suit. “For many of us, he represented the quintessential Englishman. He even had blonde hair. He was like a principal from the English novels we read,” recounted ex-St James’ student Indranil Poddar .Mason was also famous for not putting up kindly with nuisance. He had a fundamental kindness but was always strict about academics. Students recall how he maintained a register on the academic record of all senior students in his office and consulted it when there was a complaint of indiscipline to check how the student’s academic record was.“Monday was inspection day. Anyone who was dressed well used to get plus points and those dressed poorly were given negative points,” recounted.","KOLKATA: Educationist John Mason , who headed several schools during his career, including St James ’ School, the Doon School, and Modern High School in Dubai, died in Chennai on Friday.

In its ‘Khorasan Ghag’ magazine, ISKP has claimed that Pakistan is run by ""an establishment which follows instructions from the United States.""To buttress the claim, it cited the example of Imran Khan's ascension to, and ousting from power. It said Khan was brought into power through rigging and removed after he visited Russia. It added that Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir's recent visit to US was to ""take orders.""It has vowed to continue working against the Pakistani state and keep up its own agenda of jihad against ""US agents.""The magazine also dedicated substantial space to a recent confrontation between pakistani scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani, a proponent of so called ""Islamic banking,"" and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan's (TTP) Mufti Noor Wali.Usmani had slammed Wali and TTP for acting against the Pakistani state.Pakistan is a sanctuary for numerous Islamic militant organisations with overlapping and conflicting ideologies, allegiances and complicated inter-relations.The ISKP sprang out of dissenting Afghan Taliban, TTP and al-Qaida cadres in the Af-Pak region around 2015-15. It was also joined by some defectors from JuD, LeT and other extremist groups with presence in Pakistan. It has received support from the Islamic State’s core leadership in Iraq and Syria since its founding. It has been active in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and has claimed responsibility for several high-profile attacks.The ISKP, just like the TTP, targets the Pakistani state and its interests.

Afghanistan: Taliban plans to turn former foreign military bases into SEZs

NEW DELHI: The Taliban regime in Afghanistan is planning to convert former foreign military bases into special economic zones to promote economic activities Acting deputy prime minister for economic affairs Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar said on Sunday that the ministry of industry and commerce will take control of the military bases of foreign forces ""with the intention of converting them into special economic zones"".Under a pilot plan, foreign military bases in the capital Kabul and in northern Balkh province will be converted into economic zones, according to a report by Reuters.In December last year, the acting commerce minister had said he was was working on a plan for former American and Nato military bases.Afghanistan's economy has been struggling ever since the Taliban took over in 2021 as foreign troops withdrew after 20 years of war.Aid agencies have warned there is an impending humanitarian crisis as the takeover sparked a cut in development funding, freezing of foreign-held central bank assets and sanctions on the banking sector.The Taliban administration's decision to curtail the rights of women has further isolated the country from the international stage. Its move to bar women from working in NGOs exacerbated the problem as most aid agencies suspended operations in the crisis-hit nation.The Taliban have said they are focused on boosting economic self-sufficiency through trade and investment. Some foreign investors, however, have expressed concerns over a series of attacks, including at a hotel popular with Chinese businessmen, claimed by the Islamic State .The World Bank though has noted that exports rose and the Taliban administration managed to keep revenues largely steady in 2022.","(With inputs from agencies)Afghanistan: Taliban plans to turn former foreign military bases into SEZsNEW DELHI: The Taliban regime in Afghanistan is planning to convert former foreign military bases into special economic zones to promote economic activities Acting deputy prime minister for economic affairs Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar said on Sunday that the ministry of industry and commerce will take control of the military bases of foreign forces ""with the intention of converting them into special economic zones"".Under a pilot plan, foreign military bases in the capital Kabul and in northern Balkh province will be converted into economic zones, according to a report by Reuters.In December last year, the acting commerce minister had said he was was working on a plan for former American and Nato military bases.Afghanistan's economy has been struggling ever since the Taliban took over in 2021 as foreign troops withdrew after 20 years of war.Aid agencies have warned there is an impending humanitarian crisis as the takeover sparked a cut in development funding, freezing of foreign-held central bank assets and sanctions on the banking sector.The Taliban administration's decision to curtail the rights of women has further isolated the country from the international stage.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh at his residence. Probing allegations against Brij...,2023-02-21 19:44:21+05:30,Asian indoor medallist triple jumper Praveen Chithravel overcomes field & cold to land on podium,"From training at the warm and cosy IIS facilities in Bellary, Karnataka to competing in Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan at the Asian Indoor Championships itself was half the battle won for triple jumper Praveen Chithravel. Chithravel returned with a silver, his first major international medal, with a best effort of 16.98m less than a fortnight ago.

The 21-year-old, who has spent most of his life in Southern India, admits he has an aversion to cold weather. It was no less than a nightmare for him to land in Nur Sultan when the minimum temperature was dipping below -24* C.

“Forget training outside, it was so cold out there that you couldn’t even walk a few hundred metres out there,” says Chithravel, who is still in the middle of his off-season training. The Tamil Nadu athlete didn’t even have the luxury of time to get himself acclimatised to the massive difference in weather – landing from 30* C to -25* C.

“Forget training outside, it was so cold out there that you couldn’t even walk a few hundred metres out there,” says Chithravel, who is still in the middle of his off-season training. “Forget training outside, it was so cold out there that you couldn’t even walk a few hundred metres out there,” says Chithravel, who is still in the middle of his off-season training.

A couple of years ago, a younger Chithravel would have given up hopes of doing well at the first sight of Nur Sultan’s unforgiving weather. But, in his own words, he’s a different person now. “That’s the difference between a normal athlete and a professional athlete. Everything has changed, I have changed. I have realised how minute the difference between winning and losing is,” he says.

At Nur Sultan, Chithravel landed on the day of his competition, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. His team cracked the code with a very simple approach: stay indoors. “From the airport to the hotel, from the hotel bus to the indoor stadium. I tried my best to not expose myself to the weather outside,” says Chithravel, who was holed up in his hotel room for hours before the competition. Whenever he lands in a new city for a competition, he likes to venture out and explore the surroundings, but couldn’t take that risk in Kazakhstan.

“My foreign training stints have taught me to think and work like a professional. I have observed how disciplined and focused top athletes are. I asked myself why I have come here. The answer was, to compete. So I was clear that I wasn’t going to step out until my competition gets over,” says Chithravel.

He made up for his time indoors post his meet, evident by his snow-filled Instagram reels.

Chithravel has been training under two-time world championship medallist Cuban Yoandri Betanzos for almost a year now at JSW’s IIS facilities in Bellary.

Steady progress

Chithravel has been training under two-time world championship medallist Cuban Yoandri Betanzos for almost a year at JSW’s IIS facilities in Bellary. Betanzos’ power-first approach seems to be working well for Chithravel, who has added zing to his technique since the Cuban’s arrival.

“My training has improved immensely. He focuses both on power and technique. He corrected the way I was lifting my feet during jumps and that has helped me add more explosiveness,” says Chithravel. Despite the silver medal, Chithravel feels he is a work in progress and nowhere close to realising his true potential. “It’s been just a year with coach Betanzos and there are plenty of things to improve in my jump,” he says.

The Asian indoor silver has come as a balm for Chithravel, who missed the bronze at the 2022 Commonwealth Games by just 3cms. If he had won a medal at Birmingham, it would have been a podium sweep for India with Eldhose Paul and Aboobacker winning gold and silver respectively.

“I was obviously shattered that I missed the medal by such a small margin. It wasn’t that 3cm that bothered me but my technique and approach. If I had landed the jump the way I had trained, those three centimetres wouldn’t have mattered. That day, I realised how important every single aspect of your jump is,” he says.

Chithravel has been on the circuit for a while and his outgoing nature has made him popular among athletes. He admits that he was a little too casual during his early days as an athlete. “It is not just the training but everything. I used to sleep at around 12 earlier but now I am off to bed at 10. I have limited my social media use and never miss training,” he says.

But the biggest and toughest change, as per the youngster, has been controlling his diet. Chithravel loves his seafood with a generous amount of spice. “At IIS, we get fish but it’s bland. However, that’s the best for my body. Oh, then there’s biryani, crabs, prawns (lists out a complete menu)… But now I have to keep a check on my eating habits. I am a professional now.”","From training at the warm and cosy IIS facilities in Bellary, Karnataka to competing in Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan at the Asian Indoor Championships itself was half the battle won for triple jumper Praveen Chithravel.

Nandagopal Subramaniyam was named the Player of the Match for his eye-catching performance.

Chennai Blitz took charge with Akhin leading the middle with his spirited attacks. But middle blocker LM Manoj levelled the playing field for Ahmedabad Defenders with ferocious blocks. Danial Moatazedi's hard spikes gave Chennai no breathing room.

As the game became a battle of the middle, Akhin's role became crucial for the Blitz. Chennai's strategy to switch Jobin Varghese to the left side helped Blitz but Manoj and Nandagopal kept Ahmedabad ahead with consistent blocks. With spike errors from Angamuthu and Santhosh, Ahmedabad Defenders started leaking points.

Moyo and Renato constantly started switching directions, giving Blitz an opening. Buta perfectly-executed combo move between skipper Muthusamy Appavu and Angamuthu shut down Chennai's rebellion and the Defenders took control of the proceedings.

Muthusamy kept delivering the ball to his attackers in the middle, despite getting in awkward positions, at times. Danial's towering presence only added to Chennai's worries Akhin kept trying to create an impact from the middle for Chennai but found little support and Ahmedabad closed down the game within straight sets.

With the opportunity to climb to the top position with a 5-0 win, the Defenders went all in. Nandagopal kept getting better and Chennai found no replies to his powerful serves, and Ahmedabad completed the clean sweep win to get 3 points from the match.

Kolkata Thunderbolts will be up against Mumbai Meteors and Ahmedabad Defenders will be up against Calicut Heroes on Monday.","Chennai Blitz took charge with Akhin leading the middle with his spirited attacks.

In the meantime, the passers-by had also stopped and began informing the police control room,” said Bharat Pathak , sub-inspector, Polytechnic police outpost.“A police team immediately rushed to the spot and with the help of locals, including passers-by, pulled out bodies of the four occupants from the mangled pieces of the SUV by using gas-cutters and rushed all the four to RML institute of medical sciences.

The wrestlers had gone on a dharna at Jantar Mantar in the national capital in January this year, protesting against a plethora of issues. The biggest allegation among them was that Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh had abused his position and sexually harassed women wrestlers. There were other claims as well, like financial misappropriation on the part of the WFI and its office bearers.

A release from the MYAS on Thursday stated that the Oversight Committee had requested for a two-week extension. The committee includes Olympic medal winners like Mary Kom and Yogeshwar Dutt besides former shuttler Trupti Murgunde and wrestler-turned-politician Babita Phogat. Radhica Sreeman, who is the former Executive Director of TEAMS at Sports Authority of India, and Crd (Retd) Rajesh Rajagopalan, who is the former CEO of Target Olympic Podium Scheme, are also members of the six-person committee.

The extension means that the Oversight Committee will also be in charge of day-to-day affairs of WFI for two more weeks at least.","The wrestlers had gone on a dharna at Jantar Mantar in the national capital in January this year, protesting against a plethora of issues.

She urged the government to remove the member, whom she did not name. She did however identify the person as a ‘sportsperson member’ of the committee.

“Being a sportsperson it is extremely disheartening to see a fellow sportsperson of the Oversight Committee has behaved so recklessly. Their attitude towards women is evident from such behaviour,” she said in a statement posted on Twitter.

She added that the member has been “acting against the interest of women from Day One” and said she was sure that Sharan Singh was “finding support” from the member.

“The lack of empathy and insensitivity displayed by this sportsperson was shocking during the proceedings of the committee,” she further said.

While requesting that action be taken against the member, she went to add: “All this has placed great mistrust towards the committee proceedings. I’m feeling let down at not just weak but also strategic attempts of this committee member towards what should have been a fair and just investigation.”

The other two members are Radhica Sreeman, former executive director (teams) of the Sports Authority of India and Rajesh Rajagopalan, the former-CEO of the Target Olympic Podium Scheme.

India’s top wrestlers like Bajrang Punia, Vinesh, Sakshi Malik and Sarita Mor had gone on a dharna in January to protest against WFI and Sharan Singh, who they accused of sexually harassing women wrestlers.

This year's Asian Championships have been moved from New Delhi to Kazakhstan's capital Astana due to an ongoing inquiry into allegations of ""sexual misconduct, financial irregularities and misgovernance"" at the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), it has been announced.

The decision taken by United World Wrestling (UWW) comes a little more than one month before the Indian capital had been due to stage the Championships from March 28 to April 2.

The WFI Oversight Committee has been granted an additional two weeks to complete its investigation into the governing body's affairs.

The start of the Asian Championships in Astana has been pushed back by 10 days to April 7, and it is due to run until April 15, although this is provisional with final dates to be confirmed.

UWW claimed it had taken the decision because of ""recent developments in Indian wrestling and a pending inquiry by the Indian Sports Ministry against the Wrestling Federation of India"".

An Oversight Committee led by Olympic bronze medallist boxer and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) Athletes Commission chair Mary Kom was established by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports last month to investigate the WFI.

The Oversight Committee was also tasked with managing the WFI's affairs.

This followed allegations by three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat and Olympic bronze medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik of misconduct and sexual harassment by WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and other officials.

Wrestlers had protested in New Delhi for three days calling for the dismissal of Singh and dissolution of WFI.

Singh has denied all the allegations, but has stepped aside until the investigation concludes.

The Oversight Committee had initially been granted one month to complete its investigation, but the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has agreed to a two-week extension.

Phogat, Punia and Malik have previously claimed they were not consulted on the creation of the Oversight Committee.

Wrestlers also opted not to attend a meeting with an IOA panel established to investigate the allegations last month, arguing it did not make sense because some of its members were part of the Oversight Committee too.

“Some papers wrote Amritpal is desperate, he is isolated…see how the devout have supported me,” he told the media.

“They provoked us. We exercised patience for so many days…even today we were marching peacefully…. Now we will continue sitting here until ‘Singh’ is freed tomorrow,” he said.

This is not the first time the radical preacher and his followers have had a run-in with the police, but this is easily the most audacious.

Amritpal first caused consternation with his radical rhetoric when he flew back from Dubai to take over as the chief of Waris Punjab De, a “pressure group” formed by actor-activist Deep Sidhu, now deceased, last September. His elevation took place at Rode, the native village of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, amid pro-Khalistan slogans.

The self-styled preacher, who was clean-shaven until November 2021, has traversed quite a distance in the last few months with his amrit sanchar (baptism) mission, reminiscent of the one started by Bhindranwale in the early-1980s.

Five days ago, he was among 25 people booked for abduction, assault and snatching following a complaint by a former follower.

Varinder Singh, a Sikh preacher, had alleged that he was kidnapped and beaten up soon after he uploaded a video accusing Amritpal and his followers of spreading false propaganda. Lovepreet Singh Tufan, now in Ajnala police’s custody, was among the accused.

Earlier this week, there were murmurs that Amritpal, who married an NRI from London on February 11, was softening his stance when in a press conference on February 21, he clarified that he had not issued any threat to Union Home Minister Amit Shah. This statement came two days after some sections of the media reported that he had issued a veiled threat to Shah on the death anniversary of Deep Sidhu, while mentioning the assassination of former PM Indira Gandhi.

Amritpal, who not only dresses like Bhindranwale but also uses the same language, calls the latter his inspiration.

Before he returned from Dubai last September, most people in the state had only seen or heard Amritpal on social media — that too after the farmers’ agitation.

A resident of Jallupur Khera in Amritsar, Amritpal is the youngest of three children of Tarsem Singh and Balwinder Kaur. While Tarsem keeps shuttling between Dubai and India, Balwinder lives in the village. Although he remained active on Facebook since 2012, when he went to Dubai, often taking up issues concerning Punjab, Amritpal, who worked as a dispatcher in his family-owned transport business for 10 years, never got much traction before 2019 when he came out in support of farmers’ agitation against the now-repealed agri laws.

He was also a vocal supporter of Deep Sidhu and the role the Punjabi actor played in the farm stir.

Interestingly, during his Dubai days, Amritpal used social media to target regional and national political parties, feminists, activists, Khalsa Aid and even some pro-Khalistan groups such as Dal Khalsa.

During a Facebook Live session in 2019, responding to allegations from a person that he was being funded by Pakistan’s intelligence agency, Amritpal, had said, on a lighter note: “Now, don’t wish me Ram Ram, wish me Salam Waleikum. Now, I am being connected with the ISI.”

Last year, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) wrote to the Punjab government expressing concern over the alleged suspicious activities of Amritpal. Former chief minister and BJP leader Capt Amarinder Singh warned the Aam Aadmi Party government to wake up against the activities of “such forces which are inimical to Punjab” and the nation.

“People of Punjab want to know who are the forces behind this youth who had recently moved to Punjab from Dubai…it is the duty and responsibility of the state government to confront such forces and their activities,” said the veteran leader.

Finance Minister Harpal Cheema had subsequently assured the state Assembly that the AAP government would investigate Amritpal’s background.

Known for his offensive language, and unapologetic nature, Amritpal defended Deep Sidhu on social media, especially after the actor was arrested and most political parties, and farmer groups had shunned him.

But Deep’s brother Mandeep has said that the family never made Amritpal the head of ‘Waris Panjab De’. “None of us, including Deep, ever met him. He was in touch with Deep over phone for sometime but later he had blocked Amritpal. We do not know how he has declared himself head of Waris Punjab De. He is misusing our name to propagate anti-social activities,” Mandeep had earlier told the Indian Express.","Waris Punjab De followers enter Ajnala police station near Amritsar, Thursday.

He has been punished under Section 302 of the IPC only with the aid of Section 120-B. Section 120-B is an independent offence. The charges under this section are framed independently and, in case of conviction, the sentencing is to be read with the actual offence committed,” states the government's submission in the Punjab and Haryana high court. Another argument made out by the government is that Gurmeet wasn't proved to be the assailant in either murder.Gurmeet is currently serving 10 years each in two rape cases and life imprisonment in separate cases pertaining to the murder of former Dera manager Ranjit Singh and journalist Ram Chander Chhatarpati. He has four more criminal cases against him, including one filed by the CBI regarding the alleged castration of some disciples and three others related to sacrilege.The government’s response was submitted through Suneel Sangwan, superintendent of Rohtak’s Sunaria Jail. The petition challenging the Dera chief 's 40-day parole was filed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).The jail superintendent mentioned that the high court had already upheld a previous order to grant temporary furlough to the Dera chief. This was on April 7 last year.Standing by its approval for parole, the state government said the main purpose of such a provision was to give prisoners an opportunity to “solve their personal and family problems, and enable them to maintain their links with the society”. Parole is also considered “a rehabilitation tool”, it said.According to the government's response, the Dera chief had already availed of temporary parole or furlough on three different occasions “peacefully” and that “no untoward incident happened” during those periods. The state also said around 1,000 more convicts had been granted parole or furlough, but SGPC chose to challenge only the order pertaining to the Dera chief's release.“Even citizens of this country have a vested interest in preparing offenders for successful re-entry into society. Those who leave prison without strong networks of support, without employment prospects, without a fundamental knowledge of the communities to which they will return and without resources, stand a significantly higher chance of failure. When offenders revert to criminal activity upon release, they frequently do so because they lack hope of merging into society as accepted citizens,” the government's written submission states.","He has been punished under Section 302 of the IPC only with the aid of Section 120-B.

Covid News Live: India reports 6600 Fresh Covid cases · Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh: Why no FIR against Brij Bhushan, Supreme Court asks Delhi police...",None,Iisc: IISc study shows chemically modified nanosheets can aid drug delivery,"BENGALURU: In a recent study, researchers from the Indian Institute of Science’s ( IISc ) department of organic chemistry (OC) and materials research centre (MRC) show that surface modifications of two-dimensional molybdenum disulphide (an inorganic compound composed of molybdenum and sulphur) or 2D-MoS2 nanosheets can make them highly effective for applications like delivering drugs to diseased cells.Researchers modified the surface of 2D-MoS2 nanosheets with thiol (sulphur-containing) ligands and found that these thiols can be exchanged with naturally-occurring thiols in biological systems, which could allow drugs attached to these nanosheets to be released. These chemically-modified nanosheets were also found to be safe to use inside living cells.“Our study shows that thiol exchange on 2D-MoS2 nanosheets is effective, and the nanomaterial is stable in the presence of various biomolecules. This is an important observation as it will make this nanomaterial highly beneficial for biomedical applications like drug delivery,” said Mrinmoy De, associate professor, department of OC and senior author of the study published in ACS Nano.The team first used a fluorescent thiol called boron-dipyrromethene (BOD-SH) to modify the surface of the 2D-MoS2 nanosheets in order to create a functionalised version (BOD-MoS2). Then, they tested the possibility of thiol-to-thiol exchange on BOD-MoS2 using glutathione ( GSH ) – a naturally occurring thiol found in abundance in cancer cells.They found that GSH molecules swapped places with BOD-SH on the surface of the nanosheet – a process that they confirmed using fluorescence techniques.“When researchers attached an anti-cancer drug named doxorubicin (DOX) to the nanosheet surface, they found that thiol exchange could also happen between GSH and DOX, allowing DOX to get dropped off at the diseased site. Because the exchange happens only in the presence of high concentrations of GSH found in diseased cells, drugs like DOX can be delivered specifically to cancer cells without affecting normal cells, which can also potentially reduce any side effects,” IISc said.Nanomaterials usually need to be modified or customised depending on the application to improve their efficiency. Typically, they are chemically modified through a process called functionalisation, which involves attaching ligands (small or large molecules) to the surface of the nanomaterial.“Previous efforts have focused on using gold nanoparticles for such biomedical applications, according to the researchers, but these nanoparticles are expensive and have limited efficiency due to their non-selectivity between mono thiols and disulphides,” IISc said.Pradipta Behera, a postdoctoral research scholar at IISc and the first author of the study, said their experiments show that 2D-MoS2 nanosheets can be an effective substitute for gold nanoparticles, and they will be greatly beneficial in the field of nanomedicine.The MoS2 nanosheets were found to be stable in the presence of biofluids. They also have a higher surface area than gold nanoparticles, which means that they can be more efficient. Moving forward, IISc said, the team plans to work on improving the stability of the nanomaterial in the presence of various thiol-containing liquids and exploring alternative surface modification approaches to customise the nanosheets for other applications.“This work on 2D-MoS2 nanosheets can be developed in the future as an alternative to RNA and DNA delivery applications, which can be useful for detecting and treating infections such as Covid-19,” Behera added.","These chemically-modified nanosheets were also found to be safe to use inside living cells.“Our study shows that thiol exchange on 2D-MoS2 nanosheets is effective, and the nanomaterial is stable in the presence of various biomolecules.
This is an important observation as it will make this nanomaterial highly beneficial for biomedical applications like drug delivery,” said Mrinmoy De, associate professor, department of OC and senior author of the study published in ACS Nano.The team first used a fluorescent thiol called boron-dipyrromethene (BOD-SH) to modify the surface of the 2D-MoS2 nanosheets in order to create a functionalised version (BOD-MoS2).

How this change is affecting users

Airbnb background checks: What is it

Airbnb’s other safety features

Airbnb is a US-based service where users can look for short-term homestay rentals. The company acts as a broker between the client and the property owners and charges a commission from each booking. The short-term rental booking company is now reportedly banning people who are ‘associated’ with users who are already prohibited from the platform. According to a report by Motherboard, users who get banned for their relationship with a person that Airbnb considers a safety risk can return to the platform only if they can prove that they aren’t closely associated with the originally restricted user. Users who get prohibited from Airbnb due to their association with other banned users will also be allowed to return to the platform if their acquaintance appeals to the ban successfully.In an email sent to TechCrunch, the company informed that in certain circumstances, when a person has been removed from Airbnb for safety reasons, the platform may also restrict the accounts of the people who are expected to travel with the banned person. Airbnb has explained that this is a necessary safety precaution.Airbnb has also explained its decision to ban people who are associated with prohibited users is not specifically based on background check removals. The new ban policy will extend to any type of safety-related issue.As per the report, Airbnb has also recently informed a user that she has been restricted as she was ‘closely associated’ with a person who was banned from the platform. This user booked a rental on Airbnb from her boyfriend’s credit card who had a criminal record. The user also appealed the removal to which Airbnb informed her that it will uphold the ban to safeguard its community.In 2016, the company started doing background checks on its users. These checks have led to users getting banned from the platform for incidents like broken tail lights or unleashed dogs.Over the past few years, Airbnb has prioritised safety to keep both hosts and users safe. In 2020, after users were harmed at rentals arranged through the platform, the company announced a global ban on all parties and events at its listing. Airbnb’s party ban was made permanent in 2022.The company also introduced an “anti-party” tech to identify potential rule-breakers in 2022. Airbnb detects these users by checking their history of reviews, how long they have been on the platform, the length of the trip and the distance to the listing. While launching this new tech, Airbnb mentioned that it is designed to prevent bookings that have the potential to turn into unauthorised parties.","The short-term rental booking company is now reportedly banning people who are ‘associated’ with users who are already prohibited from the platform.

The Wrestling Federation of India finds itself in hot waters after WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh was accused of sexual misconduct and intimidation by the wrestlers.

Following the accusations, the wrestlers, including India’s top stars, took part in a protest as they demanded the removal of the president. Some notable names, including Bajrang Punia, Sarita Mor, Sangeeta Phogat, Anshu Malik, Sonam Malik, Satywart Malik and Jitender Kinha took part in the protests.

As the wrestlers wait for the decision of the oversight committee, Rio Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik threatened to quit the sport if the decision went against them.

Speaking to ANI, Sakshi said, “If the decision does not come in our favour and President remains as it is then we will have to quit wrestling. Both me and Vinesh have the same thinking.”

Sakshi, who was present at the Sports Conclave held in Kolkata, said the decision of the committee should have come earlier. Despite the delay, the Olympic medallist believes the committee will rule in favour of the wrestlers.

“The decision should have come by now but they need 10 more days time and we expecting a result in our favour because we mustered a lot of courage before starting the protest.

“We did this because we had enough of what we are going through over the years and we don’t want future wrestlers to face what we faced,” said Sakshi.

Though the Indian wrestler rued the delay in the decision, Sakshi went on to thank the work WFI was doing. “I am happy with the progress and I want the decision to come a bit faster because we want to be stress-free and focus on our game because Asian Games are coming and we will have the trials for it.

“So, the main thing is that the result should come fast and they are doing a fine job,” added Sakshi.

“We are fighting against such a strong person and we can’t go through all that again. We can’t go back and face the same thing again. The tournaments, the fights etc, but why are you speaking negative! We have never thought of losing this battle.

“We are positive that it will come in our favour. We are not doing anything wrong. We are fighting for a new fresh start,” asserted Sakshi.

Meanwhile, with Women’s Day just around the corner, the Indian wrestler shared a special message. “Women's Day is not only for women but also the men because men have a big role to play behind those women who are working. Everyone should support their daughters, sisters and wife. For them Women's Day should be every day, not just one single day and should encourage them to do what they want to do for their country,” signed off Sakshi.","Some notable names, including Bajrang Punia, Sarita Mor, Sangeeta Phogat, Anshu Malik, Sonam Malik, Satywart Malik and Jitender Kinha took part in the protests.
As the wrestlers wait for the decision of the oversight committee, Rio Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik threatened to quit the sport if the decision went against them.

(didn't provide detail on it further), see, it is not about men or women. It could be anyone. Whoever is wrong, why only the federation, it could be bureaucrats, it could be a politician, it could be anybody who is involved in that sport should be handled in a much better way. We are talking about such a large population and we are coming up as a sports country now. So, if we can handle this thing right now, it will be much better in future.Also, follow the sports code, see there is a guideline which has been given by the government to follow the sports code just follow it. There are certain rules which have been laid by the government. First of all, they should follow that, get the federation on the right track, and let there be a fair election.if somebody sits in one place for a long time... if you put water in one place, which is the purest water, it will get stale after some time. But the water will be fine if it keeps flowing. If somebody new will come then we will have new ideas, we will be passionate to work, so that should be the process.No no, I don't really think that only a sportsperson can do a good job, anybody can do a good job. But the person should be for the sports. How are all the IPS, IAS officers, they have been in all the departments because they have given a task to improve that department, and so is the politician.All the politicians get selected by the people and after that they choose who is good for the particular ministry. There might be somebody who has nothing to do with sports and becomes a sports minister. But the sports minister is for sports and there is a responsibility given to the sports minister to improve the facilities and the environment of sports in the country, that's good enough. So don't say that only a sportsperson can do wonders. I have seen the sportsperson destroying the sports federation.There are people who just use the situation between the government and federation and take advantage of the entire situation. And they are everywhere. First make the given guideline strict. Shut down the federation.

The Indian Express,,"Behind Amritpal rise, deepening political vacuum, widening governance gaps, growing discontent",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/punjab-amriptal-singh-rise-aap-bhagwant-mann-budget-session-8479400/,"brij bhushan sharan singh bjp · UP urban body polls: Campaign Watch | On BJP's campaign trail, a missing ... congress bjp manifesto.",2023-03-04 18:34:04+05:30,"Behind Amritpal rise, deepening political vacuum, widening governance gaps, growing discontent","The developments over the last few days seemed to be emblematic of what ails Punjab. A mob led by a would-be ideologue stormed a police station in the border district of Amritsar, bringing back memories of the dark days of militancy. And this happened on a day when Governor Banwari Lal Purohit and Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann locked horns over convening of the Assembly’s Budget Session. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led state government finally approached the Supreme Court, which rapped both the Governor and the CM while expressing its disappointment over their actions for precipitating the row.

For long Punjab has been trying to erase the memories of militancy while seeking to lower the heat over issues such as the division of river waters and the capital between Punjab and Haryana besides the demand for more autonomy. Now it is faced with a double whammy as Amritpal Singh, a 30-year-old born-again evangelist, is not only raking up the Khalistan issue but also harping on the state’s “inability” to root out the menace of drugs ravaging its youth and to punish the guilty in the 2015 sacrilege cases.

The audacious takeover of the Ajnala police station by a large mob led by Amritpal, who returned from Dubai six months ago, is causing much consternation in the state. It is also giving credence to voices that have been warning that the AAP government is “too inexperienced” to govern a sensitive state like Punjab. While CM Mann has held that not too much should be read into the Ajnala incident, the point remains that there seems to be discontent on the ground and that Amritpal is feeding on it.

Officials who support the let-it-take-its-course policy should know that Punjab needs an administration that is both strong and sensitive. While Amritpal’s act of taking the Guru Granth Sahib with him during the storming of the Ajnala police station has angered a sizeable section of the Sikh community, which says it was tantamount to “beadbi (disrespect)”, it has also emboldened him as he has got the support of anti-social elements who now see him as a powerful leader capable of providing them protection from the police.

The self-styled preacher, who is fluent in English, has attracted most of his following on the social media, landed in the state amidst a deepening political vacuum. The over-a-century-old Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which had always claimed to be the political voice of the Sikhs, has been in retreat in the wake of a string of sacrilege and related police firing incidents during its tenure. The radical outfits that have mostly worked within the framework of the Constitution while keeping the demand for Khalistan alive also appear to have run out of steam. The Congress appears to have been “discredited”. And while the AAP swept the February 2022 Assembly polls bagging 92 of the state’s total 117 seats, their legislators often face the charge of being “lightweight” with little sense of the state’s history or its political economy.

There has been a gripe among the members of several higher education institutions that the state’s youth do not have anyone they can idolise.

Armed with his fiery rhetoric centred on a three-pronged pitch — calling for drug eradication, return to a pure form of Sikhism, and the need for Khalistan due to “injustices”, perceived or imaginary, meted out to Sikhs — Amritpal is trying to appeal to the gullible and disgruntled youth. His focus on drugs and the largely unsubstantiated promise to cure addicts at his two drug rehabilitation centres is helping him expand the base of his followers.

At the same, Amritpal’s sudden rise has also sparked much speculation about his support system. On the street, people tell you, ‘’Agency da banda hai (He is the product of an agency).” Some say it could be a “build-up to President’s rule”. But there are others who flag social media for fuelling his rise, pointing out how he has been active on it for several years now.

Stepping back a little one would see that there were attempts to destabilise Punjab during the initial years of the previous Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government as well. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had then said that the Khalistan Liberation Force backed by a Pakistan agency had hatched a conspiracy to disturb the communal harmony in the state with eight targeted killings, mostly of the BJP/RSS leaders, between January 2016 and October 2017. Its victims included RSS leader Brig (retd) Jagdish Gagneja and BJP leader Ravinder Gosai, among others.

The Punjab CMs, present and past, have been complaining of drones from across the border supplying arms and drugs for over three years. The Centre has now decided to send an additional force of 18 CRPF-RAF companies, even as CM Mann is making a big push for its funds to modernise the Punjab police.

However, there seems to be a real fear in Punjab about inimical forces trying to vitiate its atmosphere. “Mahaul kharaab karan di koshish hai ji,’’ a trader in Amritsar says, echoing similar views of a farmer near the border. There is no magic bullet for this situation, but effective governance and focus on development by a vigilant state working in tandem with the Centre can keep such forces at bay.","It is also giving credence to voices that have been warning that the AAP government is “too inexperienced” to govern a sensitive state like Punjab.

And while there is indeed a re-ordering of the world order in semiconductors, electronics, and innovation, ""no country is going to be able to do this alone"".""A few years ago, we allowed in a sense, a concentration of these technologies and these products and the supply chains around certain economies.

So I think, the first is that there is this re-ordering of the semiconductor world order, electronics world order and innovation world order that is underway,"" he said.The minister advocated a cooperative framework among like-minded countries in shaping the future of technology.""So I think what we are proposing in India and we've been steadily arguing for this for some years now, is that among like-minded countries there ought to be more of a co-operative framework...whether through that co-operative framework or prism, you look at future tech, critical tech...regulating the internet, the rules, and go/no-go areas,"" he said.The minister asserted the post-COVID new world requires a much more institutional framework in how nations approach technologies, and the future of tech in particular.""That is what we are doing, that is what we believe in and we are looking at this re-ordered new world order in semiconductors, electronics and critical technologies, in terms of partnerships with like-minded nations,"" he said.There is no difference between democracy and digital democracy, and the fundamental values for physical world and cyberspace are the same, he said.""...the fundamental rights of our citizens are exactly what we transpose and expect to be implemented and available on the cyberspace...On the issue of internet shutdowns...and I think there is this narrative that's being put out there deliberately because the numbers seem large, but as a percentage of the total number of internet users in India and the diversity and the enormity of the content ecosystem, the percentage is among the smallest in the world,"" the minister said.The laws have lagged behind innovation and progress and growth of big platforms, he said observing that governments across the world are trying to catch up with that lag over the last ten years.""Certainly in India, we are trying to catch up very fast,"" Chandrasekhar said.The minister observed that the relationship between governments and tech, and governments and the Internet is undergoing a tectonic change.There is a ""correction"" in the way governments are responding to platforms, and what the platforms mean in terms of good as also user harm, and other issues.""For many years, innovation was left unregulated because it was innovation. So you suddenly found, after a decade of being left alone, we suddenly have to deal with the so-called problems of big tech,"" he said.India, he said, has clearly set the boundary conditions for platforms to operate.""...which is, that internet should be open. It should certainly not be like the Chinese internet. Internet should be a safe and trusted space,"" he said citing the this is important given that 800 million Indians are using the internet, and the number is set to rise to 1.2 billion Indians by 2025-26.So, the internet being a safe and trusted space is an ""article of faith"" and a duty for the government to deliver to its citizens.""And the third, is accountability principle, that regardless of whether you're a big tech headquartered in a (particular) land or nation, if you do business in India, you have to be accountable,"" Chandrasekhar said.Certain casted obligations of platforms operating in India are prescribed and enforced through the IT rules.""We have got nine categories of content and information that are absolutely no-go areas for platforms and there is a casted obligation on them, that if they want to enjoy the immunity and Safe Harbor , under our laws, from prosecution and continue to pretend that they are not publishers, they have to do these (comply with rules on) one to nine content issues...ranging from CSAM ( Child Sexual Abuse Material ) to misinformation at the other end of spectrum,"" he said.While there is that ""predictable conversation"" about whether or not it infringes on freedom of speech, or privacy, ""our contention is that we will protect the fundamental rights of Indian citizens, but at the same time, we have a duty to maintain that internet is a safe and trusted space for all Indians"", he said.","And while there is indeed a re-ordering of the world order in semiconductors, electronics, and innovation, ""no country is going to be able to do this alone"".

As a result, people living with HIV (PLHIV) in several parts of the country, including Maharashtra , are having to consume five pills per day to attain the necessary dosage, as opposed to a single pill.The drug combination Abacavir+Lamivudine (AL), which is given as an alternative first-line drug, has been in short supply since February. The shortage has affected several ART centres across Maharashtra, but it has hit the north-eastern states more acutely.After the stocks didn’t arrive in February, the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) that had paediatric formulations of AL in excess, decided to give it to the adult patients to ensure they didn’t miss out on treatment. A state official confirmed that in order to tide over the crisis they decided to start distributing the paediatric formulation as they had stocks of more than five months. In northeastern states, even pediatric formulations have been in short supply. In children, AL is given as the first line of treatment.Vijay Nayar, a member of the NGO Udaan , stated it is unfortunate that drug stockouts have become a common occurrence due tothe procurement process not being completed on time. “It is not easy to consume so many pills every day. Several patients are also on other medication for other opportunistic infections,” he said. He added the shortage of one drug or the other is invariably a problem.Recently, shortages of Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) have also been reported. Sources said the drug combination is being replaced with the new medicine dolutegravir. The National Aids Control Organisation ( NACO ) centrally procures all HIV drugs, which are then distributed to states that further send them to districts.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) set out a path in January for Russian and Belarusian athletes to earn Olympic places through Asian qualifying events and to compete as neutrals, with no flags or anthems.

Athletes from those countries were banned from many international competitions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but some international federations are now allowing them back following the IOC’s guidance.

The Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) passed its resolution following a meeting in Nouakchott, Mauritania, with the body’s president Mustapha Berraf saying it “aligns with the position of the IOC”.

“The members came out unanimously in favour of the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in all international competitions,” ANOCA said in a statement.

“It will thus be a question of allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in complete neutrality without any sign of identity in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

“… politics cannot put pressure on sport and withdraw from it all its nobility values ​​which revolve around peace, unity and solidarity… The athletes must in no case pay the heavy price of a conflict whatever it is and wherever it is.”

Ukraine and its Eastern European and Baltic neighbours are leading the call for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be banned from Paris 2024 as long as Russia’s troops maintain their invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a “special operation”. Belarus has been a key staging area for the invasion.

In February, more than 30 countries including the United States, Britain and France pledged their support for banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from international competitions.

Ukraine has also threatened to boycott the Olympics over Russia’s participation.","African Olympic committees passed a resolution on Saturday supporting the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the Paris 2024 summer Olympics as neutrals.

Gill had a red notice issued against him by the Interpol. A special CBI team had earlier gone to Suva in Fiji to bring Gill back, sources said.According to CBI, over Rs 60,000 crore was siphoned by the company which Gill was associated with as a director. The agency had started the investigation against the Pearls Group and its founder Nirmal Singh Bhangoo on February 19, 2014 on the allegations of cheating over five crore investors by offering them land in return of their investments.CBI officials said that Gill had a non-bailable warrant issued against him by a special court which was followed by a red corner notice.

These schemes were running illegally and both the companies were allegedly engaged in fraudulent activities including forgery in their day-to-day operations,"" A CBI spokesperson said.After registering a case in February 2014, the CBI had conducted searches at the office premises and residences of directors in Delhi, Jaipur ( Rajasthan ), Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana which had led to recovery of huge records and data relating to deposits from public and diversion of funds, besides other incriminating documents.Investigation also revealed that the accused fraudulently diverted the alleged funds collected under the aegis of Jaipur-based private company for purported investment in Australian companies. It was also alleged that 132.99 million AUD (approx) was found to have been diverted to Australian companies, the CBI spokesperson said.The investors had not allegedly received any land allotment letter from the company and almost all the investors to whom the company had allotted the land were unpaid, he said, adding that most of the land was either non-existent or government land or not sold by the owner.The arrest comes as part of Operation Trishul launched by the agency to bring back fugitives who have fled abroad. The operation aims to geo-locate proceeds of crimes and fugitives with the help of Interpol and bring them back.

Aman Sehrawat, who became the first Indian to win a gold medal at the U-23 World Championship last year, is one such youngster. The 18-year-old is in good form after picking up the bronze medal at the recent Zagreb Ranking Series event.

In Dahiya’s 57kg category, in which he won a Tokyo silver, Sehrawat impressed from the off. After winning a comfortable first bout, he overturned a 0-4 deficit against Atish Todkar of Maharashtra to prevail 14-4, showing good touch in an impressive showing.

The surprise of the day came in the 70kg category, where Mulayam Yadav of Uttar Pradesh, another junior World Championship medallist, defeated 2022 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Naveen Malik 7-4.

Among the promising crop of wrestlers that missed out were Sagar Jaglan and Sujeet. The latter missed out to fellow Haryana wrestler Anuj Kumar in the 65kg category, while Sagar was eliminated in the final playoff round of the 74kg category by Delhi’s Yash Tushir, who booked his flight to Astana, where the event will be held between April 7 to 15, by winning 8-3. Yash won the gold at the 2022 National Games, while Sagar is the wrestling nationals champion.

The event was initially meant to be held in New Delhi, but governing body United World Wrestling (UWW) moved it out of the country after the sports ministry appointed an Oversight Committee in charge of the day-to-day operations of the sport after allegations of sexual harassment and intimidation were levelled against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Singh.

Punia and Dahiya, who missed out due to a wrist and knee injury respectively, were members of the group of wrestlers that protested against Brij Bhushan in Delhi in January.

The Oversight Committee, chaired by former boxer Mary Kom which also has the presence of wrestlers Babita Phogat and Yogeshwar Dutt, hosted the selection trials.

One of those in protesting contingent, Deepak Punia, a former World Championship silver-medallist, comfortably sealed his place in the 92kg category of the Asian event. 2022 CWG bronze medallist Deepak Nehra also made the cut in the 97kg category,

The selection trials for women wrestlers will be held in New Delhi on Saturday.

In a number of initiatives announced on the occasion of the International Women’s Day, the world athletics governing body also committed itself to the extension of its Ukraine Solidarity Fund to enable Ukrainian athletes, majority of them female, to participate in World Athletics Championships and other events this year.

“… increase the number of women on the World Athletics Council from eight members currently to a minimum of 10 members – including at least one female Vice President – at the Council elections in August 2023. Women will represent 40% of the World Athletics’ Council,” World Athletics said in a release.

“Build a pipeline to increase to 50% the female representation across our four commissions for the 2023-2027 term, in order to provide more opportunities for female administrators with aspirations to run for our Council in 2027.” WA also aims to increase the number of female coaches at the World Championships to at least 20% by the 2025 edition in Tokyo by encouraging member federations to send more female coaches, and providing the learning pathway in countries where women are under represented at the coaching level.

“To help us achieve this, our Gender Leadership Taskforce is working with the IOC Female Coaching Leadership Programme – WISH – to enable eligible female coaches to be selected as part of their national team for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. A total of eight candidates from athletics have been selected for the programme.” Each of the new pledge was aimed at improving gender equity in athletics and closing the gender gap in the sport in the third year of the #WeGrowAthletics campaign, the world body said.

Launched on International Women’s Day 2021 with the ambition of making substantial gains in eliminating gender bias in athletics, this campaign has already made notable strides in fulfilling or initiating all of the pledges we have made in the last 24 months, it said.

World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said: “In order to achieve true equity in our sport, it is important that we offer our female athletes, administrators, and officials the tools and environment they need to be empowered to pursue careers at all levels of athletics. “Be it by setting quotas for female representation on our Council, or providing more flexible learning and development opportunities that better suit women’s commitments – we are absolutely dedicated to making our sport equitable and representative for all.” He urged all the stakeholders to take an active role in order to achieve the collective goals regarding equity for women in athletics, sport, and every aspect of life.

In addition to the new pledges, World Athletics said it was making an additional pledge to support female Ukrainian athletes a year after the outbreak of war in their country.

“Last year, through the establishment of our Ukraine Solidarity Fund, we supported over 100 Ukrainian athletes – along with their immediate family members and entourage including coaches and technical officials – to train, qualify, and participate in World Athletics Championships events. Female athletes made up 70% of athlete.

“We pledge to repeat the World Athletics Ukraine Solidarity Fund to support Ukrainian athlete attendance in Budapest and other World Athletics Championships events.”","World Athletics on Wednesday pledged to have 40 per cent female representation in its Council, the all-powerful decision making body, and a woman vice president this year in a significant step towards gender equity in the sport.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) set out a path in January for those athletes, who were banned from many international competitions after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine last year, to compete without their flags and anthems.

Many countries have publicly opposed the IOC’s proposal and Ukraine has threatened to boycott the Paris Olympics as long as Moscow’s troops remain in Ukraine, which Belarus helped facilitate.

The COC has said it supports the IOC’s recommendation that Russia and Belarus should be barred from international competitions but added it is open to exploring how athletes from the two countries could compete as neutrals in Paris.

“We condemn the recent public statements issued by the COC supporting the ‘exploration of a pathway’ for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as ‘neutrals’ in the 2024 Paris Olympics,” the athletes wrote in a letter on Wednesday.

“Opening the door to ‘neutral’ Russian and Belarusian participation… sends a message that the COC is no longer concerned with Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.

“No pathway should be considered for Russian or Belarusian athletes to compete in the Olympic Games until Russia fully withdraws from Ukraine.”

Reuters has reached out to the COC for comment.

Canada was among 35 countries that released a joint statement in February calling on the IOC to clarify the definition of “neutrality” and pledging their support for banning Russians and Belarusians from international competitions.

COC chief executive David Shoemaker told CBC Sports last month athletes from the two counties should publicly speak out against the war to attain the neutral status they would require to compete.

“Recent remarks by COC officials endorsing conditions for neutrality… are unfounded and out of touch,” the letter added. “For example, it is illegal in Russia to publicly denounce military actions abroad.

“Refusing their participation in international sport is not simply a matter of denying athletes a chance to compete because of their passport, it is a rejection of an unlawful and inhumane war and a recognition of the role international sport plays in geopolitics.”

Canadian greats and Olympic gold medallists were among the signatories, which included ice dancer Tessa Virtue, hockey player Hayley Wickenheiser, cross-country skier Beckie Scott and freestyle skier Alex Bilodeau","A group of 42 retired Canadian Olympians have urged the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) to reverse its support for Russian and Belarusian participation at next year’s Paris Games, unless Russia withdraws from Ukraine.

Countries where Twitter Blue is officially available

Elon Musk launched paid Twitter Blue subscription in December, purportedly as one of the ways to cut losses the company incurred after advertisers paused spending on the platform. It was initially launched in a handful of markets and in the last three months saw the subscription model expand to multiple regions. Recently, Twitter announced its availability to more countries in Europe. In the latest development, the lead privacy regulator in the region has raised concerns about the rollout.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon said that she was concerned that the company launched its Twitter Blue subscription service in the region without consulting her office, despite pledging to do so.She said the service raised privacy concerns around the verification of accounts to prevent users from posing as public figures.“We’re a little bit more concerned this week now that we see that the blue tick subscription service is rolling out here in EU countries having been reassured that it wasn’t going to roll out in the European Union (EU) and certainly not before there have been discussions with our office,” Dixon was quoted as saying.Dixon said no formal inquiry has been launched but “we’re at a heightened state of contact with Twitter.” She also said consultation prior to launching a product (or service) in the region is the “best practice.”She noted that Twitter now has a “very strong” data protection officer. “But beyond the data protection office, there are clearly other forces at play. And we need to understand a little bit more about those,” Dixon added.Twitter expanded Twitter Blue paid subscription to 20 more countries earlier this month. It is now available in 37 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, India, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Netherlands, Poland, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Romania, Czech Republic, Finland, Denmark, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovakia, Latvia, Slovenia, Estonia, Croatia, Luxembourg, Malta, and Cyprus.Twitter Blue is available in India at the price of Rs 900 per month on Android/iOS and Rs 650 per month on the web.","No inquiry launchedCountries where Twitter Blue is officially availableElon Musk launched paid Twitter Blue subscription in December, purportedly as one of the ways to cut losses the company incurred after advertisers paused spending on the platform.

The IOA had on January 20 formed a seven-member committee headed by the legendary boxer MC Mary Kom to investigate the allegations of sexual harassment against the WFI president by some of the country's top wrestlers.

""It (report) is not finalised, it is going on. We have met the players (wrestlers). The (IOA) committee will finalise and give the report to the IOA later,"" Usha told PTI after presiding over the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the IOA here on Saturday.

""It is a sensitive issue and it has to be done in a good way. Very soon we will do that,"" she said when asked if there is any deadline for submitting the report.

""It happened when (just after) we took charge. It was with ministry earlier. Both the ministry and IOA have constituted committees."" The IOA panel was formed after the agitating wrestlers, including the likes of Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat, Deepak Punia and Ravi Dahiya, had demanded the formation of an enquiry committee to probe the allegations against Singh.

The government had formed an oversight committee also under Mary Kom to probe the charges levelled by the wrestlers. Singh had appeared before the oversight committee of the government on February 28 and had outrightly rejected all the charges.

The IOA AGM, the first after Usha took charge in December last year, also decided to stage the 37th National Games in Goa towards the end of October or early part of November.

The IOA wants Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate the Games and the dates of the multi-sport event could be fixed depending on his availability.

""We are going to organise the National Games in Goa and 90 per cent of work is already completed there,"" said Usha, the sprint queen of the 1980s.

""The dates are not yet fixed. It can be from October end to November 12 like that,"" she added.

""We want the Prime Minister to inaugurate the National Games. According to the time of his availability, we are going to fix the dates (of the Games)."" The Goa government has expressed its readiness to host the Games after multiple delays due to infrastructure related issues.

Some officials of the IOA want the National Games to end before Diwali which falls on November 12.

Earlier last month, officials of the state government, including the sports minister, had met Usha and the IOA top brass on the matter.

Recently, the Games Technical Conduct Committee (GTCC) of the IOA, under the chairmanship of its executive council member Amitabh Sharma, made an inspection and declared that Goa is ready for the National Games.

Thirty-seven sports disciplines have been approved and a few more traditional games may also be included later on.

Goa was to host the 36th edition of the National Games in 2016 but it did not happen due to multiple delays, mainly relating to construction of infrastructure. Gujarat then hosted the event in September-October last year.

On the issue of the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer of the IOA, Usha said, ""We have called for applications. We had norms (criteria), but only one application is upto the mark. We need more (applications). So, we are going to advertise (for the post) again."" IOA Joint secretary and All India Football Federation President Kalyan Chaubey has been discharging the functions of the CEO so far.

Under the new Constitution drafted by a Supreme Court-constituted panel and approved by the International Olympic Committee, the IOA was to appoint a CEO who would perform the functions of the erstwhile Secretary General.

The CEO will be an ex-officio member of the Executive Council without voting rights.

The IOA had earlier called for applications for the post to be submitted on January 31 at the latest.

One of the eligibility criteria for the said post is that the candidate should be a ""management professional with an experience of no less than 10 years as the CEO of a company/entity with an annual turnover of no less than Rs 25 crores"".

Article 15.3 of the amended IOA constitution also says that ""the CEO shall be proposed by a nomination committee comprising the (IOA) president, chairman of the Athletes Commission and one IOC member from India"".

Contentious refereeing, headstrong strong men wrestlers and coaches, and a unilateral decision making federation boss always made for a combustible combination.

Something similar was still expected after the functioning of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) was suspended last month following unprecedented allegations of wrongdoing (financial and otherwise) made by top wrestlers against officials and three-term president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, and replaced instead with an oversight committee appointed by the Ministry of Sports.

The selection trials for the Asian Championships were the first major competition conducted by the six-member committee headed by Olympic bronze medalist boxer MC Mary Kom. Trouble began two days before the start of the trials, when on the 6 th of March, five wrestlers approached the courts seeking their inclusion in the tryouts. While the protesting wrestlers were duly inducted, there was still plenty of tension in the air heading into it.

Police were deployed and spectators were kept to a minimum – athletes were only permitted to bring in two support staff. Even the media was discouraged on the first day to keep the number of non-athletes and potential troublemakers down to a minimum. There was plenty of potential for that. Even the very specific Venn diagram of selection trials held at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi Stadium would throw up a police complaint (after supporters of one wrestler thrashed his opponent after an ill tempered contest in 2018).

Nevertheless for all their efforts the inevitable happened. After a contentious final second four-point throw awarded to Sagar won him a match against Sachin Sehrawat in the men’s 67kg greco roman category, angry coaches of the latter stormed the mat. Accusations were made suggesting certain judges might have had a bias. Matters were not helped even after a review due to inconclusive footage. In the past, WFI president Brij Bhushan, who had a reputation for wielding the microphone and raining down instructions would have tried to make a unilateral decision and likely inflamed matters worse.

Something similar happened at the Commonwealth Games selection trials last year, also at the IG stadium when a problematic decision in the men’s heavyweight category ended up with a referee slapped and a wrestler suspended.

This time though, the oversight committee represented on the day by Captain (Retd) Rajagopalan, former SAI executive director and former Olympic bronze medallist wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, cooled matters down by simply going by the book and referring the matter to a United World Wrestling (UWW) panel for precisely such situations.

The result came in half an hour later in favour of Sagar and with the final decision being made by an international (neutral) body, the protest too died away.

Later on, Captain Rajagopalan would suggest exactly how the situation had been handled. “We studied the UWW rules of how the tournaments are organised. Once we knew there was a precedent to handle such a situation, we went by that,” he suggested.

Indeed but for the legal challenge prior to the tournament with players, the selection trials largely passed off without incident. Unlike in the past, bouts were not stopped midway for officials to pose for pictures with players, there were no long stoppages of play due to coaches or wrestlers’ protests and there were no threats of violence from officials or competitors. A few of the senior athletes – Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik -- who had led the protests at Jantar Mantar which led to the initial suspension in the functioning of the Federation didn’t compete at the selection trials but the others barring injury did compete in New Delhi.

What the trials suggested is that it is indeed possible to conduct a largely controversy free wrestling event. It remains to be seen though what the future would bring. The oversight committee is expected to present their fact finding report on the issues raised by the protesting wrestlers some time next week. However it is uncertain when the sports ministry would act on the findings and what the role of the oversight committee would be in the functioning of the federation until then.

Despite a successful trial, not all members of the committee are looking forward to the continued responsibility. The Oversight Committee was expected to deliver its fact-finding report on the 23rd of February and that date was subsequently pushed back by another couple of weeks which have now passed. “We will have to continue being responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the Wrestling Federation of India until we are told to stop by the Ministry of Sport. It’s not something that is ideal because all of us have our regular jobs. Work is piling up there as well. But this is a responsibility we have been given,” said a member of the committee.","The selection trials for the Asian Championships were the first major competition conducted by the six-member committee headed by Olympic bronze medalist boxer MC Mary Kom.

Fosbury won gold in the high jump at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, where he jumped back first to clear the bar, a technique that has since been named the 'Fosbury Flop' and used by all high jumpers today.

""It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that longtime friend and client Dick Fosbury passed away peacefully in his sleep early Sunday morning after a brief recurrence of lymphoma,"" Schulte wrote on Instagram.

""The track and field legend is survived by his wife Robin Tomasi, son Erich Fosbury and stepdaughters Stephanie Thomas-Phipps... and Kristin Thompson.""

The straddle or scissor jump were common techniques in the high jump. But when foam matting was introduced to break the athletes' fall, Fosbury used his new technique for the first time on the world stage.

The American set a then-Olympic record of 2.24 metres to take the gold and change the sport forever, with more and more athletes attempting the back-first jump as the technique gradually gained acceptance.

""Dick Fosbury was always true to the Olympic values and served the Olympic Movement in a number of functions, including as President of World Olympians. He will forever be remembered as an outstanding Olympic Champion,"" International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said.

""With his groundbreaking ""Fosbury Flop"" technique, Dick Fosbury not only won Olympic gold at Mexico City 1968 but also revolutionized the high jump. He was truly an Olympic pioneer and legend,"" Team USA posted on Twitter.

""I am deeply saddened by the passing of Dick Fosbury, a true legend and pioneer in the world of track and field. Dick's innovative technique of the 'Fosbury Flop' revolutionised the high jump event and forever changed the sport,"" said Max Siegel, CEO of USA Track & Field.

""I had the privilege of seeing first-hand how Dick tirelessly advocated for the well-being of athletes, particularly retired athletes,"" said Michael Conley, USATF Board Chair and High Performance Division Chair.

World Athletics said in a statement: ""Fosbury’s innovation took the high jump to another level and he remained involved in athletics throughout his life, sharing his knowledge and skill with future generations... He leaves a remarkable legacy.""

""Dick Fosbury had revolutionised the practice of this sport with his sublime audacity. Thoughts to his loved ones,"" said Amelie Oudea-Castera, France's Minister of Sports and the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Fosbury's gold and his contribution to the sport also earned him a spot in the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.","Olympic high jump champion Dick Fosbury, who revolutionised the event with a radically different jumping technique that was eventually named after him, died on Sunday aged 76, his agent Ray Schulte said on Monday.

A single-judge bench of Justice Prathiba Singh was hearing a plea by three boxers Manju Rani, Shiksha Narwal and Poonam Poonia who after not making it to the national team for the championship moved the High Court seeking its intervention for their inclusion.

The counsel for the three boxers said that between 2018-2022, their performance was better than some of those selected for the tournament who hardly won any medals. Justice Singh observed that while the court cannot get into the merit of selection, the difference in the performance of some of the players was “quite stark”. The HC further asked BFI’s counsel to seek instructions on the issue.

The boxer’s counsel argued that player selection should happen on the basis of meritorious past performances and the three boxers should be selected. BFI’s counsel said that the names of selected players have already been sent to the concerned authorities. The matter is next listed on March 14.

On March 7, the HC had asked BFI to submit the evaluation forms of the three boxers, which was submitted before the HC. BFI had previously argued that players had been evaluated and their candidature had been rejected. It was argued earlier that players are evaluated at the national camp on the basis of selection criteria for national camps and world championships. While the HC had previously refused to grant interim relief to the boxers it had said that if in the meantime if a reserved category player is being maintained by the respondent then the petitioner boxers can be considered for the same.

It was previously argued by the boxers that the players who made it to the national team were those who had been defeated by the petitioner boxers at the National Championship in Bhopal last December. The plea states that the petitioners had requested the relevant authorities to consider their names for selection in the women’s world championship, “but they did not get any fruitful results”.","The Delhi High Court on Monday sought Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) response on the past performance of certain boxers selected for the Women’s World Boxing Championships to take place in the national capital between March 15-31.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, for example, recently provided Tucker Carlson with an archive of security camera footage from January 6, which the Fox News host has used to downplay the day's events and promote conspiracy theories.“Make no mistake about it, what happened that day was a disgrace,"" Pence said in his Gridiron Dinner remarks. ""And it mocks decency to portray it any other way.”Trump, meanwhile, has continued to spread lies about his election loss. He's even spoken in support of the rioters and said he would consider pardoning them if he was reelected.Speeches at the Gridiron Dinner are usually humorous affairs, where politicians poke fun at each other, and Pence did plenty of that as well.He joked that Trump's ego was so fragile, he wanted his vice president to sing “Wind Beneath My Wings” — one of the lines is “did you ever know that you're my hero?” — during their weekly lunches.He took another shot at Trump over classified documents.“I read that some of those classified documents they found at Mar-a-Lago were actually stuck in the president' s Bible ,"" Pence said. “Which proves he had absolutely no idea they were there.”Even before the dinner was over, Pence was facing criticism for his jokes about Transportation Secretary Buttigieg, the first openly gay Cabinet member in U.S. history.Pence mentioned that, despite travel problems that were plaguing Americans, Buttigieg took ""maternity leave” after he and his husband adopted newborn twins.“Pete is the only person in human history to have a child and everyone else gets post-partum depression,” Pence said.","""I had no right to overturn the election.

Barring the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Opposition protested with its members coming to the well of the House shouting slogans against the government. This included members of the Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Left and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS).

Even before the Opposition started its protests over the multiple arrests and questioning of its leaders by central investigative agencies, BJP MPs raised the slogan ‘Rahul Gandhi desh ko badnam karna bandh karo (Rahul Gandhi, stop defaming the nation)’. Singh got up and said Gandhi had raised questions on Indian democracy on foreign soil.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said, “India is the mother of democracy… Rahul Gandhi, who is a member of this House, cast aspersions on the Chair saying his mic was turned off. He was allowed to make his entire speech, but still he blamed the Chair. When the fundamental rights of citizens were suspended during the Emergency where was democracy? When an ordinance promulgated by a government in which Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister and leaders like Sharad Pawar were ministers was torn publicly, calling it ‘nonsense’, making the PM helpless, where was democracy?” he asked.

Speaker Om Birla appealed to both sides to remain seated so that the Question Hour could be taken up. With both sides refusing to relent, Birla adjourned the proceedings till 2 pm.

Before the House met, Union ministers Piyush Goyal and Anurag Thakur, along with Joshi, issued a statement seeking an apology from Rahul Gandhi for his remarks in London.","The second leg of the Parliament’s Budget session kicked off on Monday but soon after, Speaker Om Birla later adjourned the House till 2 pm.

He said this delegation will also meet the Election Commission to demand the conduct of early Assembly elections in J&K.

After a three-hour-long meeting with a slew of Opposition parties at his residence in Jammu, Abdullah said their meeting discussed the prevailing situation in the UT and the ways and means to pull it out of its current morass, deciding to meet the national leaders in Delhi to seek their support in getting back J&K’s statehood. “We want a powerful statehood like other states in the country and not truncated statehood,’’ he said, adding that they will also apprise the national leaders of J&K’s situation so that it could be raised forcefully in Parliament during the coming session.

“We will also be meeting the Election Commission for early holding of Assembly elections,’’ Abdullah said, pointing out that the Assembly polls have not been held in J&K since 2014 despite the fact that there has been a Supreme Court ruling that the polls must be held within six months of dismissal of an elected government.

Referring to the statements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the situation in J&K was “normal” and that a meeting of the G-20 nations will also be held in the Valley in May, Abdullah asked why elections could not held then given such a situation.

Asked whether the J&K Opposition delegation will also meet PM Modi and Shah during their Delhi visit, he said they will decide it only after meeting other national leaders. “Thereafter, we will meet again in Jammu and also in Kashmir before deciding our future course of action,’’ he said.

Charging that a “blacklisted’’ company has been awarded the contract for conducting the Computer Based Test (CBT) for selection of candidates for various government vacancies advertised by the J&K State Services Selection Board (JKSSSB), the National Conference chief also accused the UT government of allegedly committing atrocities on local youth who have been protesting against it. “On one hand, they talk of rooting out corruption, but the situation is before all of you. They (JKSSSB) are giving contract to a blacklisted company,’’ he said, asking the administration, “Why you are not disbanding it… Why it is necessary to go with that company?”

Abdullah also slammed the recent demolition drive by the administration across the UT, especially when it could not provide employment, he charged, to the people. “You promised 50,000 jobs many years ago,’’ he asked the administration, asking “how many have been appointed so far’’.

The Indian Express,,"As CM Sukhu goes about cancelling Jai Ram regime institutions, Congress-BJP row hits a flashpoint",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/sukhvinder-singh-sukhu-jairam-thakur-congress-bjp-8499053/,"brij bhushan sharan singh bjp · UP urban body polls: On BJP's campaign trail, a missing Brij Bhushan · MK Stalin Cabinet shuffle.",2023-03-15 16:02:16+05:30,"As CM Sukhu goes about cancelling Jai Ram regime institutions, Congress-BJP row hits a flashpoint","The face-off between the Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu-led Congress government and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the shutdown of institutions continues to rage, even as the latter is looking to turn up the heat on the government on the issue.

Last week, the Congress government ordered the closure of 19 degree colleges, adding them to the list of an estimated over 900 government institutions and offices opened during the previous Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP regime that the Sukhu dispensation has denotified since taking the reins of the hill state three months ago.

Over the last few weeks the BJP has stepped up its protests against the Sukhu government against its continuing bid to close such institutions, calling it “arbitrary” and “anti-development”. On its part, the government has justified its move as “necessary in public interest”.

On Monday, a BJP delegation led by Leader of Opposition in the Himachal Assembly Jai Ram Thakur and state BJP chief Suresh Kashyap, submitted a memorandum to the newly-appointed Governor Shiv Pratap Shukla against the closure of these institutions.

According to the memorandum, over 900 government institutions opened during the Jai Ram regime have been closed by the Congress government so far.

Significantly, one of the first decisions that Sukhu took after taking charge as the CM on December 11 last year, was to shut down institutions and offices notified or upgraded after April 1, 2022. These entities belonged to various government departments and organisations including the PWD, power, finance, police booths, schools and healthcare units, among others.

The Sukhu government argued that these government entities had been notified by the BJP government arbitrarily as part of “vote bank politics” just ahead of the November 2022 Assembly polls without providing financial resources for their establishment and operation. It charged that these institutions existed just on paper and that no recruitments were made for them.

This immediately erupted in a row between the two sides, with the BJP targeting Sukhu for allegedly playing “vendetta politics at the cost of public interest”.

Citing the instance of the government’s latest move to close 19 degree colleges, the Sukhu camp said that each of them had less than 60 students. The government also said the teachers and students in these colleges will be transferred to nearby institutions.

“It is embarrassing that BJP was only concerned with playing politics. It came to our notice that one of the degree colleges had only 4 enrolments. It was then decided that they need to be shut down because they did not serve any purpose except political purpose,” said Naresh Chauhan, principal media advisor to the CM. “We have even allowed institutions, that have at least 60 students, to operate. The interests of students are primary for us and we will ensure that the opportunities for them are maximised.”

In the Budget Session of the state Assembly that got underway Tuesday, the Treasury and Opposition benches are set to take on each other fiercely on the row.

Hitting out at the Sukhu government, Jai Ram charged: “Several institutions that had been running for a long time have been shut down. This shows that the government is only concerned with settling political scores. They are not understanding that there is a sense of anger and discontent among the public. If there is no option, people will come to the streets to protest. We will raise their voice and several other issues in the session as well.”

In state political circles the closure of the institutions has been attributed to CM Sukhu’s bid to take strong decisions on various issues. The BJP has however called Sukhu a “weak CM” being allegedly controlled by the Congress high command.","According to the memorandum, over 900 government institutions opened during the Jai Ram regime have been closed by the Congress government so far.

Advertisement. The chief...,2023-03-17 16:37:37+05:30,Akalis smell vendetta as bail rejected for Sukhbir Badal in 2015 Kotkapura firing case,"The court of the additional sessions judge, Faridkot, on March 16, declined the anticipatory bail plea submitted by former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, but granted it to former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. The court directed Sukhbir to surrender before the illaqa (duty) magistrate within 15 days from the date of granting bail.

The Badals had filed anticipatory bail applications in the case of the Kotkapura firing incident of October 14, 2015, which followed the incident of sacrilege on October 12, 2015, in which torn pages of the sacred Guru Granth Sahib from Gurdwara Burj Jawahar Singh Wala were found on the streets of Bargari village. This followed successive incidents in which a Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from the gurdwara on June 1, followed by another incident some months later, in which posters with derogatory remarks about the sacred book were found pasted on the walls of Bargari village on the intervening night of September 24 and September 25.

The third incident, on October 12, led to massive protests, followed by heavy-handed police action that has remained a political issue in the state ever since. Police firing on that day in Kotkapura alone had left around 60 people injured, including over 30 cops.

The chargesheet was filed by an SIT led by Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) L K Yadav on February 24 and March 6, mentioning all eight accused in the FIR, including the Badals. All of them have been issued notices to appear before the court of Judicial Magistrate (First Class) Ajaypal Singh on March 23.

The chief spokesperson of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Daljeet Singh Cheema, said the party is exploring other legal options, now that the bail application has been rejected. “We will approach the High Court. Both the SAD leadership and our supporters firmly believe that inclusion of the names of the former CM and his deputy in this FIR is nothing but political vendetta by the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). But we have full faith in the judiciary, and are sure this chargesheet too will face the same fate as that of the one earlier filed by former ADGP Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh, which was quashed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on April 9, 2021.”

The counsel of the Badals, Shiv Kartar Singh Sekhon, said, “Statements of witnesses are the same as the ones in the reports of previous inquiries carried out by the Justice Zora Singh Commission, the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission and the investigation by then ADGP Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh. The facts remain the same. But they (the SIT under ADGP L K Yadav) have filed a new report in their own way. There is no new evidence against them (the Badals).” He added, “We are looking for further legal processes in Sukhbir’s case, and will pursue it accordingly.”

“The previous Congress government had spent its five years in power harping on this sacrilege case, rather than talking about development or other public issues. Now the AAP government is doing the same thing. Justice needs to be ensured in the incident, but indicting people for vendetta is unjustified,” said Cheema.

Even as the 2015 sacrilege and firing incidents continue to affect the political climate of the state, since December 16, 2021, an indefinite dharna has been going on at the site of the 2015 firing in Behbal Kalan. From this site, Vidhan Sabha Speaker Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Cabinet Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal had separately announced around two months ago that the names of the Badals would be added to the 2015 firing cases.

Speaking about it, Cheema said, “When politicians make such claims even before the chargesheets are filed, it shows that this is nothing but political vendetta. Let them do whatever they like. They will also face the same fate as the Congress in Punjab.” Sandhwan and Dhaliwal had visited the dharna on different occasions to encourage the protesters to vacate the site.

The dharna was launched under the banner of Bargari Insaaf Morcha by Sukhraj Singh Niamiwala, son of Krishan Bhagwan Singh, one of the two victims of the police firing at Behbal Kalan village that had followed hours after the firing at Kotkapura on October 14, 2015, to disperse another group of people blocking a road to protest the incidents of sacrilege.

A chargesheet in the Behbal Kalan case will be filed soon, Dhaliwal had announced on March 4, while addressing protestors at the dharna site, who hailed the decision to have the names of the Badals added to the chargesheet. They even organised a thanksgiving Akhand Path Bhog in appreciation the same day, and promised to vacate the site once the Behbal Kalan chargesheet is filed.

Several SAD leaders told The Indian Express, “These events are being used to target and harm a political party and its heads… The public understands the motive of the ruling party. Hence we are not panicking.” A leader added, “What else can be done now? They have named the Badals. Now we will fight it out. This is on the same lines as the various other SITs or inquiry commissions.”

The SAD is planning district-level protest dharnas from March 17 against the ruling AAP government over law and order and other governance issues.

The party was decimated in the 2022 Assembly polls, leaving it with only three seats. In the Sangrur Lok Sabha bypoll that followed, SAD came a distant fifth, with even the BJP performing better than them. The current series of events are happening with the Jalandhar Lok Sabha bypoll due soon.

On the sacrilege incidents still haunting the party after seven years, Cheema said, “Rival parties are playing politics over the issue rather than talking about facts and justice. First, the Congress diverted Punjab from the real issues facing the state. Now, the AAP is doing the same thing.”

The Kotkapura chargesheet indicts SAD chief and then Punjab Dy CM Sukhbir Badal and then Punjab Police chief Sumedh Singh Saini as “masterminds of a conspiracy (hatched) for illegal and excess use of force to conceal inaction of state on a series of three sacrilege incidents”. Sukhbir has claimed that he wasn’t present in the state on the day of the incident, and had not contacted any police official.

The 7,000-page chargesheet, filed in 17 parts, also blames then CM Parkash Badal “as a facilitator” in executing the conspiracy. It names several police officers, including then IG Param Raj Umranangal, then DIG Amar Singh Chahal, then Faridkot SSP Sukhmander Singh Mann, and then SSP Moga Charanjit Singh Sharma for “executing the conspiracy”. It also indicts then Kotkapura SHO Gurdeep Singh of distortion and concealment of facts.","The court directed Sukhbir to surrender before the illaqa (duty) magistrate within 15 days from the date of granting bail.

CHANDIGARH: Heated arguments between opposition and incumbent party MLAs, which led to a walkout by the opposition, marked Friday’s proceedings of Haryana’s budget session.The state’s budget session resumed after 21 days on Friday.The first walkout was by Congress MLAs led by leader of opposition (LoP) Bhupinder Hooda after minister of state (MoS) Sandeep Singh, who is accused of sexual harassment by a woman coach, entered the House. Congress MLAs, while objecting to his presence, sought his ouster from the assembly. Hooda and other MLAs had an argument with BJP MLAs which intensified when CM Manohar Lal Khattar and speaker Gian Chand Gupta tried to defend Sandeep.All this began with deputy leader of opposition Aftab Ahmed asking the speaker if he had allowed Sandeep to enter the House or had given him the clean chit. As arguments proceeded and speaker Gupta tried to divert the issue, Hooda himself sought a statement from Sandeep on whether he had surrendered the department by choice or was stripped off it. After this, Gupta claimed that the cabinet portfolio allocation was the prerogative of CM only.Geeta Bhukkal, the Congress’s Jhajjar MLA,then accused Gupta of shielding Sandeep. This led to arguments between Gupta and Congress MLAs.Gupta even said that allegations were often levelled against people, but could not be proved in many cases. “In case members have any issue related to any member, they may give it in writing,” he said. Khattar, who too was present in the house, asked Gupta to expunge the discussions on this issue from proceedings of the day. Congress MLAs took exception to this and staged a walkout.Sandeep had skipped all sittings ahead of presentation of budget while attributing poor health.The second walkout was after arguments erupted between Abhay Singh Chautala and Gupta on the issue of former’s question on the issue of farmers debt. In fact, Chautala claimed to have asked the details about debt taken by farmers from all banks. Cooperative minister Banwari Lal, however, provided details of loans taken from just cooperative or Haryana government banks. As Abhay got aggressive, the speaker tried to correct him and defended Yadav. This too led to arguments. Hooda joined the debate too. Later, Khattar defended Lal by saying that since the question was addressed to him, hence he could only reply about cooperative banks.Even as the issue was yet to die down, Abhay posed three more queries. With Khattar saying that the query needed time for departments to reply and speaker saying that the departments concerned and ministers will given written reply to him in 15 days, Abhay got upset and he walked out.","As arguments proceeded and speaker Gupta tried to divert the issue, Hooda himself sought a statement from Sandeep on whether he had surrendered the department by choice or was stripped off it.

Amritpal Singh, however, has managed to evade an arrest do far. He gave the police a slip and was last seen speeding away on a motorcycle on Saturday evening in Jalandhar.

Punjab crackdown

The Punjab government had launched a major operation against the separatist preacher and have arrested a large number of his supporters so far.

Amritpal Singh’s uncle Harjit Singh and two other aides were flown to Assam on Tuesday. On Sunday, his other four arrested associates were also taken to Dibrugarh Central Jail. The seven men have been charged under the National Security Act (NSA), which allows the police to detain suspects in any prison across the country.

The operation was reportedly a coordinated effort between Punjab government, the Centre, and Assam government. According to various reports, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann had discussed the plan to arrest Amritpal Singh with Home Minister Amit Shah in a meeting on March 2.

Home Ministry sources told NDTV that Amritpal Singh was planning to launch a state-wide procession to baptize the youth to carry out suicide attacks and was using de-addiction centres to stockpile weapons illegally sourced from Pakistan.

The centre seems to be moving in to take over the case as a terror investigation with a fresh FIR citing the Arms Act against Amritpal Singh.

Mann’s warning

Meanwhile, Bhagwant Mann said that strict action will be taken against those who have been trying to disturb peace and harmony in the state.

“Punjab’s peace and harmony, and country’s progress is our priority. We will not spare any force working against the country. People of this state want peace and progress,” Mann said, adding, “no incident of violence has been reported after the crackdown against the Khalistani leader.”

The suspension of mobile internet and SMS services will continue in parts of Punjab — Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Moga, Sangrur and Amritsar’s Ajnala — till Thursday noon. Haryana also is on high alert.

Six policemen were injured in the clash.","The Punjab and Haryana High Court termed the escape of radical Sikh preacher Amritpal Singh as intelligence failure of the state’s police“You have 80,000 cops, how did Amritpal Singh escape?” the Punjab and Haryana High Court asked the Punjab government on Tuesday and termed it as intelligence failure of the state’s police.

Amritpal Singh, however, has managed to evade an arrest do far. He gave the police a slip and was last seen speeding away on a motorcycle on Saturday evening in Jalandhar.

Punjab crackdown

The Punjab government had launched a major operation against the separatist preacher and have arrested a large number of his supporters so far.

Amritpal Singh’s uncle Harjit Singh and two other aides were flown to Assam on Tuesday. On Sunday, his other four arrested associates were also taken to Dibrugarh Central Jail. The seven men have been charged under the National Security Act (NSA), which allows the police to detain suspects in any prison across the country.

The operation was reportedly a coordinated effort between Punjab government, the Centre, and Assam government. According to various reports, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann had discussed the plan to arrest Amritpal Singh with Home Minister Amit Shah in a meeting on March 2.

Home Ministry sources told NDTV that Amritpal Singh was planning to launch a state-wide procession to baptize the youth to carry out suicide attacks and was using de-addiction centres to stockpile weapons illegally sourced from Pakistan.

The centre seems to be moving in to take over the case as a terror investigation with a fresh FIR citing the Arms Act against Amritpal Singh.

Mann’s warning

Meanwhile, Bhagwant Mann said that strict action will be taken against those who have been trying to disturb peace and harmony in the state.

“Punjab’s peace and harmony, and country’s progress is our priority. We will not spare any force working against the country. People of this state want peace and progress,” Mann said, adding, “no incident of violence has been reported after the crackdown against the Khalistani leader.”

The suspension of mobile internet and SMS services will continue in parts of Punjab — Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Moga, Sangrur and Amritsar’s Ajnala — till Thursday noon. Haryana also is on high alert.

BHOPAL: It was a double delight for Indian pistol shooter Manu Bhaker on Saturday. She won India's sixth medal in the ISSF World Cup Bhopal stage and ended her senior international medal drought of two years. She won the last internal medal in Delhi 2021.China continued their domination with yet another gold medal, while Cairo gold medallist Aishwary Pratap Tomar had to settle on fourth position.China has won 6 gold medals so far (2 silver and 2 bronze).

""I was trying to be consistent in scoring the points,"" said Manu. The intense battle began after both Manu and Ziyue tied on 14-hits each. Manu (20-hits) tried to fight well and scored well but that was not enough as Ziyue (22-hits) found better than her. The Indian had to settle with a bronze. ""It was a good contest.

India now has one gold, silver and two bronze medals in the competition.

China won both the gold medals on competition day two of the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) World Cup Rifle/Pistol Bhopal, even as India picked up a silver and bronze each at the M.P. Shooting Academy Range here in the outskirts of the city.

Reigning men’s 10m Air Rifle world champion Rudrankksh Patil and R. Narmada Nithin won bronze in the 10m Air Rifle Mixed Team competition while in the day’s second event, Varun Tomar and Rhythm Sangwan won silver to bolster India’s medal haul to one gold, one silver and two bronze medals. China on the other hand lead the standings with three gold and two bronze medals, with Azerbaijan, Germany and Hungary winning a silver medal each thus far.

Rudrankksh and Narmada win bronze in 10m Air Rifle Mixed Team event

In the day’s first medal event, the 10m Air Rifle Mixed Team, the Indian duo of Rudrankksh and Narmada shot a combined 632 in qualification to finish third and thereby qualify for the bronze medal match against China’s Zhang Qiongyue and Yu Haonan, who finished fourth in the 19-strong field with the same combined score.

In the bronze medal match however, both Rudrankksh and Narmada were in their elements, presenting a solid grouping to beat the Chinese pair 16-8 in what was a much closer match than the score line suggests.

Both the pairs did not shoot a single shot below the 10-mark in what was Shooting of the highest order. The high-point came in the sixth series when both Rudrankksh and Narmada shot perfect 10.9s.

Speaking after the match Narmada said, “There was pressure obviously, but then we had a really good match – the competition was so good and we quite enjoyed it.” Rudrankksh said there was no lack of motivation even if they did not win gold. “We were just asked to focus on our process and if we would have got Gold we would have been motivated but the bronze motivates us even more to do better next time,” he said.

Both India and China had entered two teams in the Mixed Team Air Rifle. While the second Chinese team of Huang Yuting and Sheng Lihao won gold defeating Hungarians Istvan Peni and Denes Eszter 16-2 in a one-sided final, the second Indian duo of Hriday Hazarika and Tilottoma Sen shot 628.1 in qualification to finish ninth.

Varun wins his second medal in Bhopal

In the second and final medal event of the day, India’s Varun Tomar and Rhythm Sangwan went down 11-17 to China’s Qian Wei and Liu Jinyao, in the 10m Air Pistol Mixed Team gold medal encounter. It was Varun Tomar’s second medal of the tournament after his bronze winning effort in the individual Air Pistol on day one.

In the initial stages of the final, it looked as if the Chinese pair would run away with it, but the Indians made a strong comeback, going from 15-7 to 15-11 before the Chinese clinched the 15th series to seal gold. Earlier in qualification, Qian and Liu had topped the nine-team field with a score of 586, while Varun and Rhythm came second with 581.

Rhythm shared her thoughts after the match saying, “We all try our best and keep our best foot forward and silver is a medal as well. Of-course Gold would have been great but we are both happy that we got a silver medal and we will try better next time.” Varun too was philosophical on missing out on Gold saying, “We try our best and try to make ourselves better and we believe whatever happens it is for the best.”

Divya TS and Sarabjot Singh, the second Indian team in fray, missed the bronze medal match by a point, finishing fifth with a score of 574.

On a day when China continued their domination, with Zhang Qiongyue winning gold in the event, Samra, the reigning national champion, scored a total of 403.9 points in the ranking round to finish third, even as Zhang (414.7 points) and Czech Republic’s Aneta Brabcova (411.3) entered the title round.

In the gold-medal round, Zhand defeated her Czech rival 16-8.

India are currently second on the medals table behind China with one gold, one silver and five bronze medals.

Samra added to the bronze medal she had won last year at the World Cup in Changwon, China.

All eyes were on world championships silver medallist in air rifle Anjum Moudgil in the preliminary round of the 3P event. But Samra was in a different zone on Sunday, shooting superb series in all three positions to emerge second best at the end of the qualification round with a score of 588.

Samra shot a total of 194 (99, 95) in kneeling position, a perfect 200 in prone (100, 100) and 194 in standing (97, 97), while Anjum slipped to 17th with a score of 583. The third Indian, Manini Kaushik, barley missed the eighth and last qualification spot on the count of ‘inner 10s’.

Samra, 21, who had some of the best scores in the trials held in New Delhi ahead of the World Cup, had three awful ‘standing’ rounds in the ranking match, which allowed Zhang and Brabcova to race away to the top.

While the Indian did well in kneeling position — 102.2 (51.7, 50.5) — and prone — 103.4 (51.8, 51.6) –, her ‘standing’ scores let her down. She came up with an average 50.4 in the first standing series but thereafter her scores went down further and she managed just 196.3 (50.4, 49.0, 49.2 and 49.7) in that position to end up with bronze.","India are currently second on the medals table behind China with one gold, one silver and five bronze medals.

India now has one gold, silver and two bronze medals in the competition.

China won both the gold medals on competition day two of the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) World Cup Rifle/Pistol Bhopal, even as India picked up a silver and bronze each at the M.P. Shooting Academy Range here in the outskirts of the city.

Reigning men’s 10m Air Rifle world champion Rudrankksh Patil and R. Narmada Nithin won bronze in the 10m Air Rifle Mixed Team competition while in the day’s second event, Varun Tomar and Rhythm Sangwan won silver to bolster India’s medal haul to one gold, one silver and two bronze medals. China on the other hand lead the standings with three gold and two bronze medals, with Azerbaijan, Germany and Hungary winning a silver medal each thus far.

Rudrankksh and Narmada win bronze in 10m Air Rifle Mixed Team event

In the day’s first medal event, the 10m Air Rifle Mixed Team, the Indian duo of Rudrankksh and Narmada shot a combined 632 in qualification to finish third and thereby qualify for the bronze medal match against China’s Zhang Qiongyue and Yu Haonan, who finished fourth in the 19-strong field with the same combined score.

In the bronze medal match however, both Rudrankksh and Narmada were in their elements, presenting a solid grouping to beat the Chinese pair 16-8 in what was a much closer match than the score line suggests.

Speaking after the match Narmada said, “There was pressure obviously, but then we had a really good match – the competition was so good and we quite enjoyed it.” Rudrankksh said there was no lack of motivation even if they did not win gold. “We were just asked to focus on our process and if we would have got Gold we would have been motivated but the bronze motivates us even more to do better next time,” he said.

Both India and China had entered two teams in the Mixed Team Air Rifle. While the second Chinese team of Huang Yuting and Sheng Lihao won gold defeating Hungarians Istvan Peni and Denes Eszter 16-2 in a one-sided final, the second Indian duo of Hriday Hazarika and Tilottoma Sen shot 628.1 in qualification to finish ninth.

Earlier in qualification, Qian and Liu had topped the nine-team field with a score of 586, while Varun and Rhythm came second with 581.

She came up with an average 50.4 in the first standing series but thereafter her scores went down further and she managed just 196.3 (50.4, 49.0, 49.2 and 49.7) in that position to end up with bronze.","India are currently second on the medals table behind China with one gold, one silver and five bronze medals.

“We apologise for playing the wrong Russian anthem. We request you to give a huge round of applause to Demurchian Anastasiia,” the announcer said after almost all the spectators had left the KD Jadhav Indoor Hall.

Demurchian Anastasiia, who won the gold after defeating Australia’s Scott Kaye Frances, later stood on the podium alone as the correct Russian anthem was played. It is worth mentioning here that the president of the International Boxing Association (IBA), Umar Kremlev, is a Russian.

“The Local Organising Committee took the anthem from the Russian coach, checked it and handed it over to the IBA events team, who are in charge of the entire medal ceremony. There was a meeting regarding this and IBA is doing its own investigation and BFI will fully cooperate with the process,” a Boxing Federation of India (BFI) spokesperson said after the gaffe.

The members of the Russian contingent, however, cheered and applauded their compatriot after lodging their protest following the goof-up.

It is to be noted that over 10 countries including USA, Britain, Ireland and Netherlands boycotted the tournament because the International Boxing Association (IBA) allowed the Russian and Belarusian boxers to compete under their respective flags.","In an embarrassing moment for hosts India and boxing’s global governing body, the Russian national anthem was played incorrectly during the 70kg medal ceremony of the Women’s World Championships here on Saturday.

Sukhu tells Sukhbir Siwach this can weaken democracy in the country, and justifies water cess on hydropower projects in Himachal Pradesh even though Punjab and Haryana are opposing this move. Excerpts:

Do you think Rahul Gandhi’s disqualification from Parliament may lead to a change in political equations in the country?

Rahul Gandhi’s disqualification from Parliament is a political conspiracy. There is only one leader (Rahul Gandhi) in the country who is honestly voicing people’s sentiments in the public court. There is no other leader who is raising the BJP failures inside and outside the House. There is an atmosphere of fear. Us dar ko Rahul Gandhi nikalana chahte hain (Rahul Gandhi wants to get rid of this fear). This is a battle to save democracy, and this is not an individual battle of Rahul Gandhi.”

What will be the fallout of this episode?

Such politics will weaken democracy and the (Constitutional) institutions. Democracy can be alive only if the Opposition is alive.

Do you think the politics of the country may take a new turn after this episode?

At this stage, it’s not appropriate to say where we will reach before the next Lok Sabha elections. But I believe the public knows all — what is happening and where.

Can it prove counterproductive for your opponents?

Certainly, it can. Being the strongest leader of the biggest Opposition party, he (Rahul Gandhi) was disqualified to suppress his voice. But Rahul Gandhi is a leader who walks on the path of truth and he is not going to be scared.

Will you make efforts to unite the Opposition on Rahul’s disqualification?

Our high command will do that. All the Opposition parties have to be united to save democracy. It does not matter who becomes Prime Minister in 2024.

What do you think about water cess on hydropower projects?

Advertisement

When dams are built and electricity is produced, it leads to evaporation and fog which impacts cities. The cess will be imposed on the people of Himachal too who make dams and produce electricity. The formula of water cess was imposed in Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Jammu Kashmir much earlier but we have introduced it just now.

Will this move not impact Punjab and Haryana?

There will be no impact on Haryana and Punjab but only on those who are engaged in power generation like BBMB (Bhakra Beas Management Board). The water cess will be imposed on the electricity generated from BBMB’s dams (situated in Himachal Pradesh). Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have shares in the power generated from these dams. The water cess will be imposed on all 172 hydro-projects, including Himachal Pradesh’s electricity board, power corporation and private projects.

Do you think there will be no financial implications for Punjab and Haryana?

There may be financial implications for these states but imposition of such a cess is a right of Himachal Pradesh. There are no such power projects of Punjab and Haryana (in Himachal Pradesh), so they should not oppose.","Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, 59, is actively campaigning to oppose disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Parliament.

Archana won the 100m in 11.52 seconds, 0.22 seconds ahead of Hima, and the 200m in 23.21 seconds.

The 24-year-old Muhammed Ajmal clocked a sub-47 second time this season, improving on the 46.90 seconds that helped him to win the AFI National 400m Championships title earlier this month.

Despite winning the National Games crown in 46.29 seconds, he was only fifth best Indian in 2022 and will be looking to establish himself as the leading quarter miler in the Asian Games this year.

With a best of 19.76m, the left-handed Tajinderpal Singh Toor dominated the men’s shot put.

Each of his four valid efforts were better than the 19.17m that his Punjab team-mate Karanveer Singh managed to edge out Sahib Singh (Delhi) and claim the second place.

Toor, however, is still looking for his first 20m effort of the year. Commonwealth Games gold medallist Eldhose Paul (Kerala) won the men’s triple jump contest with a best effort of 16.27m.

Karthik Unnikrishnan and Abdulla Aboobacker ensured a podium sweep for Kerala, with the former getting his nose ahead by a mere 3 cm. Interestingly, the Commonwealth Games silver medallist Abdulla Aboobacker cleared 15.77m in his only valid try.

Muhammed Anas Yahiya won his first national-level race since returning from the Commonwealth Games last year.

He clocked 21.54 seconds to push Maldives’ Hassan Saaid to second place. Earlier, Sanjeet Singh (Haryana) edged out Amiya Kumar Mallick (Odisha) by a hundredth of a second in the men’s 100m.

The 2018 Asian Games 1500m gold medallist Jinson Johnson returned to the track for only his second race since he finished fifth at the World Military Games in Wuhan, China, in October 2019.

AMRITSAR: Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, who had convened a meeting of panthic organisations on Monday, issued a 24-hour ultimatum for the release of all supporters of Khalistan sympathiser Amritpal Singh , arrested by the Punjab police since the launch of its crackdown on March 18.The jathedar, on Saturday, had urged the fugitive chief of Waris Punjab De to surrender and face the legal process.The meeting decided that if the ultimatum is not honoured, the Akal Takht will launch ‘Khalsa Wahir’ to expose the government’s machinations at the village-level. Amritpal was to start the second leg of his 'Khalsa Wahir' from March 19. The jathedar said that during this Wahir apart from propagation of the religion, an anti-drug campaign would also be carried out.“All the Sikh bodies, including SGPC and SAD will go to people and highlight how the Sikhs are being terrorised and defamed,” SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said while briefing the media.The meeting also held the Punjab and the central governments along with a few national media houses responsible for creating an atmosphere of hatred against the Sikhs as part of a ‘conspiracy’. The jathedar has directed SGPC to take legal action against the “forces bent upon defaming Sikhs in India and abroad and we have already set up a panel of lawyers for this”.The representatives ofSikh bodies issued another ultimatum to restore the 100-odd Sikh channels closed by the Punjab government . They asked all the Sikh bodies to unitedly fight against the alleged suppression of Sikhs.At the meeting in Akal Takht, a few Sikhs raised slogans in favour of Khalistan, in support of Amritpal and against some national media houses.The meeting also agreed to provide free legal support to all those arrested during the ongoing operation against Amritpal. “The jathedar has issued an open invitation to all the families whosechildren have been arrested in unnecessary cases to contact SGPC. Our panel of lawyers will contest their cases and the SGPC will pay the fees of lawyers already hired by the aggrieved families,” Dhami said.The Sikh bodies also decided to move the high court against the imposition of the stringent National Security Act against the seven Sikhs.Expressing concern over false representation of flags of different Sikh states, including Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s empire, as Khalistan flags bythe police, the Akal Takht Jathedar directed SGPC to take action against police officials. He also urged Sikhs to fly flags of ‘Khalsa Raj’ atop their houses and on their vehicles.Observing that a diplomatic conspiracy was being hatched against Sikhs, the Jathedar said the Sikhs should reply in diplomatic terms and not violently.Despite some differences, all the panthic representatives unanimously decided to abide by the jathedar’s decisions. Prominent among those present at the meeting were Golden Temple head granthi Giani Jagtar Singh, TakhtKesgarh Sahib Baljit Singh Jathedar Giani Raghubir Singh, SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami, Shiromani Panth Akali Buddha Dal’s Baba Balvir Singh, Baba Avtar Singh Sursingh, former Akal Takht jathedar Jasvir Singh Rode, former Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief Manjit Singh GK, and Damdami Taksal representative Sukhdev Singh.Baljit Singh Daduwal, former head of Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC), which is at odds with SGPC over control of Haryana gurdwaras, said he was not allowed to attend the meeting. Akal Takht had issued an open invitation for the special meeting, said Daduwal, so he had decided to attend it but the entry was restricted to a few select groups. “I arrived to attend the meeting, but only paid obeisance at Golden Temple and Akal Takht for the release of the Sikh youth,” he said. “The jathedar represents the community and not a particular group or a family, so everyone should have been invited.”","02:00 Amritpal Singh's 'Seven Faces' released by Punjab Police; suspects he might have changed appearance02:00 Amritpal Singh: How did the Khalistani preacher give police the slip02:35 Amritpal Singh arrest: Who funds terror in Punjab?

A new video of Amritpal Singh with his key aide Papalpreet Singh surfaced on social media on Tuesday, showing the pro-Khalistan preacher without a turban and wearing a mask.

The video has emerged a day after a picture of Amritpal Singh and Papalpreet Singh widely circulated on social media. That image showed both these men looking relaxed and Amritpal Singh holding a beverage can.

Papalpreet Singh is said to be Amritpal Singh’s mentor. He was allegedly in contact with Pakistan’s spy agency ISI.

Several images and videos of the radical preacher have surfaced on social media since the police crackdown on him and his outfit Waris Punjab De began on March 18. Amritpal Singh, however, managed to dodge the crackdown in Jalandhar and escaped in different vehicles by changing his appearance multiple times, police said.

They said Amritpal Singh and Papalpreet Singh were allegedly harboured by a woman at her home in Shahabad in Haryana’s Kurukshetra district on March 19.

On March 25, CCTV footage emerged purportedly showing Amritpal Singh talking on a mobile phone.

The police action began about three weeks after Amritpal Singh and his supporters stormed the Ajnala police station near Amritsar to secure the release of an arrested man. Six police personnel were injured.

Punjab Police have arrested or detained a number of his associates under criminal cases related to spreading disharmony, attempt to murder and attack, police personnel and creating obstructions in the lawful discharge duty by public servants. They have slapped the stringent National Security Act against some of them.

On Sunday, Punjab Police said they have released 197 people out of 353 taken into preventive custody till then on apprehension of breach of peace and disturbance of law and order.

Sukhu tells Sukhbir Siwach this can weaken democracy in the country, and justifies water cess on hydropower projects in Himachal Pradesh even though Punjab and Haryana are opposing this move. Excerpts:

Do you think Rahul Gandhi’s disqualification from Parliament may lead to a change in political equations in the country?

Rahul Gandhi’s disqualification from Parliament is a political conspiracy. There is only one leader (Rahul Gandhi) in the country who is honestly voicing people’s sentiments in the public court. There is no other leader who is raising the BJP failures inside and outside the House. There is an atmosphere of fear. Us dar ko Rahul Gandhi nikalana chahte hain (Rahul Gandhi wants to get rid of this fear). This is a battle to save democracy, and this is not an individual battle of Rahul Gandhi.”

What will be the fallout of this episode?

Such politics will weaken democracy and the (Constitutional) institutions. Democracy can be alive only if the Opposition is alive.

Do you think the politics of the country may take a new turn after this episode?

At this stage, it’s not appropriate to say where we will reach before the next Lok Sabha elections. But I believe the public knows all — what is happening and where.

Can it prove counterproductive for your opponents?

Certainly, it can. Being the strongest leader of the biggest Opposition party, he (Rahul Gandhi) was disqualified to suppress his voice. But Rahul Gandhi is a leader who walks on the path of truth and he is not going to be scared.

Advertisement

Will you make efforts to unite the Opposition on Rahul’s disqualification?

Our high command will do that. All the Opposition parties have to be united to save democracy. It does not matter who becomes Prime Minister in 2024.

What do you think about water cess on hydropower projects?

Advertisement

When dams are built and electricity is produced, it leads to evaporation and fog which impacts cities. The cess will be imposed on the people of Himachal too who make dams and produce electricity. The formula of water cess was imposed in Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Jammu Kashmir much earlier but we have introduced it just now.

Will this move not impact Punjab and Haryana?

There will be no impact on Haryana and Punjab but only on those who are engaged in power generation like BBMB (Bhakra Beas Management Board). The water cess will be imposed on the electricity generated from BBMB’s dams (situated in Himachal Pradesh). Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have shares in the power generated from these dams. The water cess will be imposed on all 172 hydro-projects, including Himachal Pradesh’s electricity board, power corporation and private projects.

Do you think there will be no financial implications for Punjab and Haryana?

There may be financial implications for these states but imposition of such a cess is a right of Himachal Pradesh. There are no such power projects of Punjab and Haryana (in Himachal Pradesh), so they should not oppose.","Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, 59, is actively campaigning to oppose disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Parliament.

Archana won the 100m in 11.52 seconds, 0.22 seconds ahead of Hima, and the 200m in 23.21 seconds.

The 24-year-old Muhammed Ajmal clocked a sub-47 second time this season, improving on the 46.90 seconds that helped him to win the AFI National 400m Championships title earlier this month.

Despite winning the National Games crown in 46.29 seconds, he was only fifth best Indian in 2022 and will be looking to establish himself as the leading quarter miler in the Asian Games this year.

With a best of 19.76m, the left-handed Tajinderpal Singh Toor dominated the men’s shot put.

Each of his four valid efforts were better than the 19.17m that his Punjab team-mate Karanveer Singh managed to edge out Sahib Singh (Delhi) and claim the second place.

Toor, however, is still looking for his first 20m effort of the year. Commonwealth Games gold medallist Eldhose Paul (Kerala) won the men’s triple jump contest with a best effort of 16.27m.

Karthik Unnikrishnan and Abdulla Aboobacker ensured a podium sweep for Kerala, with the former getting his nose ahead by a mere 3 cm. Interestingly, the Commonwealth Games silver medallist Abdulla Aboobacker cleared 15.77m in his only valid try.

Muhammed Anas Yahiya won his first national-level race since returning from the Commonwealth Games last year.

He clocked 21.54 seconds to push Maldives’ Hassan Saaid to second place. Earlier, Sanjeet Singh (Haryana) edged out Amiya Kumar Mallick (Odisha) by a hundredth of a second in the men’s 100m.

The 2018 Asian Games 1500m gold medallist Jinson Johnson returned to the track for only his second race since he finished fifth at the World Military Games in Wuhan, China, in October 2019.

Having finished third in the Federation Cup in April last year, he tasted victory clocking 3:44.52 on Monday, leaving Delhi’s Rahul and Maharashtra’s Prakash Balu Gadade behind.

AMRITSAR: Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, who had convened a meeting of panthic organisations on Monday, issued a 24-hour ultimatum for the release of all supporters of Khalistan sympathiser Amritpal Singh , arrested by the Punjab police since the launch of its crackdown on March 18.The jathedar, on Saturday, had urged the fugitive chief of Waris Punjab De to surrender and face the legal process.The meeting decided that if the ultimatum is not honoured, the Akal Takht will launch ‘Khalsa Wahir’ to expose the government’s machinations at the village-level. Amritpal was to start the second leg of his 'Khalsa Wahir' from March 19. The jathedar said that during this Wahir apart from propagation of the religion, an anti-drug campaign would also be carried out.“All the Sikh bodies, including SGPC and SAD will go to people and highlight how the Sikhs are being terrorised and defamed,” SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said while briefing the media.The meeting also held the Punjab and the central governments along with a few national media houses responsible for creating an atmosphere of hatred against the Sikhs as part of a ‘conspiracy’. The jathedar has directed SGPC to take legal action against the “forces bent upon defaming Sikhs in India and abroad and we have already set up a panel of lawyers for this”.The representatives ofSikh bodies issued another ultimatum to restore the 100-odd Sikh channels closed by the Punjab government . They asked all the Sikh bodies to unitedly fight against the alleged suppression of Sikhs.At the meeting in Akal Takht, a few Sikhs raised slogans in favour of Khalistan, in support of Amritpal and against some national media houses.The meeting also agreed to provide free legal support to all those arrested during the ongoing operation against Amritpal. “The jathedar has issued an open invitation to all the families whosechildren have been arrested in unnecessary cases to contact SGPC. Our panel of lawyers will contest their cases and the SGPC will pay the fees of lawyers already hired by the aggrieved families,” Dhami said.The Sikh bodies also decided to move the high court against the imposition of the stringent National Security Act against the seven Sikhs.Expressing concern over false representation of flags of different Sikh states, including Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s empire, as Khalistan flags bythe police, the Akal Takht Jathedar directed SGPC to take action against police officials. He also urged Sikhs to fly flags of ‘Khalsa Raj’ atop their houses and on their vehicles.Observing that a diplomatic conspiracy was being hatched against Sikhs, the Jathedar said the Sikhs should reply in diplomatic terms and not violently.Despite some differences, all the panthic representatives unanimously decided to abide by the jathedar’s decisions. Prominent among those present at the meeting were Golden Temple head granthi Giani Jagtar Singh, TakhtKesgarh Sahib Baljit Singh Jathedar Giani Raghubir Singh, SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami, Shiromani Panth Akali Buddha Dal’s Baba Balvir Singh, Baba Avtar Singh Sursingh, former Akal Takht jathedar Jasvir Singh Rode, former Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief Manjit Singh GK, and Damdami Taksal representative Sukhdev Singh.Baljit Singh Daduwal, former head of Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC), which is at odds with SGPC over control of Haryana gurdwaras, said he was not allowed to attend the meeting. Akal Takht had issued an open invitation for the special meeting, said Daduwal, so he had decided to attend it but the entry was restricted to a few select groups. “I arrived to attend the meeting, but only paid obeisance at Golden Temple and Akal Takht for the release of the Sikh youth,” he said. “The jathedar represents the community and not a particular group or a family, so everyone should have been invited.”","02:00 Amritpal Singh's 'Seven Faces' released by Punjab Police; suspects he might have changed appearance02:00 Amritpal Singh: How did the Khalistani preacher give police the slip02:35 Amritpal Singh arrest: Who funds terror in Punjab?

A new video of Amritpal Singh with his key aide Papalpreet Singh surfaced on social media on Tuesday, showing the pro-Khalistan preacher without a turban and wearing a mask.

The undated CCTV footage, said to be from a market in Delhi, showed the fugitive walking down a street wearing dark glasses. Behind him, Papalpreet Singh could be seen walking with a bag.

There is no official word from Punjab Police on the fresh footage.

The video has emerged a day after a picture of Amritpal Singh and Papalpreet Singh widely circulated on social media. That image showed both these men looking relaxed and Amritpal Singh holding a beverage can.

Papalpreet Singh is said to be Amritpal Singh’s mentor. He was allegedly in contact with Pakistan’s spy agency ISI.

Several images and videos of the radical preacher have surfaced on social media since the police crackdown on him and his outfit Waris Punjab De began on March 18. Amritpal Singh, however, managed to dodge the crackdown in Jalandhar and escaped in different vehicles by changing his appearance multiple times, police said.

They said Amritpal Singh and Papalpreet Singh were allegedly harboured by a woman at her home in Shahabad in Haryana’s Kurukshetra district on March 19.

On March 25, CCTV footage emerged purportedly showing Amritpal Singh talking on a mobile phone.

The police action began about three weeks after Amritpal Singh and his supporters stormed the Ajnala police station near Amritsar to secure the release of an arrested man. Six police personnel were injured.

Punjab Police have arrested or detained a number of his associates under criminal cases related to spreading disharmony, attempt to murder and attack, police personnel and creating obstructions in the lawful discharge duty by public servants. They have slapped the stringent National Security Act against some of them.

On Sunday, Punjab Police said they have released 197 people out of 353 taken into preventive custody till then on apprehension of breach of peace and disturbance of law and order.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh at his residence.",2023-03-30 09:42:48+05:30,Experts reckon Peter Bol alleged botched test could have “potentially massive” global ramifications: Guardian,"The Guardian reported that Sport Integrity Australia and the government laboratory accused of botching Peter Bol’s anti-doping test sample are staying silent as pressure builds and experts believe it could have “potentially massive” global ramifications.

The Tokyo 2020 star and Commonwealth Games silver medallist Bol had tested positive for synthetic erythropoietin, a performance-enhancing drug, in January. But last month his B-sample returned an atypical finding, allowing Bol to return to competition, according to Guardian.

Details of two independent scientific reports commissioned by Bol’s lawyers became public on Wednesday and both found no evidence of synthetic EPO in Bol’s samples, raising questions about testing methods used in his case.

EPO is a naturally occurring hormone but a synthetic equivalent can aid performance and improve recovery. In a letter providing the reports to SIA, Bol’s lawyer Peter Greene described the body as “completely wrong” and called on it to end the investigation and admit its mistake, according to Australian Guardian.

SIA and the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory, a government body which tests for SIA, stayed silent on Wednesday, refusing to respond to Greene’s allegations, the Guardian reported. SIA and ASDTL declined multiple requests for comment.

“The Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory carries out testing on behalf of Sport Integrity Australia,” the ASDTL said. “It would not be appropriate to comment on an operational matter of Sport Integrity Australia.”

Bol’s agent, James Templeton, hit out at SIA, telling Guardian Australia he was disappointed it had not yet dropped the investigation and cleared the athlete’s name. “SIA are being disingenuous in stating that they are still investigating,” he said. “They have nothing to investigate.”

Templeton said SIA had postponed an interview with Bol in February, a month after they had downloaded everything from his electronic devices. “They have nothing to ask him – zero,” the agent added to Guardian. “It’s despicable to continue to throw shade on Peter Bol. They don’t have the good grace to properly clear his name.”

Observers are highlighting the international significance of Wednesday’s developments. Sports integrity expert Catherine Ordway, a research lead at the University of Canberra and senior fellow at the University of Melbourne Law School, told Guardian there would be major ramifications if the World Anti-Doping Agency accepted the independent reports.

“This is an international issue for Wada,” she was quoted as saying by Guardian. “It will impact the Sydney lab, and any of the other Wada-accredited labs doing EPO testing. It will impact previous EPO cases and future EPO analysis. It is potentially massive, and much bigger than Australia”

But Ordway suggested that more time was needed for Wada’s expert group to review the independent reports and either concede that errors had been made, or suggest an alternative explanation. “The information from [Bol’s lawyers] looks damning, but I’m not a scientist and I’m really keen to see what Wada comes back with.”

Guardian spoke to a prominent Australian sports lawyer, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about the saga, calling the situation a “farce”. They described it as “the least likely of all the outcomes, but certainly the best outcome for Bol’s sake.” The lawyer added: “I hope [SIA] drop this, apologise and move on. ”

The allegedly botched testing was carried out by the ASDTL, a Wada-accredited lab at the National Measurement Institute, part of the federal Department of Industry. The independent reports are highly critical of the testing methods used.

The first report, by Prof David Chen at the University of British Columbia, Guardian reported, noted that the lab “should have immediately recognised” issues with the testing and “followed the procedure described in the Wada Technical Document [TD].”

Chen identified that “another obvious phenomenon that should have been noticed, but wasn’t, is the intense band” observed on one of the samples. Research has shown that people who have recently taken synthetic EPO do not have high levels of naturally occurring EPO. “The gel pattern … showed very strong [natural EPO] intensity, indicating it did not come from a person [who] recently used [synthetic EPO],” Chen wrote in his report, as reported by Guardian.

The researcher was also critical of “the poor quality of the standards”. Chen concluded “the reported finding of [a positive result] was improper and did not meet the criteria required by the WADA TD.

The second report, by Norwegian researchers Prof Jon Nissen-Meyer, Prof Erik Boye, Prof Bjarne Østerud and Tore Skotland, made similarly critical findings. The report said that “we have carefully evaluated the documents that report the tests performed on Peter Bol’s A-sample and find no scientific evidence in this document which proves the presence of synthetic EPO in Bol’s urine.”

Chen was engaged independently by a third party and was kept unaware of the identity of Bol, as per Guardian. The Norwegian experts were engaged directly by Bol’s lawyers, but in an independent, unpaid capacity.","The Guardian reported that Sport Integrity Australia and the government laboratory accused of botching Peter Bol’s anti-doping test sample are staying silent as pressure builds and experts believe it could have “potentially massive” global ramifications.

This will also eliminate the risk of default and no adverse impact on client pay-out.“It shall bring efficiency in the secondary market by allowing usage of the same blocked amount towards margin and settlement obligations and thus result in lower working capital requirements,” Sebi said.","MUMBAI: The Sebi board on Wednesday approved ASBA-like facility for secondary market trading where the funds earmarked for trading by an investor will be blocked and released only when there is a demand from the clearing corporation to settle such trades.

In an open letter to IOC chief Thomas Bach and executive board members before their meeting in Lausanne on Tuesday, the IBA said it had “deep concerns” regarding basic IOC governance, impartiality and transparency principles during the monitoring process ahead of next year’s Paris Olympics.

The IOC suspended the IBA in 2019 over governance, finance, refereeing and ethical issues and did not involve it in running the boxing events at the Tokyo Olympics. The IOC also plans to stage its own boxing qualifier for Paris.

The IBA said it was concerned about confidential data relating to its competition officials, adding that the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit had contacted it about acting as volunteer officials at qualification competitions and the Games.

“This was done without prior approval or communication to IBA with whom the competition officials are certified and showed a lack of basic communication that demonstrates once again the lack of transparency and cooperation with the IBA from the respective IOC staff,” the IBA said in its letter.

It added the IOC’s actions were in breach of a data transfer agreement signed in 2019.

“The IOC is aware of the IBA’s most recent allegations,” an IOC spokesperson told Reuters.

“The IOC will continue to monitor the practice and activities of the IBA in conformity with the roadmap previously communicated to them and in view of taking a decision on their recognition status in 2023.”

The IBA added it would “reserve all rights to seek redress before the competent court against IOC to request damages for breach of the agreement, illegitimate use of our intellectual property and breach of the General Data Protection Regulation amongst other breaches in which the IOC has committed.”

Relations between the IOC and the IBA further soured following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year.

Amateur boxing’s governing body defied IOC guidance and lifted a ban on Russian and Belarusian boxers competing under their flags last October.

The decision by the International Table Tennis Federation paves the way for players from Russia and its ally Belarus to end a year-long exclusion from competitions during Russia’s war in Ukraine. They could resume competing from May at the earliest “under strict conditions of neutrality” and can’t enter the world championships in late May because they have missed the qualification events, the ITTF said.

Table tennis is following a framework presented by the IOC on Tuesday which also recommended excluding any Russians and Belarusians who are contracted to the military, and allowing them to only take part as individuals, not teams. The ITTF said it would create its own guidelines drawing on the IOC recommendations but didn’t commit to any specific measures.

The ITTF justified its decision by the example of “ping pong diplomacy,” when American table tennis players traveled to China in 1971 to play a series of exhibition games which helped thaw relations between the two countries during the Cold War.

“Table tennis has a long history of bringing people together even when political ties have been tenuous,” the ITTF said. “It can build bridges, leading to better understanding among peoples, and open the door for peacebuilding in ways that exclusion and division cannot.”

Table tennis is the first sport to commit to readmitting Russians and Belarusians since the IOC published its guidelines. Two other Olympic sports, judo and fencing, had committed to doing so earlier in 2023 but haven’t held any competitions this year with Russian or Belarusian athletes.

Tennis and cycling allow individual Russians and Belarusians to compete in tour events but not in national team competitions.","Russian players are set to return to table tennis events after the sport’s governing body on Thursday followed the International Olympic Committee’s advice to let them compete as neutrals.

New Delhi, March 28

After the Twitter handles of many Punjabi journalists were withheld, the Twitter now blocks the official account of BBC Punjabi, a news organisation. The decision is learnt to have been taken by the Twitter on the request of the Union Government.

The government — in its request to the Twitter — had claimed that BBC Punjabi had violated the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, while doing stories on the fugitive Amritpal Singh.

Amritpal has been on the run since the police crackdown on March 18.

Earlier, the Twitter accounts of many Punjabi journalists, who had been covering the crackdown against Amritpal, were withheld in India. The government had also withheld the Twitter accounts of Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh, poet Rupi Kaur, voluntary organisation United Sikhs, MP from Sangrur Simranjit Singh Mann and three prominent Punjab-based journalists.

Sources said over 70 Twitter handles and many YouTube channels had been blocked ever since the crackdown against Amritpal started. AAP convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had already claimed that the AAP government in Punjab got the support of the Union government in the crackdown against Amritpal.

Later in the day, the suspension of BBC Punjabi’s Twitter handle was revoked and the account was restored.","Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 28After the Twitter handles of many Punjabi journalists were withheld, the Twitter now blocks the official account of BBC Punjabi, a news organisation.

A decision to this effect was taken by the council of Ministers in its meeting held here at the Punjab Civil Secretariat- I under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister.

Divulging more details a spokesperson of the Chief Minister’s Office said that keeping in view the loss incurred by the farmers recently due to heavy rains, hailstorms and strong winds, the Cabinet has decided to enhance the relief amount from Rs.12,000/- per acre to Rs.15,000/- per acre for 76-100 percent for loss of crops. This measure will give a healing touch to the affected farmers who will be able to get a reasonable financial relief from the government. These relief rates will be applicable from March 1, 2023.

Nod to extend exemption of 2.25% stamp duty and fees land registration by April 30

Keeping in view the larger public interest, the Cabinet also gave its consent to extend the exemption of 2.25% stamp duty and fees to those registering their property/land by April 30. Those opting for registration of land will now be exempted from 1% Additional stamp duty, 1 % PIDB fees and 0.25 % special fees.

Advertisement. Listen to this...",2023-04-02 20:52:29+05:30,"At Rajput mahapanchayat in Jaipur, Karni Sena pushes for higher EWS quota, welfare board","Months before the Assembly elections in Rajasthan, a Rajput outfit on Sunday demanded an increase in the reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) from 10 per cent to 14 per cent at a “Kesariya Mahapanchayat” in Jaipur. The Mahapanchayat was organised by the Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena (SRRKS).

“We want our rights. This gathering is not political but this Kesariya Mahapanchayat has been convened to demand from the government the rights of our youth. We demand that the EWS reservation be increased from 10 per cent to 14 per cent and that the state government constitute a Kshatriya Rajput Kalyan Board. The Central government should relax the conditions of EWS reservation in Central government recruitment,” said SRRKS national president Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi.

“We want a relaxation of five years in age and also similar relaxations in educational qualifications when it comes to the EWS category, as is available to other reserved categories. Our ancestors have always sacrificed for this country and the Hindu religion,” said Gogamedi.

Among those in attendance were BJP MP from Kaiserganj in Uttar Pradesh Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and Raghuraj Singh, MoS in the Uttar Pradesh government.

“The government said that the Rajput men who helped the police nab the assailants of Kanhaiya Lal will be awarded government jobs. What happened to that promise? Do you want us to protest with lakhs of community members?” said Gogamedi.

The Gogamedi-led SRRKS is one of the two major Karni Senas in Rajasthan, the other being the Shree Rajput Karni Sena (SRKS). During the time of the previous BJP government, both the Karni Senas had protested against the BJP — a party traditionally supported by Rajputs — over issues such as the encounter of gangster Anandpal Singh and the sidelining of Rajput leaders such as former Union minister Jaswant Singh by former chief minister Vasundhara Raje.

At the Kesariya Mahapanchayat held on Sunday, the Karni Sena paid tribute to Rajput leader Lokendra Singh Kalvi, who died recently. The Mahapanchayat was the latest among a string of caste Mahapanchayats. Earlier, Jat and Brahmin communities had held similar events at the same venue near the Vidhyadhar Nagar stadium.

Advertisement. Listen to this...",2023-04-02 20:52:29+05:30,"At Rajput mahapanchayat in Jaipur, Karni Sena pushes for higher EWS quota, welfare board","Months before the Assembly elections in Rajasthan, a Rajput outfit on Sunday demanded an increase in the reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) from 10 per cent to 14 per cent at a “Kesariya Mahapanchayat” in Jaipur. The Mahapanchayat was organised by the Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena (SRRKS).

“We want our rights. This gathering is not political but this Kesariya Mahapanchayat has been convened to demand from the government the rights of our youth. We demand that the EWS reservation be increased from 10 per cent to 14 per cent and that the state government constitute a Kshatriya Rajput Kalyan Board. The Central government should relax the conditions of EWS reservation in Central government recruitment,” said SRRKS national president Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi.

“We want a relaxation of five years in age and also similar relaxations in educational qualifications when it comes to the EWS category, as is available to other reserved categories. Our ancestors have always sacrificed for this country and the Hindu religion,” said Gogamedi.

Among those in attendance were BJP MP from Kaiserganj in Uttar Pradesh Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and Raghuraj Singh, MoS in the Uttar Pradesh government.

“The government said that the Rajput men who helped the police nab the assailants of Kanhaiya Lal will be awarded government jobs. What happened to that promise? Do you want us to protest with lakhs of community members?” said Gogamedi.

The Gogamedi-led SRRKS is one of the two major Karni Senas in Rajasthan, the other being the Shree Rajput Karni Sena (SRKS). During the time of the previous BJP government, both the Karni Senas had protested against the BJP — a party traditionally supported by Rajputs — over issues such as the encounter of gangster Anandpal Singh and the sidelining of Rajput leaders such as former Union minister Jaswant Singh by former chief minister Vasundhara Raje.

At the Kesariya Mahapanchayat held on Sunday, the Karni Sena paid tribute to Rajput leader Lokendra Singh Kalvi, who died recently. The Mahapanchayat was the latest among a string of caste Mahapanchayats. Earlier, Jat and Brahmin communities had held similar events at the same venue near the Vidhyadhar Nagar stadium.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh at his residence.,2023-03-31 21:03:59+05:30,Oscar Pistorius denied parole for murder of Reeva Steenkamp; parole board says he hasn’t served enough time,"Former Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius was denied parole on Friday and will have to stay in prison at least another year and four months after it was decided that he had not served the “minimum detention period” required to be released following his murder conviction for the 2013 killing of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

The parole board hearing Pistorius’ application ruled he would be able to apply again in August 2024, South Africa’s Department of Corrections said in a statement. The board cited a new clarification on Pistorius’ sentence that was issued by South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal three days ago, according to the statement.

The result was a surprise but there has been legal wrangling over when Pistorius should be eligible for parole because of the series of appeals in his case. He was initially convicted of culpable homicide, a charge comparable to manslaughter, in 2014 but the case went through a number of appeals before Pistorius was finally sentenced to 13 years and five months in prison for murder in 2017.

Serious offenders must serve at least half their sentence to be eligible for parole in South Africa and Pistorius’ lawyers had gone to court to argue that he was now eligible because he had served the required portion of time in jail from late 2014 following his culpable homicide conviction.

June Steenkamp, the mother of Reeva Steenkamp, attended Pistorius’ hearing Friday to oppose his parole. The parents of Reeva Steenkamp have said they still do not believe Pistorius’ account of their daughter’s killing.

Pistorius has always claimed he killed Steenkamp in the pre-dawn hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 after mistaking her for a dangerous intruder in his home. The Steenkamps said they think he killed her intentionally after a late-night argument and want him to stay in prison.","The parole board hearing Pistorius’ application ruled he would be able to apply again in August 2024, South Africa’s Department of Corrections said in a statement.

LATEST NEWS. Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh · Kerala Blasters · Neeraj Chopra · Mumbai Indians · Arjun tendulkar.,2023-03-31 10:01:20+00:00,Venkatesh Iyer yearns to regain his mojo at KKR in IPL 2023,"In 2021, Venkatesh Iyer suddenly found himself in the arclight with his exploits in the purple and gold of the Kolkata Knight Riders. The side, having experimented with nine other opening combinations since 2019 without much success, finally found the answer to its batting woes in PowerPlay overs in the unheralded all-rounder from Indore.

The arrival of Iyer, right after the five-month COVID-induced hiatus, was like a whiff of fresh air. Opening alongside Shubman Gill, the 6-foot-4-inch-tall left-handed batter helped the team register back-to-back wins against Virat Kohli’s Royal Challengers Bangalore and archrival Mumbai Indians led by the exuberant Rohit Sharma. He scored 41 not out vs RCB, and 53 vs MI. In that edition, he ended up scoring 370 runs in 10 matches at an average of 41.11.

His consistent performances didn’t go unnoticed and November, 2021 was when Iyer arguably lived his best 30 days. Immediately after being fast-tracked into the Indian white-ball team for the New Zealand series, he was retained by KKR ahead of the following season. The figure was ₹8 crore, which translates to a mind-boggling 3900 per cent annual hike in his salary!

The grin says it all! 😊



A moment to cherish for @ivenkyiyer2512 as he makes his #TeamIndia debut. 👏 👏#INDvNZ@Paytmpic.twitter.com/2cZJWZBrXf — BCCI (@BCCI) November 17, 2021

All that cash, besides of course making Iyer way richer, even changed his perspective. “Life has changed in a manner where I’ve started looking at things more professionally. Obviously, when you play more cricket, you tend to bring professionalism into everything. But, that’s how life has changed my approach towards the game. I know that I have to be precise and professional when it comes to each and everything. And yeah, I’ve learned a lot... I now feel that I need to be more professional, more focused than I ever was,” he says.

The hefty investment, however, fetched modest returns in the first year. Iyer’s IPL batting average dropped to 16.54 in 2022, his top score being an unbeaten half-century against Mumbai. It was his only fifty of the season, compared to the four he had clobbered in the previous iteration of the league.

Even in India colours, he failed to make heads turn. In seven T20I innings, he scored 133. In two ODIs, he could only get 24.

The hullabaloo had suddenly died down and he was dropped from the national side. The Knights, however, have decided to go ahead with him in the upcoming edition once again and Iyer is thankful. He says, “KKR has faith in me. As a cricket franchise, they understand that you’re not going to have a good season every time. More than performances, they are looking at the attitude a player brings to the team. They look at the approach and see whether the guy is sincere and putting in the hard yards.”

A familiar face in the KKR dugout might help Iyer to quickly find his feet again. The two-time champion franchise has appointed Chandrakant Pandit, who led Madhya Pradesh to its maiden Ranji Trophy title in 2022, as head coach. “I have worked with Chandu sir (at MP) for about three years now. It’s been an amazing journey. And I’m really excited to work with him in KKR. We all know that he’s a taskmaster, a master tactician, so I’m waiting to see how he takes the stage in IPL,” Iyer tells Sportstar.

Venkatesh Iyer’s figures under the tutelage of Chandrakant Pandit at Madhya Pradesh First-Class: 1 match, 26 runs, HS: 19, Ave: 13 List-A: 11 matches, 652 runs, HS: 198, Ave: 58.88, 100s: 3, 50s: 1; 12 wickets, BBI 3/55, Eco. 5.62 T20s: 14 matches, 571 runs, HS: 88*, Ave: 63.44, 50s: 6; 13 wickets, BBI 6/20, Eco. 8.25

He added, “Coaching is not just about tactics, it’s about man management. Knowing your players, knowing your resources in and out. We do share a good chemistry and that’s going to help. Chandu sir has been so successful because of the way he man-manages at micro level (sic). The time he takes to understand people is very less. That is a skill. He knows how to get the best out of a certain player.”

While Pandit’s coming on board is good news, KKR has also been dealt a major blow. It would have to start the season in the absence of skipper Shreyas Iyer. His lower-back issue might not see the star batter return this season at all, although it is being widely reported that the 28-year-old has decided to delay his surgery and visit the National Cricket Academy (NCA) to undergo periodic treatment. In the meantime, Nitish Rana has been asked to step in.

Iyer wishes the senior Iyer well. “Let’s hope for the best. More than the IPL or anything else, we all want Shreyas to be 100 per cent fit. We all want him to play everything.”

Although Shreyas’ unavailability will botch the tactical equations to a considerable extent, the team looks forward to the season with a steely resolve. Iyer says, “We’re going to be ruthless this season as always. KKR is known for playing aggressive cricket. We have been given a clear template on how to go about our business. Chandu sir always emphasises on one thing when it comes to cricket and life - that he wants us to be very disciplined.”

Iyer himself had been struggling with injuries. Last September, he was hit on the neck by a throw from the bowler during a Duleep Trophy game. Although he made a quick recovery then, a freak accident in October saw him twist his ankle and miss four months of the domestic season. “I’ve been (unlucky). It was very unfortunate. But then again, these are parts of the game. I couldn’t control it. The only thing in my hand was to do my rehab and get back to playing. I’m really thankful to the staff in NCA, who took really good care of me and the latest update is that a few weeks ago, I was declared 100 per cent fit. I was cleared for all formats.”

On whether he has been briefed about his role in the Knights’ club, Iyer says: “My role remains the same. I’ve spoken to the coaches on how to approach this season, especially since I’m coming back after a long injury gap. The communication has been very clear. I’ve always maintained I want to be flexible as a cricketer - be it batting, bowling or fielding. If I feel that I’m only going to open, then it might be training my mind to a comfortable position. So, I’m ready to bat anywhere in the lineup. Be it opening, middle order or finishing the innings. I’m also ready to provide four overs with the ball to my team. I have the confidence. So as and when required I will not shy away from bowling and maybe picking a few wickets for the team.”

Kolkata had been very active during the trade window.It acquired the services of Afghanistan opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz, and pacers Lockie Ferguson (New Zealand) and Shardul Thakur. During the auctions, it snapped up two proven wicketkeeper-batters in N. Jagadeesan and Litton Das (Bangladesh), while also shoring up the all-rounder department with the likes of David Wiese (Namibia) and Shakib Al Hasan (Bangladesh). Iyer was a happy man when he had a look at the team sheet. “Even before the auction, we already had a set team. We’ve made some very good purchases and overall, I’m really happy with the combination. It’s always a good headache to have multiple players for a single position. We’ve done a great job, the boys are raring to go, ready to prove a point.”

All of Iyer’s four appearances at the Eden Gardens have been in India colours. As the home-away format returns, Iyer will be looking to launch a few maximums into the stands to soak in the “ Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo“ cheer. He says, “It’s been my dream to play an IPL game at the Eden Gardens. To play for KKR in front of a packed crowd and hopefully, Shah Rukh (Khan) bhai cheering for us. These are all moments that I’ve seen only on TV. I wanted to live these moments.”

As the next season beckons, Iyer would be desperate to find his superpowers back again. And there can be no better stage than the IPL to witness that epic moment, for here is where the magic happens.

“I don’t play the IPL with the intention of playing in the Indian team. I just go out there and focus on the task in hand. That’s how I function. I don’t set long-term goals for myself. Right now, my priority is to represent KKR and do well. If I have to come back into the (Indian) team, it will happen if it’s meant to be. The only thing in my hand is to go out there and give my best for my team and leave the rest to God.”","In 2021, Venkatesh Iyer suddenly found himself in the arclight with his exploits in the purple and gold of the Kolkata Knight Riders.
As a cricket franchise, they understand that you’re not going to have a good season every time.
We all know that he’s a taskmaster, a master tactician, so I’m waiting to see how he takes the stage in IPL,” Iyer tells Sportstar.

(With PTI inputs)

BATHINDA: Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Friday accused the Punjab government of trying to create panic by increasing security in Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda ahead of Baisakhi festival .The jathedar again asked radical preacher Amritpal Singh to surrender.He appealed to people to come for the Baisakhi event at Takht Sri Damdama Sahib here in large number. The jathedar asked media not to ""twist"" this statement to suggest that he is calling a 'sarbat khalsa' (congregation of the community) that Amritpal Singh wanted summoned.Fugitive Amritpal Singh, in his two video messages, had asked the jathedar to call a 'sarbat khalsa' on Baisakhi to discuss the issues concerning the community.However, the jathedar had earlier announced a three-day 'gurmat samagam' (religious programme) at Takht Damdama Sahib in Bathinda from April 12 to 15.Harpreet Singh called a special gathering at Takht Damdama Sahib on Friday to discuss the role of Sikh and Punjabi journalism, Sikh media contribution, and challenges the state is facing at present.The gathering comes at a time when concerns about the rise of secessionist forces in the border state are being expressed, especially in the wake of a major law and order breach in Ajnala Police Station attack led by Amritpal Singh, a radical preacher declared fugitive by police.The jathedar called for the formation of a body to track and bust ""anti-Sikh phobia"" or ""Punjab-phobic"" content in the media.""Such an organisation will be formed to track and crack whatever fake news is being circulated,"" he said.Addressing the gathering, the jathedar of the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, said because of the tight security arrangements, only a fraction of the usual number of devotees have come here this time ahead of Baisakhi.""Every year, we see a big gathering which starts from April 5 (for Baisakhi). But (at present), the number of 'sangat' is just 10 per cent. The reason is the panic created by the government,"" he said.""I want to tell the Punjab government through this platform that this strictness has created a panic, and it should be ended,"" he asserted.Referring to certain media reports, the Jathedar said, ""Earlier they said Amritpal Singh will surrender here. Now they will start saying that he will surrender on Baisakhi day, and an attempt will be made to create panic in his name. The government should avoid it.""The jathedar said when such a situation is created, it does not affect only the image of Punjabis and Punjab, but also the government which is ruling Punjab.""At least save your image,"" he said.The jathedar said leaves of police staff in Punjab have been cancelled and they have been asked to be present for duty.""All of them have been sent to Damdama Sahib. What will happen here?"" he said.According to sources, Punjab Police has cancelled the leaves of all its staff till April 14.The jathedar said 10 to 15 lakh Sikh devotees gather here on the occasion of Baisakhi. A flag march was taken out on Thursday while police personnel have been deployed in every nook and cranny, he said.""An attempt was being made to project the situation as dangerous and it was very unfortunate,"" he said.Baisakhi, one of Punjab's biggest festivals in north India, marks the foundation day of the 'Khalsa Panth' (Sikh order) by the 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh. It also marks the onset of harvest season.On the day of the festival, people across Punjab offer prayers at gurdwaras.The jathedar said not even 75 commitments made to the Sikh community by successive governments at the Centre have been fulfilled in the last 75 years.""Even then, we are quiet and even then, we are called secessionists and terrorists. How long will this continue? If you suppress our voice in Punjab, we will speak as Haryanvi from Haryana, as Marathas from Maharashtra, from USA and England,"" he said.We do not want any conflict with the central government, he said, adding only dialogue can resolve matters.Speaking to reporters, the jathedar again asked Amritpal Singh to surrender.""I had earlier appealed to him. He should surrender,"" said the jathedar.He also directed the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the apex religious body of the Sikhs, to file a complaint against the terming of flags of erstwhile Sikh rule as Khalistan flags by police.The jathedar lamented that the SGPC had earlier too been told to file a complaint, but it did not take any meaningful step in the matter.","""Every year, we see a big gathering which starts from April 5 (for Baisakhi).

The tournaments will be conducted at Nandini Nagar, in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh.

These will be the first tournaments conducted by the WFI since January 21, when the Indian government suspended all activities of the federation. The suspended assistant secretary Vinod Tomar cancelled all ongoing tournaments and appointed an Oversight Committee to look into the day-to-day activities of the federation, following public protests by India’s top wrestlers who made allegations of sexual harassment and financial impropriety against the WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

According to WFI general secretary VN Prasood, the WFI had resumed their day-to-day functioning earlier this week after the Oversight Committee submitted a fact-finding report into the allegations made against the WFI president.

The Oversight Committee, which was supposed to conduct the day-to-day activity of the federation was originally to have a term of four weeks to submit its fact-finding report. On 23 rd February, this term was extended to another two weeks.

It is learned that the Oversight Committee had sought the help of the WFI in matters including obtaining visas for international tournaments as well as conducting a selection trial to pick a team for the Asian Championships.

“After the Oversight Committee submitted their report to the government, they also submitted bills for legal costs that they incurred in their activities to the WFI. That meant that their role in running day-to-day activities of the federation is over,” Prasood said. The WFI is also sitting at TOPs (Target Olympic Podium) meetings. Now the Federation says it is looking to conduct tournaments as per its calendar. “When the Federation was suspended, we had to stop the National ranking series after the first day of competition. Now we are completing that tournament as well as conducting the U-17 nationals,” Prasood said.

Prasood added that with the players’ allegations primarily being made against the WFI president, there was no restriction on the WFI itself resuming its activities. “The WFI president is still not involved in the day-to-day activities of the federation,” he said.

While Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh might not be involved in the day-to-day activities of the federation, the tournaments, incidentally, are set to be held on the grounds of Nandini Nagar Mahavidyalaya, which he chairs. The college is located in Gonda which lies in the Kaiserganj Lok Sabha constituency from where Brij Bhushan has been elected multiple times as a Member of Parliament.","These will be the first tournaments conducted by the WFI since January 21, when the Indian government suspended all activities of the federation.

04:28 Amritpal Singh won’t be allowed to surrender at Akal Takht: SGPC Gen Sec Gurcharan Singh

(With PTI inputs)

BATHINDA: Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Friday accused the Punjab government of trying to create panic by increasing security in Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda ahead of Baisakhi festival .The jathedar again asked radical preacher Amritpal Singh to surrender.He appealed to people to come for the Baisakhi event at Takht Sri Damdama Sahib here in large number. The jathedar asked media not to ""twist"" this statement to suggest that he is calling a 'sarbat khalsa' (congregation of the community) that Amritpal Singh wanted summoned.Fugitive Amritpal Singh, in his two video messages, had asked the jathedar to call a 'sarbat khalsa' on Baisakhi to discuss the issues concerning the community.However, the jathedar had earlier announced a three-day 'gurmat samagam' (religious programme) at Takht Damdama Sahib in Bathinda from April 12 to 15.Harpreet Singh called a special gathering at Takht Damdama Sahib on Friday to discuss the role of Sikh and Punjabi journalism, Sikh media contribution, and challenges the state is facing at present.The gathering comes at a time when concerns about the rise of secessionist forces in the border state are being expressed, especially in the wake of a major law and order breach in Ajnala Police Station attack led by Amritpal Singh, a radical preacher declared fugitive by police.The jathedar called for the formation of a body to track and bust ""anti-Sikh phobia"" or ""Punjab-phobic"" content in the media.""Such an organisation will be formed to track and crack whatever fake news is being circulated,"" he said.Addressing the gathering, the jathedar of the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, said because of the tight security arrangements, only a fraction of the usual number of devotees have come here this time ahead of Baisakhi.""Every year, we see a big gathering which starts from April 5 (for Baisakhi). But (at present), the number of 'sangat' is just 10 per cent. The reason is the panic created by the government,"" he said.""I want to tell the Punjab government through this platform that this strictness has created a panic, and it should be ended,"" he asserted.Referring to certain media reports, the Jathedar said, ""Earlier they said Amritpal Singh will surrender here. Now they will start saying that he will surrender on Baisakhi day, and an attempt will be made to create panic in his name. The government should avoid it.""The jathedar said when such a situation is created, it does not affect only the image of Punjabis and Punjab, but also the government which is ruling Punjab.""At least save your image,"" he said.The jathedar said leaves of police staff in Punjab have been cancelled and they have been asked to be present for duty.""All of them have been sent to Damdama Sahib. What will happen here?"" he said.According to sources, Punjab Police has cancelled the leaves of all its staff till April 14.The jathedar said 10 to 15 lakh Sikh devotees gather here on the occasion of Baisakhi. A flag march was taken out on Thursday while police personnel have been deployed in every nook and cranny, he said.""An attempt was being made to project the situation as dangerous and it was very unfortunate,"" he said.Baisakhi, one of Punjab's biggest festivals in north India, marks the foundation day of the 'Khalsa Panth' (Sikh order) by the 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh. It also marks the onset of harvest season.On the day of the festival, people across Punjab offer prayers at gurdwaras.The jathedar said not even 75 commitments made to the Sikh community by successive governments at the Centre have been fulfilled in the last 75 years.""Even then, we are quiet and even then, we are called secessionists and terrorists. How long will this continue? If you suppress our voice in Punjab, we will speak as Haryanvi from Haryana, as Marathas from Maharashtra, from USA and England,"" he said.We do not want any conflict with the central government, he said, adding only dialogue can resolve matters.Speaking to reporters, the jathedar again asked Amritpal Singh to surrender.""I had earlier appealed to him. He should surrender,"" said the jathedar.He also directed the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the apex religious body of the Sikhs, to file a complaint against the terming of flags of erstwhile Sikh rule as Khalistan flags by police.The jathedar lamented that the SGPC had earlier too been told to file a complaint, but it did not take any meaningful step in the matter.","""Every year, we see a big gathering which starts from April 5 (for Baisakhi).
Now they will start saying that he will surrender on Baisakhi day, and an attempt will be made to create panic in his name.

The tournaments will be conducted at Nandini Nagar, in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh.

These will be the first tournaments conducted by the WFI since January 21, when the Indian government suspended all activities of the federation. The suspended assistant secretary Vinod Tomar cancelled all ongoing tournaments and appointed an Oversight Committee to look into the day-to-day activities of the federation, following public protests by India’s top wrestlers who made allegations of sexual harassment and financial impropriety against the WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

According to WFI general secretary VN Prasood, the WFI had resumed their day-to-day functioning earlier this week after the Oversight Committee submitted a fact-finding report into the allegations made against the WFI president.

The Oversight Committee, which was supposed to conduct the day-to-day activity of the federation was originally to have a term of four weeks to submit its fact-finding report. On 23 rd February, this term was extended to another two weeks.

It is learned that the Oversight Committee had sought the help of the WFI in matters including obtaining visas for international tournaments as well as conducting a selection trial to pick a team for the Asian Championships.

“After the Oversight Committee submitted their report to the government, they also submitted bills for legal costs that they incurred in their activities to the WFI. That meant that their role in running day-to-day activities of the federation is over,” Prasood said. The WFI is also sitting at TOPs (Target Olympic Podium) meetings. Now the Federation says it is looking to conduct tournaments as per its calendar. “When the Federation was suspended, we had to stop the National ranking series after the first day of competition. Now we are completing that tournament as well as conducting the U-17 nationals,” Prasood said.

Prasood added that with the players’ allegations primarily being made against the WFI president, there was no restriction on the WFI itself resuming its activities. “The WFI president is still not involved in the day-to-day activities of the federation,” he said.

While Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh might not be involved in the day-to-day activities of the federation, the tournaments, incidentally, are set to be held on the grounds of Nandini Nagar Mahavidyalaya, which he chairs. The college is located in Gonda which lies in the Kaiserganj Lok Sabha constituency from where Brij Bhushan has been elected multiple times as a Member of Parliament.","These will be the first tournaments conducted by the WFI since January 21, when the Indian government suspended all activities of the federation.

In another blow, Indian weightlifter Sanjita Chanu has been handed a four-year ban after failing a dope test last year. The National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) on Tuesday, April 4 announced this decision.



As reported by the NADA, the two-time Commonwealth Games champion was tested positive for an anabolic steroid, called Drostanolone Metabolite. This substance is among the listed prohibited materials by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

The concerned body further added that the 29-year-old weightlifter’s samples were collected during the National Games in Gujarat in the September-October 2022. This decision of the NADA was even confirmed by the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) President Sahdev Yadav. “Yes, she has been handed a four-year ban by NADA,” he told PTI as quoted by TOI.

Seeing this development, the Indian weightlifter will be stripped off her National Games silver medal. The 29-year-old still has the option of appealing the decision made by NADA.

Wrestlers, including but not limited to Phogat, Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia and Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik organised a sit in protest in New Delhi Jantar Mantar in January to protest the functioning of the WFI.

While Brij Bhushan Singh denied the allegations, the Union Sports Ministry asked the BJP MP from Kaiserganj to step down from his role and set up an Oversight Committee to probe the allegations and set a deadline of one month to submit its findings. Phogat, Punia and Malik had expressed their disappointment in not being consulted by the Sports Ministry in the setting up of the OC.

“Why is there secrecy over the findings of the Oversight Committee and the details about how they went about the probe? Women wrestlers have shown the courage to speak about what they faced but it seems like their words don’t matter. We have raised a very sensitive issue which concerns the safety of women wrestlers,” Phogat, a three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist told The Indian Express.

“We have lost faith in the committee. We received some assurances from the government but they were not fulfilled too. We do not know the status of the report filed by the committee as well. Every time we ask what is the status and finding of the Oversight Committee report, there is no response from anyone,” she added.

Phogat also said that she and Punia tried to reach out to OC member MC Mary Kom and Sports Minister Anurag Thakur but received no response.

“We are left with no other option but to approach the court in our fight for justice. Stepping back is not an option now,” Phogat said.

The 28-year-old also alleged that though the Brij Bhushan had been removed from his post of WFI chief, he still runs the day-to-day affairs of the federation. She pointed out that the Open National Senior Ranking Wrestling Tournament for Women and Greco Roman has been scheduled to be held at Nandini Nagar in Gonda from April 16 to 18.

Brij Bhushan hails from Gonda and the district is a part of his Lok Sabha constituency and is considered to be his stronghold.

“Nandini Nagar in Gonda was chosen despite us saying what all had happened to women wrestlers earlier. How can this even happen? When I saw that the venue of the senior ranking tournament was in Gonda, I did try to reach members of the Oversight Committee. But nobody seems to have any answer,” she added.

The OC includes boxing legend and Rajya Sabha member MC Mary Kom, Olympic medalist and former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former badminton player and Mission Olympic Cell member Trupti Murgunde, former CEO of the Target Olympic Podium Scheme Rajesh Rajagopalan, and former Sports Authority of India executive director (teams) Radhica Sreeman.

Later on, 2012 World Championships bronze medal-winning wrestler Babita Phogat was also added to the committee.","Women wrestlers have shown the courage to speak about what they faced but it seems like their words don’t matter.

“Members of the committee had to sign the report before it was submitted to the Sports Ministry. I wrote on the report that I will sign with objections to this report,” the member told Sportstar, on condition of anonymity.

The Sports Ministry on January 23 had appointed a six-person committee, headed by Olympic boxing bronze medallist MC Mary Kom, following public protests by several of India’s top wrestlers at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in January this year. The other members of the committee were former CEO of Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) Capt Rajagopalan, former SAI Executive Director (Teams) Radhika Sreeman, former badminton national champion Trupti Murgunde, Olympic bronze medallist Yogeshwar Dutt and Commonwealth wrestling champion Babita Phogat.

“I was not allowed to read the final report in full and I had objected about it. The report was submitted to the Sports Ministry on the April 5 and that morning, I realised that certain objections I had earlier raised had not been included in the report. When I asked the committee to include these points, this was not done. I signed and registering my protest,” the member said.

The member also raised concerns regarding the committee’s evidence collection method. “I wrote in my objection that no document submitted by witnesses or the Wrestling Federation or recording of witness statement was shared with the members of the committee. None of the witness deposition was signed by either the witness or by the members of the committee. We did not cross-check or verify with any of the witnesses if their testimony was right or wrong. We only recorded what was said. There were individuals who had an incentive to speak in favour of one party,” the member said.

The member further alleged that Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh -- the six-time member of parliament and president of the Wrestling Federation of India -- against whom allegations of harassment had been made, recorded his statement in the absence of a lawyer. “In matters of sexual harassment, all statements are to be taken in the presence of a third party who is a lawyer. This was done in the case of the athletes who had complained, but it was not done for the WFI president,” the member said.

The committee member said objections were raised several times prior to the finalisation of the report. “Any objection I raised during meetings of the committee was not recorded in the minutes of the meeting. When I asked why this was not recorded, I was told that the matter would be discussed later,” the member said. “In this way, my objections were ignored. Decisions were taken unilaterally. When trials to select the team for the Asian Championships were held, I had objections since this was the first time, we had trials where we called U-20 athletes, but several senior players were not able to compete,” added the committee member. Several athletes were later allowed to compete in the trials after approaching the court.

The member added that the committee has not made any suggestions on the most serious allegations raised by the protesting wrestlers. “They have not made any recommendations regarding the various allegations that had been made. I have mentioned in the report that no suggestions have been made which will either support or contradict what the athletes have said,” the member said.","“Members of the committee had to sign the report before it was submitted to the Sports Ministry.

“A news report recently claimed that one of the members of the oversight committee, which was constituted by the sports ministry to probe the allegations, was not in agreement with its final report. It indicates something suspicious is being done either by the committee or the ministry. Someone is doing something wrong,” Punia told The News Indian Express.

On January 23, after weeks of protest by a number of prominent Indian wrestlers, the Union sports ministry constituted a six-member committee headed by Olympic medallist and boxer Mary Kom. The other members of the committee were former CEO of Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) Capt Rajagopalan, former SAI Executive Director (Teams) Radhika Sreeman, former badminton national champion Trupti Murgunde, Olympic bronze medallist Yogeshwar Dutt and Commonwealth wrestling champion Babita Phogat. Phogat was added only after wrestlers expressed displeasure at the committee’s membership.

One of the members of the committee told Sportstar on the condition anonymity that they had objections to the way the committee’s report was drafted and so have signed it with objections.

“Members of the committee had to sign the report before it was submitted to the Sports Ministry. I wrote on the report that I will sign with objections to this report,” the member said. “I was not allowed to read the final report in full and I had objected about it.

We only recorded what was said. There were individuals who had an incentive to speak in favour of one party,” the member continued.

Responding to this report, Punia told The New Indian Express, “Through your newspaper, I wanted to tell the people of this country that the statements given by the women wrestlers against the WFI chief should be made public so that they also know the truth. The whole process was videographed. These videos should be run on news channels. These statements should be made public to decide whether he (Singh) was guilty or not. I don’t know who wants to save him, who all are supporting him. We had faith in the government that it would give justice to us. However, the way things are going on, we don’t feel like the government will support us or go with the truth.”

Two upcoming events announced by the WFI have also come under the scanner, according to The Print, because they are being held in Singh’s stronghold – Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda. Both the U-17 National Championships on April 16 and Senior Open National Ranking Wrestling Tournament on April 18 are to be held at the Nandini Nagar Mahavidyalaya, a college that Singh helped found.

WFI general secretary V.N. Prasood told The Print that the events were being held because the investigation committee had submitted its report to the government.

Punia told The New Indian Express that it was unfair for the WFI to resume functioning without telling the complainants or the public the findings of the probe. “The WFI has resumed its activities even as the report of the oversight committee has not been made public yet. We don’t know whether the committee has submitted its report or not.

Wrestlers, including but not limited to Phogat, Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia and Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik organised a sit in protest in New Delhi Jantar Mantar in January to protest the functioning of the WFI.

While Brij Bhushan Singh denied the allegations, the Union Sports Ministry asked the BJP MP from Kaiserganj to step down from his role and set up an Oversight Committee to probe the allegations and set a deadline of one month to submit its findings. Phogat, Punia and Malik had expressed their disappointment in not being consulted by the Sports Ministry in the setting up of the OC.

“Why is there secrecy over the findings of the Oversight Committee and the details about how they went about the probe? Women wrestlers have shown the courage to speak about what they faced but it seems like their words don’t matter. We have raised a very sensitive issue which concerns the safety of women wrestlers,” Phogat, a three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist told The Indian Express.

“We have lost faith in the committee. We received some assurances from the government but they were not fulfilled too. We do not know the status of the report filed by the committee as well. Every time we ask what is the status and finding of the Oversight Committee report, there is no response from anyone,” she added.

Phogat also said that she and Punia tried to reach out to OC member MC Mary Kom and Sports Minister Anurag Thakur but received no response.

“We are left with no other option but to approach the court in our fight for justice. Stepping back is not an option now,” Phogat said.

The 28-year-old also alleged that though the Brij Bhushan had been removed from his post of WFI chief, he still runs the day-to-day affairs of the federation. She pointed out that the Open National Senior Ranking Wrestling Tournament for Women and Greco Roman has been scheduled to be held at Nandini Nagar in Gonda from April 16 to 18.

Brij Bhushan hails from Gonda and the district is a part of his Lok Sabha constituency and is considered to be his stronghold.

“Nandini Nagar in Gonda was chosen despite us saying what all had happened to women wrestlers earlier. How can this even happen? When I saw that the venue of the senior ranking tournament was in Gonda, I did try to reach members of the Oversight Committee. But nobody seems to have any answer,” she added.

The OC includes boxing legend and Rajya Sabha member MC Mary Kom, Olympic medalist and former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former badminton player and Mission Olympic Cell member Trupti Murgunde, former CEO of the Target Olympic Podium Scheme Rajesh Rajagopalan, and former Sports Authority of India executive director (teams) Radhica Sreeman.

“Members of the committee had to sign the report before it was submitted to the Sports Ministry. I wrote on the report that I will sign with objections to this report,” the member told Sportstar, on condition of anonymity.

The Sports Ministry on January 23 had appointed a six-person committee, headed by Olympic boxing bronze medallist MC Mary Kom, following public protests by several of India’s top wrestlers at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in January this year. The other members of the committee were former CEO of Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) Capt Rajagopalan, former SAI Executive Director (Teams) Radhika Sreeman, former badminton national champion Trupti Murgunde, Olympic bronze medallist Yogeshwar Dutt and Commonwealth wrestling champion Babita Phogat.

“I was not allowed to read the final report in full and I had objected about it. The report was submitted to the Sports Ministry on the April 5 and that morning, I realised that certain objections I had earlier raised had not been included in the report. When I asked the committee to include these points, this was not done. I signed and registering my protest,” the member said.

The member also raised concerns regarding the committee’s evidence collection method. “I wrote in my objection that no document submitted by witnesses or the Wrestling Federation or recording of witness statement was shared with the members of the committee. None of the witness deposition was signed by either the witness or by the members of the committee. We did not cross-check or verify with any of the witnesses if their testimony was right or wrong. We only recorded what was said. There were individuals who had an incentive to speak in favour of one party,” the member said.

The member further alleged that Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh -- the six-time member of parliament and president of the Wrestling Federation of India -- against whom allegations of harassment had been made, recorded his statement in the absence of a lawyer. “In matters of sexual harassment, all statements are to be taken in the presence of a third party who is a lawyer. This was done in the case of the athletes who had complained, but it was not done for the WFI president,” the member said.

The committee member said objections were raised several times prior to the finalisation of the report. “Any objection I raised during meetings of the committee was not recorded in the minutes of the meeting. When I asked why this was not recorded, I was told that the matter would be discussed later,” the member said. “In this way, my objections were ignored. Decisions were taken unilaterally. When trials to select the team for the Asian Championships were held, I had objections since this was the first time, we had trials where we called U-20 athletes, but several senior players were not able to compete,” added the committee member. Several athletes were later allowed to compete in the trials after approaching the court.

The member added that the committee has not made any suggestions on the most serious allegations raised by the protesting wrestlers. “They have not made any recommendations regarding the various allegations that had been made. I have mentioned in the report that no suggestions have been made which will either support or contradict what the athletes have said,” the member said.","“Members of the committee had to sign the report before it was submitted to the Sports Ministry.

“A news report recently claimed that one of the members of the oversight committee, which was constituted by the sports ministry to probe the allegations, was not in agreement with its final report. It indicates something suspicious is being done either by the committee or the ministry. Someone is doing something wrong,” Punia told The News Indian Express.

On January 23, after weeks of protest by a number of prominent Indian wrestlers, the Union sports ministry constituted a six-member committee headed by Olympic medallist and boxer Mary Kom. The other members of the committee were former CEO of Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) Capt Rajagopalan, former SAI Executive Director (Teams) Radhika Sreeman, former badminton national champion Trupti Murgunde, Olympic bronze medallist Yogeshwar Dutt and Commonwealth wrestling champion Babita Phogat. Phogat was added only after wrestlers expressed displeasure at the committee’s membership.

One of the members of the committee told Sportstar on the condition anonymity that they had objections to the way the committee’s report was drafted and so have signed it with objections.

“Members of the committee had to sign the report before it was submitted to the Sports Ministry. I wrote on the report that I will sign with objections to this report,” the member said. “I was not allowed to read the final report in full and I had objected about it.

We only recorded what was said. There were individuals who had an incentive to speak in favour of one party,” the member continued.

Responding to this report, Punia told The New Indian Express, “Through your newspaper, I wanted to tell the people of this country that the statements given by the women wrestlers against the WFI chief should be made public so that they also know the truth. The whole process was videographed. These videos should be run on news channels. These statements should be made public to decide whether he (Singh) was guilty or not. I don’t know who wants to save him, who all are supporting him. We had faith in the government that it would give justice to us. However, the way things are going on, we don’t feel like the government will support us or go with the truth.”

Two upcoming events announced by the WFI have also come under the scanner, according to The Print, because they are being held in Singh’s stronghold – Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda. Both the U-17 National Championships on April 16 and Senior Open National Ranking Wrestling Tournament on April 18 are to be held at the Nandini Nagar Mahavidyalaya, a college that Singh helped found.

WFI general secretary V.N. Prasood told The Print that the events were being held because the investigation committee had submitted its report to the government.

Punia told The New Indian Express that it was unfair for the WFI to resume functioning without telling the complainants or the public the findings of the probe. “The WFI has resumed its activities even as the report of the oversight committee has not been made public yet. We don’t know whether the committee has submitted its report or not. We don’t have any information on it yet,” he said.","One of the members of the committee told Sportstar on the condition anonymity that they had objections to the way the committee’s report was drafted and so have signed it with objections.

They needed 29 runs in the final over against Gujarat Titans in a stunning IPL 2023 match on Sunday, April 9. However, RInku Singh, who was batting with No. 9 batter Umesh Yadav, believed that he could pull it off.

Yash Dayal, the young Gujarat Titans bowler who impressed in his winning campaign in IPL 2022, was handed the responsibility of bowling the final over. KKR's camp looked in distress as they had nearly fluffed a good chance to win. After a 100-run stand between captain Nitish Rana and Venkatesh Iyer (83), Alazarri Joseph struck twice to remove the well-set batters.

Then came Rashid Khan, who redeemed himself after giving away 35 runs in his first 3 overs, by picking up a hat-trick in his final over, sending back Andre Russell, Sunil Narina and Shardul Thakur.

However, Rinku Singh pulled off one of the most stunning chases in the history of IPL, hitting 5 sixes in the final over. 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 read the scoreboard as Rinku was punching the air in delight after breaking the hearts of thousands of Gujarat fans at the Narendra Modi Stadium. KKR pulled off a 205-run chase to clinch their second successive win in IPL 2023.

Reflecting on his stunning onslaught in the final over, Rinku Singh revealed the chat with his captain Nitish, saying the latter had told him to take the chase deep.

""I had belief that I can do this. Rana bhai said to keep belief and to bat till the end, then we will see what happens,"" Riku Singh said.

The left-hander, who fell short of pulling off a similar chase when KKR needed 21 runs in the final over against Lucknow Super Giants last year, said he did not think much but wanted to hit sixes in the final over.

And he did that with a lot of precision. Rinku hit Dayal, who missed his length in a difficult final over.

""I was just trying to hit sixes. (Umesh) Bhaiya was asking me not to think much and just play the ball. I was not thinking a lot, was just reacting to the ball. It kept coming out of the middle, I had belief and it came off in the end,"" Rinku added.

Rinku Singh was awarded the Player of the Match award for his stunning knock in a match that will be remembered for a long, long time in the IPL history.","They needed 29 runs in the final over against Gujarat Titans in a stunning IPL 2023 match on Sunday, April 9.

The 19-year-old competes in the same weight bracket as the veteran and recently won silver in the Asian Championships.

While Vinesh Phogat has established herself as one of the greatest female wrestlers from India, Antim Panghal is making waves and is perceived to have a bright future in the sport. Despite belonging to the same weight class, the two wrestlers have been working on distinctive goals lately. They are none other than three-time Commonwealth Games gold medalist Vinesh Phogat and rising star Antim Panghal.

Why has Vinesh Phogat been out of international events?

For Vinesh, the battle is not just about herself but even a much greater cause. Besides Vinesh, many Indian wrestlers including Tokyo Olympics bronze medalist Bajrang Punia, Rio Olympics medalist Sakshi Malik, and Sangeeta Phogat led the sit-in protest in Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on January 18, 2023, against the Wrestling Federation of India’s (WFI) President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh accusing him and other coaches of sexual misconduct, harassment, and mental torture. Vinesh also stated that ‘at least 10 to 20 girls’ have encountered sexual harassment at the wrestling camps.

The protest led to the stepping down of WFI President Brij Bhushan till the issue was resolved. However, elite wrestlers like Vinesh, Bajrang, and Sakshi opted out from participating in international wrestling tournaments like the United World Wrestling (UWW) Ranking Series tournament until the Indian Sports Ministry’s Oversight Committee submitted their report regarding the case on Brij Bhushan.

Antim Panghal’s performance at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023

However, Vinesh Phogat withdrawing her name from the international wrestling events implied that it was the perfect opportunity for Antim Panghal to become a standout performer in the women’s 53kg event. Antim exactly did so in the absence of her experienced compatriot.

She capitalized on all the chances with her fine performance in the National selection trials conducted under the supervision of the Oversight Committee at the Indira Gandhi Arena. She, thus, booked herself a spot in the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023.

At the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023, the 19-year-old Antim lived up to the expectations by advancing to the finals of the women’s 53kg. On her way to the final, she overcame the challenges from Aktenge Keunimjaeva in the semi-final, Li Deng in the quarter-final, and Alvina Lim during the qualifications. In the final, she faced a stiff challenge from Akari Fujinami, the reigning World champion, and eventually lost by 0-10 to end up with the silver medal.

Vinesh Phogat vs Antim Panghal

Considering Antim’s rise in the sport in such a short span of time, there is no doubt that the women’s 53kg will be an anticipated clash in the coming times, especially at the national level. It is interesting to note that in the matchups held between Antim and Vinesh Phogat, the latter defeated the youngster on two occasions. During the selection trials for Commonwealth Games 2022, the two wrestlers locked horns. Although Antim was leading by 3-0 initially, Vinesh used her experience to turn the tables in her favour.

The next time the two wrestlers met at the National Selection Trials 2022 with the women’s 53kg slot up for grabs for the World Wrestling Championships 2022. Unlike last time, Vinesh was the stronger opponent right from the start as she defeated Antim 7-0 by blocking all of her attacks and striking on the counter. This came just two weeks after Antim had scripted history for India becoming the first-ever U-20 world champion.

Will Antim’s rise in the sport affect Vinesh Phogat’s chances?

Although Vinesh emerged as the better opponent in their previous encounters, Antim has shown tremendous potential in a very short period. This silver medal victory at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023 will surely add up to her confidence. If Vinesh continues to miss out on the selection trials, Antim will be rewarded with experience through her participation at international events against some top-level wrestlers of the world.

The three-time Commonwealth Games champion Vinesh might also miss the opportunity to represent India at prestigious events like Asian Games 2022 if the Sports Ministry decides to send athletes based on their latest performance and records. As a result, she might lose out on a chance to defend her Asian Games title as she was the gold medalist in the Asian Games 2018 held in Jakarta, Indonesia.

The BJP on Wednesday announced its second list of 23 candidates for the May 10 Assembly polls in Karnataka, denying tickets to seven sitting MLAs, including Madal Virupakshappa who was recently arrested on corruption charges.

The party released its first list of 189 candidates on Tuesday.

The latest list does not include Hubli-Dharwad Central segment, from where former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar wants to contest. It also does not include candidate for the Shivamogga city segment, where sitting MLA and former minister K S Eshwarappa has announced his retirement from electoral politics.

Shettar has been asked by the party’s top brass to make way for youngsters, but he has asserted that he wants to contest one last time.

The list includes four Scheduled Caste, one Scheduled Tribe and two women candidates.

Channagiri MLA Virupakshappa, who was recently arrested by Lokayukta police on corruption charges, was among the incumbent MLAs who were not included in the list. Shiv Kumar has been fielded from the Channagiri seat.

In Haveri, sitting MLA Nehru Olekar was replaced by Gavisiddappa Dyamannavar, while in Byndoor, sitting MLA B Sukumar Shetty made way for Gururaj Gantihole.

Mudigere sitting MLA M P Kumaraswamy was dropped and Deepak Doddaiah was named in his place.

Recently, there was a large-scale protest against HD Kumaraswamy by a section of party workers in the constituency, when veteran leader BS Yediyurappa visited there.

Kalghatgi MLA C M Nimbannavar (76) has been replaced by Nagaraj Chabbi who quit Congress and joined the party recently, and in Mayakonda, Basavaraja Naik has been given the ticket instead of sitting MLA N Linganna.

Davangere North MLA S A Ravindranath (76) was denied renomination. Instead, Lokikere Nagraj got the ticket.

Discontent seems to be brewing within the ruling BJP in Karnataka with the party facing the heat after announcing its first list of candidates on Tuesday after some aspirants who missed the bus expressing displeasure.

The party has so far announced candidates for 212 of the total 224 seats.","Karnataka polls: BJP announces second list of 23 candidates, denies tickets to 7 sitting MLAsA A ATeam Udayavani, Apr 13, 2023, 5:55 AM ISTThe BJP on Wednesday announced its second list of 23 candidates for the May 10 Assembly polls in Karnataka, denying tickets to seven sitting MLAs, including Madal Virupakshappa who was recently arrested on corruption charges.

The medal also pushes into sharp context the major issue around Indian wrestling.

Fujinami, the reigning world champion, successfully defended her Asian crown on Wednesday in comfortable fashion. The 19-year-old led 4-0 in the opening minute before closing out the match inside the first round.

Antim had reached the final in style, winning two bouts by VFA (victory by fall) and one by VPO (victory by points), but despite her superb defensive skill, she was no match for the best in the world. Fujinami has now won 114 bouts on the trot (her last loss came in 2017); and has in fact not conceded a single point in senior international competition.

Antim, who became U20 World Champion last year (Fujinami missed the tournament through injury), was competing in only her second major international tournament.

In normal circumstances, India would have been represented in the women's 53kg division by the hugely successful Vinesh Phogat. Instead, Phogat is now in Sonepat training alongside Olympic medalist Bajrang Punia.

Antim had last competed against Vinesh in the qualifiers for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, a bout narrowly won by Vinesh, who went on to win gold in Birmingham. Now, though, Vinesh -- along with Bajrang, Ravi Dahiya and other senior wrestlers - is sitting out the competition in protest against the functioning of the Wrestling Federation of India and its president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

This is a crucial period for the wrestlers, with the Asian Games and World Championships in September this year and the Paris Olympics in July-August 2024. Vinesh may have the pedigree and the most recent trials win but Antim's Asian silver bolsters her claims to a spot on the senior team. She is now the form athlete.

There's no certainty over what will happen prior to the Asiad and the Worlds -- Indian wrestling isn't doing normal in 2023. Vinesh and the other protesting wrestlers are unhappy with the conduct of the investigation and if they continue to be at loggerheads, Antim could take the 53kg spot moving forward using this tournament's performances as the backing.

What then of Vinesh? The future remains murky, while the narrative around the individual careers of the protesting athletes has now become even more compelling.","India's Antim Panghal won silver at the 2023 Asian Wrestling Championships in the 53kg division, after a 10-0 loss to Japanese phenom Akari Fujinami in Astana, Kazakhstan.

They also demanded the WFI President be removed and the entire organisation be disbanded.



With such grave allegations being made against Singh by the wrestlers, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports formed an oversight committee of five members, including MC Mary Kom, to find out what had happened in the case in a month.

Team Udayavani, Apr 13, 2023, 5:55 AM IST

The BJP on Wednesday announced its second list of 23 candidates for the May 10 Assembly polls in Karnataka, denying tickets to seven sitting MLAs, including Madal Virupakshappa who was recently arrested on corruption charges.

The party released its first list of 189 candidates on Tuesday.

The latest list does not include Hubli-Dharwad Central segment, from where former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar wants to contest. It also does not include candidate for the Shivamogga city segment, where sitting MLA and former minister K S Eshwarappa has announced his retirement from electoral politics.

Shettar has been asked by the party’s top brass to make way for youngsters, but he has asserted that he wants to contest one last time.

The list includes four Scheduled Caste, one Scheduled Tribe and two women candidates.

Channagiri MLA Virupakshappa, who was recently arrested by Lokayukta police on corruption charges, was among the incumbent MLAs who were not included in the list. Shiv Kumar has been fielded from the Channagiri seat.

In Haveri, sitting MLA Nehru Olekar was replaced by Gavisiddappa Dyamannavar, while in Byndoor, sitting MLA B Sukumar Shetty made way for Gururaj Gantihole.

Mudigere sitting MLA M P Kumaraswamy was dropped and Deepak Doddaiah was named in his place.

Recently, there was a large-scale protest against HD Kumaraswamy by a section of party workers in the constituency, when veteran leader BS Yediyurappa visited there.

Kalghatgi MLA C M Nimbannavar (76) has been replaced by Nagaraj Chabbi who quit Congress and joined the party recently, and in Mayakonda, Basavaraja Naik has been given the ticket instead of sitting MLA N Linganna.

Davangere North MLA S A Ravindranath (76) was denied renomination. Instead, Lokikere Nagraj got the ticket.

Discontent seems to be brewing within the ruling BJP in Karnataka with the party facing the heat after announcing its first list of candidates on Tuesday after some aspirants who missed the bus expressing displeasure.

The party has so far announced candidates for 212 of the total 224 seats.","Karnataka polls: BJP announces second list of 23 candidates, denies tickets to 7 sitting MLAsA A ATeam Udayavani, Apr 13, 2023, 5:55 AM ISTThe BJP on Wednesday announced its second list of 23 candidates for the May 10 Assembly polls in Karnataka, denying tickets to seven sitting MLAs, including Madal Virupakshappa who was recently arrested on corruption charges.

The medal also pushes into sharp context the major issue around Indian wrestling.

Fujinami, the reigning world champion, successfully defended her Asian crown on Wednesday in comfortable fashion. The 19-year-old led 4-0 in the opening minute before closing out the match inside the first round.

Antim had reached the final in style, winning two bouts by VFA (victory by fall) and one by VPO (victory by points), but despite her superb defensive skill, she was no match for the best in the world. Fujinami has now won 114 bouts on the trot (her last loss came in 2017); and has in fact not conceded a single point in senior international competition.

Antim, who became U20 World Champion last year (Fujinami missed the tournament through injury), was competing in only her second major international tournament.

In normal circumstances, India would have been represented in the women's 53kg division by the hugely successful Vinesh Phogat. Instead, Phogat is now in Sonepat training alongside Olympic medalist Bajrang Punia.

Antim had last competed against Vinesh in the qualifiers for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, a bout narrowly won by Vinesh, who went on to win gold in Birmingham. Now, though, Vinesh -- along with Bajrang, Ravi Dahiya and other senior wrestlers - is sitting out the competition in protest against the functioning of the Wrestling Federation of India and its president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

This is a crucial period for the wrestlers, with the Asian Games and World Championships in September this year and the Paris Olympics in July-August 2024. Vinesh may have the pedigree and the most recent trials win but Antim's Asian silver bolsters her claims to a spot on the senior team. She is now the form athlete.

There's no certainty over what will happen prior to the Asiad and the Worlds -- Indian wrestling isn't doing normal in 2023. Vinesh and the other protesting wrestlers are unhappy with the conduct of the investigation and if they continue to be at loggerheads, Antim could take the 53kg spot moving forward using this tournament's performances as the backing.

What then of Vinesh? The future remains murky, while the narrative around the individual careers of the protesting athletes has now become even more compelling.","India's Antim Panghal won silver at the 2023 Asian Wrestling Championships in the 53kg division, after a 10-0 loss to Japanese phenom Akari Fujinami in Astana, Kazakhstan.

According to recent reports in the media, the allegations of sexual harassment against the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, couldn’t be proven because of a lack of evidence to the contrary. The 6-time MP, currently serving from Kaiserganj, has seen a fair share of controversies even before his three-decade-long political career.





Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, acquitted in over 30 criminal cases including one in the TADA act, was accused of sexual harassment in January earlier this year by a group of wrestlers including Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, and Bajranj Punia, among others, during a protest staged at the Jantar Mantar. They also demanded the WFI President be removed and the entire organisation be disbanded.



With such grave allegations being made against Singh by the wrestlers, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports formed an oversight committee of five members, including MC Mary Kom, to find out what had happened in the case in a month. They later added Babita Phogat to the committee at the behest of the wrestlers and extended the deadline by two weeks. The findings of the sexual harassment case were submitted in early April by the oversight committee but its results are yet to be made public by the Sports Ministry.

A Twitter user shared a photo of her brother drinking a soft drink (Pepsi) after the match between RCB and LSG, purportedly to not celebrate but calm one's sadness with the drink. She called her brother dramebaaz (drama queen) and said, ""RCB lost and he is drinking Pepsi like this."" On April 10, Lucknow Super Giants won the match against Royal Challengers Bangalore with one wicket.

The sister seemed to believe that it was more of a celebration drink. However, the carbonated soft drink brand took note of the image that went viral and replied to it. The company's reply came during a victory day for the IPL franchise as RCB defeated Delhi Capitals on Saturday.

Meanwhile, it was also noted that the boy, in a way became the ambassador for Pepsi at the stadium. Sharing a photo of the boy from the cricket ground, holding a ""Thank You"" placard for the brand, they wrote, ""Rise up baby, life is too short to be sad.""

On a day he shared the stage with his party’s top leadership in the state to present a picture of unity, former Punjab chief minister and Congress leader Charanjit Channi was asked by the Vigilance Bureau to present himself for questioning on Friday, and turned down his request for appearance on April 20 in a disproportionate assets case.

The Vigilance Bureau had earlier asked him to appear before it on Wednesday but Channi had requested postponement till April 20. However, on Thursday afternoon the agency shot off a letter to the Congress leader, directing him to present himself on April 14. The bureau said that since officials were not available on that day, he should turn up for questioning on Friday.

The Congress was quick to term it “harassment”, claiming that, rattled by the presence of Chhani in the campaigning for the May 10 Jalandhar Lok Sabha bypoll, the letter had been issued. “This is sheer attempt at intimidation. The AAP government is rattled by today’s show of strength,” alleged leader of opposition in the assembly Partap Bajwa.

Trying to give a message that there is no infighting and the Congress leadership stands behind its candidate Karamjit Kaur Chaudhary for the by poll, the party put up a united face during the filing of her nomination papers on Thursday.

All leaders, including Channi and Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, ex-state unit chief Navjot Sidhu, party Punjab incharge Harish Chaudhary, present state unit president Amarinder S Raja Warring, Partap Bajwa, MP Gurjit Aujla, state unit working president Bharat Bhushan Ashu, ex-ministers Avtar Henry and Amarjit Samra, and party bypoll incharge Rana Gurjeet Singh came together at Congress Bhawan.

Ex-Jalandhar MP MS Kaypee, who had been sulking over not getting a ticket, also joined them after the candidate and her son and Phillaur MLA Vikramjit Chaudhary visited him last evening.

“We are united and support our candidate Karamjit Chaudhary after the death of her husband and Jalandhar MP Santokh Singh Chaudhary,” said Warring.

The Vigilance Bureau says a detailed dossier has been prepared by a team to question the former chief minister regarding assets owned by him. This would be the first time that Channi will appear before the agency.

Last month, the Vigilance Bureau issued a lookout notice against Channi, fearing that he may attempt to fly out.

Channi was under the Enforcement Directorate’s scanner after his nephew Bhupinder Singh Honey was arrested in connection with an alleged corruption case last year, and approximately Rs 10 crore was seized from his possession. The ED has been scrutinising Channi, his brothers, family members, and some aides for allegedly amassing wealth beyond their declared sources of income. Agencies suspect that the former CM had provided “undue favours” to certain contractors.

According to the ED, Honey had accumulated money by assisting mining contractors and facilitating the transfer and posting of officials.

Wrestlers'...,2023-04-18 17:43:54+05:30,Explained: China's new electromagnetic weapon to quell protests,"After reporting rare large-scale protests – largely peaceful – over stringent COVID-19 curbs last year, China has now come up with a new method to prevent violent demonstrations.

According to reports, the Asian giant has unveiled an electromagnetic gun that fires coin-shaped bullets in order to control riots.

The CS/LW21 gun was revealed in a military technology show broadcasted on the state broadcaster CCTV on 28 March, according to a South China Morning Post (SCMP) report.

What are the features of this electromagnetic gun and why has China introduced it? What do last year’s COVID protests say about the country? We explain.

Features of CS/LW21 gun

Developed by China North Industries Group Corporation Limited and other technology teams, the CS/LW21 gun is designed on the basis of coilgun technology, which uses electromagnets to fire a projectile, according to Bloomberg.

SCMP report says that the gun – with an estimated firing frequency of many thousand rounds per minute – has a sleek design, which makes it easier to handle.

China pioneers portable electromagnetic gun, sets development trend for future weapons

https://t.co/33mmM3dWJX pic.twitter.com/WB5pgyn3in — Zhang Heqing (@zhang_heqing) April 3, 2023

The gun is equipped with a display screen at the front that informs about battery level, frequency, bullet capacity, rail temperature and firing mode, the report added.

It also has a double-chamber magazine for continuous firing and quick reloading.

“The gun is designed like coil guns, which use electric power to accelerate the projectile. When the nine-level coil is electrified, corresponding magnetic fields are formed, which allow the bullet to be sucked out by a relay race method,” the gun’s designer, Lei Fengqiao, was quoted as saying by SCMP.

“It is powered by a built-in lithium-ion battery that can continuously fire hundreds of rounds when fully charged. The charging time is also very short, with little influence from temperature.”

The gun also offers a trajectory with superior control and “multiple point hits”, as per the SCMP report.

The coin-shaped bullets are also advantageous as they are cheaper and easier to store and transport.

The gun emits a low firing sound and does not have flash, smoke, or shells. With its small recoil, the weapon can be used in populated areas, where traditional firearms may trigger panic or more violence, the report added.

‘Non-lethal’ weapon

The weapon has been called “non-lethal” as its round-shaped bullets reduce the risk of killing civilians during riots.

The device is designed in a way to reduce the chances of seriously hurting people while dispersing crowds during violent demonstrations.

These bullets do not penetrate the body, thus lessening the risk of injuries. During field tests, the coin projectiles penetrated double-layered 3mm-thick plywood and damaged cola and beer bottles, reported SCMP.

As per Bloomberg, in electromagnetic weapons, users can select the intensity and frequency of the firing gun.

However, the device can still be used to cause grave injury if the bullets are exchanged with pointed ammunition that can pierce the body.

Protests in China

Widespread protests are not common in China, where the government heavily cracks down on any form of dissent.

So, last November’s large-scale demonstrations against nearly three years of snap lockdowns, with some raising slogans like “Xi Jinping, step down” and “Communist party, step down” were surprising.

A blaze at an apartment block in Urumqi, the capital of the western Xinjiang region, was behind the unusual wave of protests which spread across Beijing, Shanghai and other regions.

Many demonstrators held blank pieces of white paper – a symbol of defiance against the ruling party’s censorship – which led some to describing it as the “A4 Revolution.”

The biggest protests in decades in the country, which saw urban Chinese, students, young people and workers hit the streets, were mostly peaceful. However, some incidents of violence where people clashed with the police were reported.

The protests which eventually petered out had an impact as the government relaxed some lockdown protocols before abruptly scrapping the zero-COVID policy.

As per Time magazine, the government did not resort to repressive measures to quell these protests but adopted other “nuisance measures” such as checking phones and identity papers to discourage people from joining the marches.

The agitation showed that the “state has learned valuable lessons about how most effectively to deter or demobilise protesters without resort to costly (in terms of both resources and reputation) and dangerous repression”, William Hurst, the Chong Hua Professor of Chinese Development at the University of Cambridge, wrote for Time magazine in December 2022.

Notably, NPR reported in January that the police were tacitly rounding up people they believed were behind the demonstrations.

“They have also shown us that grievances have likely not been assuaged and, if anything, deeper issues have taken root in the hearts of many that could lead them to take bigger risks in challenging the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) in the future,” Hurst wrote for Time magazine.

He was contesting in 2004 general elections, and I was covering them, accompanied then by a fellow woman journalist. Both of us were distinctively uncomfortable surrounded by a gangster and his henchmen, and it was a heightened experience that we have never forgotten. There was no doubt we were engaging with a psychopathic violent killer-for-hire.

Thus, the grave discomfort is not over Ahmed being dead, but at what the extra-judicial killing reveals about the nation’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh. The men who pulled the guns and shot the gangster did so in the presence of policemen and media. The shooters are seen in videos and reported in media as shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ as they surrender to the police. In a video interview to the media the distraught mother of one of the three shooters describes her son as a deeply religious, who did darshans, and sang bhajans. In another interview, the father describes his son as a drug addict. The police FIR reportedly says that the three shooters have said during interrogation that they wanted to kill the gangster and his brother “to become popular”.

Presuming the police version is to be believed, and the episode was not a set-up, tough questions about the breakdown of law and order in Uttar Pradesh remain. This execution can be seen as an escalation of due process of law being ignored in the State. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is described as ‘bulldozer baba’ as bulldozers are now used against whomsoever the government sees as ‘trouble-makers’. This is popular with sections of society as some of the targets, whose homes and businesses have been bulldozed, are feared individuals and social oppressors.

Also Read: Appalling state of affairs in Prayagraj

Frequently, bulldozers are also used against the weak and inconvenient, such as protesting members of the minority community. Escalating prejudice against Muslims is now a part of State craft in the BJP bastion. This is the Uttar Pradesh model. The template for governance in the state is a pitched Hindutva on every possible front, enrolment of young men in the ranks of militia-style groups who would be enforcers of the state ideology and incite fear in opponents. This is combined with the doling of free rations very efficiently, necessary to offset the inability of the State to provide jobs or genuine economic growth (given the polarised politics/endemic violence, it’s unlikely any significant industry would move to the interiors).

Since real socio-economic justice cannot be given, there is a need to provide spectacles of instant justice, from bulldozers to now apparently, public murders. Therefore, the state finance minister, Suresh Khanna, said an hour after the assassination that it’s a judgement/decision from the heavens. The heavens are apparently kind to the dons in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). There is, for instance, the party MLC from Mirzapur, Vineet Singh, as tough and nasty as gangsters can be. There is Brajesh Singh of Varanasi, who spent years in jail, but is now out and known to back BJP candidates. (He began his career as a sharpshooter of the Dawood Ibrahim gang of the Mumbai underworld fame, but is currently arguably a desh-bhakt gangster). There is, of course, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, six-term MP (five terms in the BJP) and the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) whom award-winning wrestlers recently accused of sexual harassment. The scandal broke in January and an inquiry was supposed to have been completed in a month, but it’s April now.

Besides many gangsters surviving, radicalised youth and celebration of instant justice make a lethal cocktail. There are fears expressed by ordinary citizens (beyond minorities) who wonder if any dispute or disagreement with those in power can have violent consequences. Should political opponents start worrying that some radicalised youth will come after them ‘to become popular’?

In the short term, however, there is no electoral damage to the BJP. The countdown has begun for the urban local bodies elections that will take place on May 4 and 11 for 760 municipal bodies and mayors will be elected to 17 corporations. There is no real challenge to the BJP comfortably winning these elections. The results will be announced on May 13, the same day the results from the Karnataka assembly elections will be announced.

Indian contingent returned from Astana as the

Hosts Kazakhstan ended the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023 campaign in style as they defeated women’s wrestling powerhouse Japan to top the medal standings. Kazakhstan grabbed seven gold, four silver, and nine bronze medals to finish with the same number of medals as Japan but with more gold.

Japan collected six gold medals, out of which five were in women’s freestyle wrestling. In addition, they earned four silver and 10 bronze medals to bag the second position. Iran were placed third with six gold, three silver, and four bronze at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023.

Kazakhstan bagged the hosting rights of the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023 after the previous host India were stripped of their rights. This was because of a pending investigation on Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh who was the President of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), the organizing body for the Wrestling Sport in India.

Previously, in January, many top wrestlers from India like Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, and Bajrang Punia had alleged harassment and misconduct by the WFI president.

India’s performance at Asian Wrestling Championships 2023

Men’s Greco-Roman (Team Rank – 6th, Points – 115)

Courtesy of Rupin Gahlawat’s silver-medal triumph, India took the sixth spot in the team rankings in the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023. Besides Rupin, the medalists in this event were Neeraj Chhikara, Sunil Kumar, and Vikas Dalal who won their respective bronze medal bouts.

Neeraj and Sunil got the better of their opponents Jinseob Song of South Korea by 5-2 and Masato Sumi by 4-1 (victory by points) to win the bronze medal in the men’s 63kg. Vikas defeated his Chinese rival by 8-0 via superiority.

Women’s Wrestling (Team Rank – 3rd, Points – 143)

In the Women’s freestyle at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023, Antim Panghal (53kg) and Nisha Dahiya (68kg) were the best performers as they both clinched the silver medals in their respective weight classes. The other medalists in this category were Anshu Malik, Sonam Malik, Manisha Bhanwala, Reetika Hooda, and Priya Malik who all won the bronze medal.

India finished as the third-best nation in women’s freestyle wrestling with 143 points, behind Japan (205) and China (149).

Men’s Freestyle (Team Rank – 7th, Points – 99)

Although Aman Sehrawat bagged the gold medal for India in men’s 57kg freestyle, the event recorded India’s worst performance in terms of medals among the three disciplines in this edition. The other medalists in the men’s freestyle were Deepak Mirka in the men’s 79 kg and Anirudh Gulia in the men’s 125kg who collected the bronze.

In the bronze medal match of the men’s 79kg, Deepak got past Shuhrat Bozorov of Tajikistan by 12-1. On the last day of the continental meet when the majority of the Indian wrestlers disappointed, Anirudh emerged as the best wrestler at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023. He did so by defeating Uzbekistan’s Sardorbek Kholmatov via technical superiority by 12-2 to finish India’s campaign with 14 medals.

Asian Wrestling Championships 2023: Wrestlers who impressed most

Aman Sehrawat

The 19-year-old Aman Sehrawat was India’s star wrestler at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023. His gold-medal triumph not only guided India to seventh place overall but also ensured India’s fourth consecutive gold medal in this weight category.

Before Aman, it was Tokyo Olympics silver medalist Ravi Kumar Dahiya who had won three successive golds from 2020 to 2022. However, Ravi had to withdraw his name from the trials owing to an injury which was an opportunity for Aman to represent India and impress everyone.

The U-23 World Champion lived up to the hype and went on to claim the gold medal in the men’s 57kg freestyle to give India its only gold in the continental meeting. To accomplish this feat, he defeated Almaz Smanbekov by 9-4 in the gold-medal match, Wanhao Zou by 7-4 in the semis, and Rikuto Arai in the quarters by 7-1.

Antim Panghal

Antim Panghal has been making waves since becoming the World U-20 champion. At the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023, she once again stunned everyone with her performance by reaching the finals of the continental meet. On her way to the finals, she overcame the challenges of Aktenge Keunimjaeva of Uzbekistan, Li Deng of China, and Singapore’s Alvina Lim.

Although she had to settle for the silver medal as she faced Akari Fujinami, the 2021 World Champion, Antim’s rise in the sport has been nothing short of phenomenal.

Rupin Gahlawat

Rupin Gahlawat gave India a great start by claiming his first international medal in the form of silver on the first day of the championship. In the men’s 55 kg Greco-Roman, the 19-year-old Rupin lost to the reigning U-23 World Champion Pouya Dadmarz and had to settle for a second-place finish. Earlier, Rupin had progressed to the final by winning all his games from the qualification rounds till the final.

Nisha Dahiya

Another Indian who put up a solid show in the continental meet was Nisha Dahiya. Nisha, who was a bronze medalist for India last year, was competing this time in the women’s 65kg. In the semi-final, she upset the Asian Games 2014 gold medalist and two-time Olympian Feng Zhou in the semis by 7-6 to advance to the final. However, Ami Ishi of Japan proved to be the better wrestler in the final and Nisha had to settle for the silver medal.

Asian Wrestling Championships 2023: Wrestlers who disappointed most

Deepak Punia

A lot was expected from the Commonwealth Games 2022 gold medalist Deepak Punia since the Indian side didn’t feature the likes of Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, and Ravi Kumar Dahiya. However, Deepak couldn’t live up to the expectations as he crashed out in the quarter-finals of the competition after losing to Bahrain’s Magomed Sharipov by 0-5 in the men’s 92kg.

This was a huge blow to the Indian contingent as he was considered a serious medal contender at the continental meet.

Sarita Mor

Another experienced campaigner who couldn’t deliver was Sarita Mor. A two-time champion, Sarita failed to reach the semi-final after losing her Round 2 and Round 3 matches against Yui Sakano of Japan and China’s Zhuomalaga. Deepak Punia and Sarita Mor, two of India’s biggest medal hopes, had to return home empty-handed.

Wrestlers'...,2023-04-18 17:43:54+05:30,Explained: China's new electromagnetic weapon to quell protests,"After reporting rare large-scale protests – largely peaceful – over stringent COVID-19 curbs last year, China has now come up with a new method to prevent violent demonstrations.

According to reports, the Asian giant has unveiled an electromagnetic gun that fires coin-shaped bullets in order to control riots.

The CS/LW21 gun was revealed in a military technology show broadcasted on the state broadcaster CCTV on 28 March, according to a South China Morning Post (SCMP) report.

What are the features of this electromagnetic gun and why has China introduced it? What do last year’s COVID protests say about the country? We explain.

Features of CS/LW21 gun

Developed by China North Industries Group Corporation Limited and other technology teams, the CS/LW21 gun is designed on the basis of coilgun technology, which uses electromagnets to fire a projectile, according to Bloomberg.

SCMP report says that the gun – with an estimated firing frequency of many thousand rounds per minute – has a sleek design, which makes it easier to handle.

China pioneers portable electromagnetic gun, sets development trend for future weapons

https://t.co/33mmM3dWJX pic.twitter.com/WB5pgyn3in — Zhang Heqing (@zhang_heqing) April 3, 2023

The gun is equipped with a display screen at the front that informs about battery level, frequency, bullet capacity, rail temperature and firing mode, the report added.

It also has a double-chamber magazine for continuous firing and quick reloading.

“The gun is designed like coil guns, which use electric power to accelerate the projectile. When the nine-level coil is electrified, corresponding magnetic fields are formed, which allow the bullet to be sucked out by a relay race method,” the gun’s designer, Lei Fengqiao, was quoted as saying by SCMP.

“It is powered by a built-in lithium-ion battery that can continuously fire hundreds of rounds when fully charged. The charging time is also very short, with little influence from temperature.”

The gun also offers a trajectory with superior control and “multiple point hits”, as per the SCMP report.

The coin-shaped bullets are also advantageous as they are cheaper and easier to store and transport.

The gun emits a low firing sound and does not have flash, smoke, or shells. With its small recoil, the weapon can be used in populated areas, where traditional firearms may trigger panic or more violence, the report added.

‘Non-lethal’ weapon

The weapon has been called “non-lethal” as its round-shaped bullets reduce the risk of killing civilians during riots.

The device is designed in a way to reduce the chances of seriously hurting people while dispersing crowds during violent demonstrations.

These bullets do not penetrate the body, thus lessening the risk of injuries. During field tests, the coin projectiles penetrated double-layered 3mm-thick plywood and damaged cola and beer bottles, reported SCMP.

As per Bloomberg, in electromagnetic weapons, users can select the intensity and frequency of the firing gun.

However, the device can still be used to cause grave injury if the bullets are exchanged with pointed ammunition that can pierce the body.

Protests in China

Widespread protests are not common in China, where the government heavily cracks down on any form of dissent.

So, last November’s large-scale demonstrations against nearly three years of snap lockdowns, with some raising slogans like “Xi Jinping, step down” and “Communist party, step down” were surprising.

A blaze at an apartment block in Urumqi, the capital of the western Xinjiang region, was behind the unusual wave of protests which spread across Beijing, Shanghai and other regions.

Many demonstrators held blank pieces of white paper – a symbol of defiance against the ruling party’s censorship – which led some to describing it as the “A4 Revolution.”

The biggest protests in decades in the country, which saw urban Chinese, students, young people and workers hit the streets, were mostly peaceful. However, some incidents of violence where people clashed with the police were reported.

The protests which eventually petered out had an impact as the government relaxed some lockdown protocols before abruptly scrapping the zero-COVID policy.

As per Time magazine, the government did not resort to repressive measures to quell these protests but adopted other “nuisance measures” such as checking phones and identity papers to discourage people from joining the marches.

The agitation showed that the “state has learned valuable lessons about how most effectively to deter or demobilise protesters without resort to costly (in terms of both resources and reputation) and dangerous repression”, William Hurst, the Chong Hua Professor of Chinese Development at the University of Cambridge, wrote for Time magazine in December 2022.

Notably, NPR reported in January that the police were tacitly rounding up people they believed were behind the demonstrations.

“They have also shown us that grievances have likely not been assuaged and, if anything, deeper issues have taken root in the hearts of many that could lead them to take bigger risks in challenging the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) in the future,” Hurst wrote for Time magazine.

He was contesting in 2004 general elections, and I was covering them, accompanied then by a fellow woman journalist. Both of us were distinctively uncomfortable surrounded by a gangster and his henchmen, and it was a heightened experience that we have never forgotten. There was no doubt we were engaging with a psychopathic violent killer-for-hire.

Thus, the grave discomfort is not over Ahmed being dead, but at what the extra-judicial killing reveals about the nation’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh. The men who pulled the guns and shot the gangster did so in the presence of policemen and media. The shooters are seen in videos and reported in media as shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ as they surrender to the police. In a video interview to the media the distraught mother of one of the three shooters describes her son as a deeply religious, who did darshans, and sang bhajans. In another interview, the father describes his son as a drug addict. The police FIR reportedly says that the three shooters have said during interrogation that they wanted to kill the gangster and his brother “to become popular”.

Presuming the police version is to be believed, and the episode was not a set-up, tough questions about the breakdown of law and order in Uttar Pradesh remain. This execution can be seen as an escalation of due process of law being ignored in the State. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is described as ‘bulldozer baba’ as bulldozers are now used against whomsoever the government sees as ‘trouble-makers’. This is popular with sections of society as some of the targets, whose homes and businesses have been bulldozed, are feared individuals and social oppressors.

Also Read: Appalling state of affairs in Prayagraj

Frequently, bulldozers are also used against the weak and inconvenient, such as protesting members of the minority community. Escalating prejudice against Muslims is now a part of State craft in the BJP bastion. This is the Uttar Pradesh model. The template for governance in the state is a pitched Hindutva on every possible front, enrolment of young men in the ranks of militia-style groups who would be enforcers of the state ideology and incite fear in opponents. This is combined with the doling of free rations very efficiently, necessary to offset the inability of the State to provide jobs or genuine economic growth (given the polarised politics/endemic violence, it’s unlikely any significant industry would move to the interiors).

Since real socio-economic justice cannot be given, there is a need to provide spectacles of instant justice, from bulldozers to now apparently, public murders. Therefore, the state finance minister, Suresh Khanna, said an hour after the assassination that it’s a judgement/decision from the heavens. The heavens are apparently kind to the dons in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). There is, for instance, the party MLC from Mirzapur, Vineet Singh, as tough and nasty as gangsters can be. There is Brajesh Singh of Varanasi, who spent years in jail, but is now out and known to back BJP candidates. (He began his career as a sharpshooter of the Dawood Ibrahim gang of the Mumbai underworld fame, but is currently arguably a desh-bhakt gangster). There is, of course, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, six-term MP (five terms in the BJP) and the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) whom award-winning wrestlers recently accused of sexual harassment. The scandal broke in January and an inquiry was supposed to have been completed in a month, but it’s April now.

Besides many gangsters surviving, radicalised youth and celebration of instant justice make a lethal cocktail. There are fears expressed by ordinary citizens (beyond minorities) who wonder if any dispute or disagreement with those in power can have violent consequences. Should political opponents start worrying that some radicalised youth will come after them ‘to become popular’?

In the short term, however, there is no electoral damage to the BJP. The countdown has begun for the urban local bodies elections that will take place on May 4 and 11 for 760 municipal bodies and mayors will be elected to 17 corporations. There is no real challenge to the BJP comfortably winning these elections. The results will be announced on May 13, the same day the results from the Karnataka assembly elections will be announced.

Indian contingent returned from Astana as the

Hosts Kazakhstan ended the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023 campaign in style as they defeated women’s wrestling powerhouse Japan to top the medal standings. Kazakhstan grabbed seven gold, four silver, and nine bronze medals to finish with the same number of medals as Japan but with more gold.

Japan collected six gold medals, out of which five were in women’s freestyle wrestling. In addition, they earned four silver and 10 bronze medals to bag the second position. Iran were placed third with six gold, three silver, and four bronze at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023.

Kazakhstan bagged the hosting rights of the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023 after the previous host India were stripped of their rights. This was because of a pending investigation on Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh who was the President of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), the organizing body for the Wrestling Sport in India.

Previously, in January, many top wrestlers from India like Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, and Bajrang Punia had alleged harassment and misconduct by the WFI president.

Indian Sports Live Coverage on Khel Now

India’s performance at Asian Wrestling Championships 2023

Men’s Greco-Roman (Team Rank – 6th, Points – 115)

Courtesy of Rupin Gahlawat’s silver-medal triumph, India took the sixth spot in the team rankings in the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023. Besides Rupin, the medalists in this event were Neeraj Chhikara, Sunil Kumar, and Vikas Dalal who won their respective bronze medal bouts.

Neeraj and Sunil got the better of their opponents Jinseob Song of South Korea by 5-2 and Masato Sumi by 4-1 (victory by points) to win the bronze medal in the men’s 63kg. Vikas defeated his Chinese rival by 8-0 via superiority.

Women’s Wrestling (Team Rank – 3rd, Points – 143)

In the Women’s freestyle at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023, Antim Panghal (53kg) and Nisha Dahiya (68kg) were the best performers as they both clinched the silver medals in their respective weight classes. The other medalists in this category were Anshu Malik, Sonam Malik, Manisha Bhanwala, Reetika Hooda, and Priya Malik who all won the bronze medal.

India finished as the third-best nation in women’s freestyle wrestling with 143 points, behind Japan (205) and China (149).

Men’s Freestyle (Team Rank – 7th, Points – 99)

Although Aman Sehrawat bagged the gold medal for India in men’s 57kg freestyle, the event recorded India’s worst performance in terms of medals among the three disciplines in this edition. The other medalists in the men’s freestyle were Deepak Mirka in the men’s 79 kg and Anirudh Gulia in the men’s 125kg who collected the bronze.

In the bronze medal match of the men’s 79kg, Deepak got past Shuhrat Bozorov of Tajikistan by 12-1. On the last day of the continental meet when the majority of the Indian wrestlers disappointed, Anirudh emerged as the best wrestler at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023. He did so by defeating Uzbekistan’s Sardorbek Kholmatov via technical superiority by 12-2 to finish India’s campaign with 14 medals.

Asian Wrestling Championships 2023: Wrestlers who impressed most

Aman Sehrawat

The 19-year-old Aman Sehrawat was India’s star wrestler at the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023. His gold-medal triumph not only guided India to seventh place overall but also ensured India’s fourth consecutive gold medal in this weight category.

Before Aman, it was Tokyo Olympics silver medalist Ravi Kumar Dahiya who had won three successive golds from 2020 to 2022. However, Ravi had to withdraw his name from the trials owing to an injury which was an opportunity for Aman to represent India and impress everyone.

The U-23 World Champion lived up to the hype and went on to claim the gold medal in the men’s 57kg freestyle to give India its only gold in the continental meeting. To accomplish this feat, he defeated Almaz Smanbekov by 9-4 in the gold-medal match, Wanhao Zou by 7-4 in the semis, and Rikuto Arai in the quarters by 7-1.

Antim Panghal

Antim Panghal has been making waves since becoming the World U-20 champion. At the Asian Wrestling Championships 2023, she once again stunned everyone with her performance by reaching the finals of the continental meet. On her way to the finals, she overcame the challenges of Aktenge Keunimjaeva of Uzbekistan, Li Deng of China, and Singapore’s Alvina Lim.

Although she had to settle for the silver medal as she faced Akari Fujinami, the 2021 World Champion, Antim’s rise in the sport has been nothing short of phenomenal.

Rupin Gahlawat

Rupin Gahlawat gave India a great start by claiming his first international medal in the form of silver on the first day of the championship. In the men’s 55 kg Greco-Roman, the 19-year-old Rupin lost to the reigning U-23 World Champion Pouya Dadmarz and had to settle for a second-place finish. Earlier, Rupin had progressed to the final by winning all his games from the qualification rounds till the final.

Nisha Dahiya

Another Indian who put up a solid show in the continental meet was Nisha Dahiya. Nisha, who was a bronze medalist for India last year, was competing this time in the women’s 65kg. In the semi-final, she upset the Asian Games 2014 gold medalist and two-time Olympian Feng Zhou in the semis by 7-6 to advance to the final. However, Ami Ishi of Japan proved to be the better wrestler in the final and Nisha had to settle for the silver medal.

Asian Wrestling Championships 2023: Wrestlers who disappointed most

Deepak Punia

A lot was expected from the Commonwealth Games 2022 gold medalist Deepak Punia since the Indian side didn’t feature the likes of Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, and Ravi Kumar Dahiya. However, Deepak couldn’t live up to the expectations as he crashed out in the quarter-finals of the competition after losing to Bahrain’s Magomed Sharipov by 0-5 in the men’s 92kg.

This was a huge blow to the Indian contingent as he was considered a serious medal contender at the continental meet.

Sarita Mor

Another experienced campaigner who couldn’t deliver was Sarita Mor. A two-time champion, Sarita failed to reach the semi-final after losing her Round 2 and Round 3 matches against Yui Sakano of Japan and China’s Zhuomalaga. Deepak Punia and Sarita Mor, two of India’s biggest medal hopes, had to return home empty-handed.

Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivas Murthy

Bengaluru: Congress MLA from Pulikeshi Nagar Akhanda Srinivas Murthy is expected to resign as legislator since the party is yet to announce its candidate from the constituency.

The leaders of minority communities here have accused Akhanda Srinivas Murthy of causing the riots in DJ Halli and KG Halli in 2020, with his discriminatory attitude. It is also reported that the leaders urged the Congress High Command not to give ticket to Shrinivasa Murthy for the Assembly elections in May.

The Congress leaders are apparently yet to confirm on the party candidate from the constituency, following said developments in Pulikeshi Nagar in relation to the violence in 2020.

There are also rumours of Srinivas Murthy desiring to resign from his post, upset by the continued uncertainty on who the party would field from the constituency this year.

So does that mean that he will not be involved with WFI anymore?

""I have said I will not contest for president's post, I have not said I will not contest elections."" Brij Bhushan, 66, will have to serve a four-year cooling off period to regain the eligibility to contest for an office bearer's post.

However, he can be part of the five-member WFI Executive Committee.

By the time he serves the cooling-off period in 2027, he would have attained the age of 70 and that will again make him ineligible to contest according to the Code, that has placed the age cap on all officials.

It will be interesting to see if his son Karan, who is the president of U.P. Wrestling Association, throws his hat into the ring. Asked if he was allowed to attend the AGM in the wake of sexual harassment and intimidation accusations levelled against him by the top wrestlers of the country, the WFI President said, he has worked within the rules.

""In writing, I was asked to step aside for three weeks, and later it was extended to six weeks, and I did that. I have appeared at IOA and oversight panel hearings. I can work as WFI official now. There is no question of flouting any rule. ""The findings of the committee are with the government, and I am waiting for that report.""

The country's top wrestlers including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, and Sarita Mor along with several others, alleged that the WFI chief has sexually harassed female wrestlers and also intimidates the athletes.

Brij Bhushan said it was laughable what the wrestlers said during the hearings.

""I could not stop laughing what these wrestlers were saying. If I had anything inappropriate with Sakshi Malik then why did she invite me to her wedding. They come to me with their personal matters and also family issues. They sit with my son and daughter-in-law and have food together and now suddenly they are alleging that I have harassed them. If that's the case why do they come to my home?""

The WFI boss said the federation will not have revenge in mind when the issue is sorted.

""There are a lot of people, who can't face me now, not just these protesting wrestlers. But if they want to play, the process remains the same for everyone. All eligible candidates can compete but WFI is not going to exempt any wrestler from Olympic trials even if a wrestler wins quota in a specific category. If Bajrang books Olympic quota, he will have to beat the winner of the national trials to compete in Olympics. if he loses, he will still be a given a chance after 15 days for a re-match and earn a place in the Indian team.

""There will be no discrimination. I have not done anything wrong. These wrestlers were just a pawn, someone else is behind this controversy. The wrestlers have been used for this. I have not spent one day in any sort of guilt, I have kept doing my work and the federation will continue to do that whether I remain part of it or not.""","Brij Bhushan has served three four-year terms as president in a row and according to the Sports Code after completing 12 years as WFI chief, he is ineligible to contest for the top post.

Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivas Murthy

Bengaluru: Congress MLA from Pulikeshi Nagar Akhanda Srinivas Murthy is expected to resign as legislator since the party is yet to announce its candidate from the constituency.

The leaders of minority communities here have accused Akhanda Srinivas Murthy of causing the riots in DJ Halli and KG Halli in 2020, with his discriminatory attitude. It is also reported that the leaders urged the Congress High Command not to give ticket to Shrinivasa Murthy for the Assembly elections in May.

The Congress leaders are apparently yet to confirm on the party candidate from the constituency, following said developments in Pulikeshi Nagar in relation to the violence in 2020.

There are also rumours of Srinivas Murthy desiring to resign from his post, upset by the continued uncertainty on who the party would field from the constituency this year.

Mumbai: After scanning footage from 150 CCTV cameras, the Vasai Road railway police succeeded in catching a 30-year-old history-sheeter who is allegedly involved in several chain-snatching cases. Six gold chains worth Rs4.16 lakh were recovered from his possession. The suspect was identified as Mohammad Aman Hussain, a Nalasopara resident.

The rising menace of chain-snatching in Vasai, Mira Road and Nalasopara prompted the police to launch a probe. The investigation began last week, however, it was proving difficult to identify the suspect as he was seen wearing a mask and cap in every footage.

Cops tracked accused based on hunch

The police noticed that the man, who was first spotted in the footage captured at the Vasai railway station, deliberately avoided cameras. Based on a hunch, cops started tracking the suspect with the help of CCTVs. Even after scanning visuals from more than 100 cameras mounted around Vasai and Nalasopara, they were unable to identify the suspect as he never dropped his guard and continued to cover his face.

Finally, the awaited moment arrived when the man uncovered his face, after which the police sent his visuals to their sources to identify him. A tip-off was received that he would be coming to Nalasopara. Accordingly, a trap was laid and Aman was apprehended.

He has confessed to four chain-snatching cases registered at police stations in Vasai, Nalasopara and Mira Road. A case has been registered against him under the Indian Penal Code section 392 (robbery).","© Provided by Free Press Journal Mumbai: Chain-snatcher nabbed after screening over 150 CCTV cameras; ₹4 lakh booty recoveredMumbai: After scanning footage from 150 CCTV cameras, the Vasai Road railway police succeeded in catching a 30-year-old history-sheeter who is allegedly involved in several chain-snatching cases.

The 25-year-old Sydneysider parted ways amicably with Fenech although they reportedly fell out over his fighting weight, with the 21-1(19KO’s) fighter looking to move up.

Jarvis was seen as a genuine world title contender at super featherweight in 2021 but moved up to super lightweight in October last year to fight fellow Aussie Liam Paro, copping a first round knockout.

But now Jarvis wants to move up in weight again and will fight﻿ at either super welterweight or middleweight, which could be a jump of 9kg, a massive risk for a fighter who has been rocked by fighters at a lower weight in his last two fights.

That’s what sparked Fenech’s opposition to the move, however, Jarvis is said to be done with stripping down in weight, citing a notable impact on his power in the ring.﻿

“Right throughout my career, I’ve always cut a lot of weight,” he told Fox Sports.

“And middleweight, junior middleweight, I feel I can campaign there for some time.”

Jarvis will travel to Las Vegas on his own and spar at a few gyms in a bid to find the right fit for him moving forward.

Wide World of Sports contacted Fenech for comment and he acknowledged the split.

The situation also hits Fenech on a personal level with Jarvis, with the 25-year-old ending his relationship with Fenech’s daughter Kayla a few months back.

Dhoni had warned them post the match and asserted that if they don’t cut on the extras they will have to “play under a new captain.”

“They’ll have to bowl no no-balls and fewer wides. We are bowling too many extra deliveries and need to cut them out otherwise they’ll be playing under a new captain,” Dhoni had said. In the following match against Mumbai Indians (MI) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) eight and ten extras were conceded.

“Dhoni was not looking happy because he has mentioned it before that he wants the bowlers to reduce the number of no-balls and wides. CSK had bowled two-three overs of extra and against RCB, they bowled another extra over.

“It shouldn’t go to a stage where Dhoni gets banned and CSK has to take the field without their captain,” Sehwag told Cricbuzz.

With the kind of knee injury he has, it appears he might play only a handful of matches more anyway. He is constantly pushing himself but if his bowlers are bowling so many wides and no-balls, then Dhoni will have to take rest,” he added.

Terming CSK’s bowling attack ‘weak’, the former India opener said if CSK will have to work on the bowlers they have in the squad.

“I’m saying from day 1 that CSK’s bowling is weak. They need to work on that department. But what more can they do? They will have to use whatever resources they have this season. The bowlers have to be more accurate.

If look at their performance against RCB, they have bowled 30-35 dot balls so they didn’t let RCB score a run in six overs. Despite that, they ended up conceding 218 because they leaked far too many sixes and fours,” he said.

Mumbai, Apr 16 (PTI) The rivalry between two players in the Indian domestic circuit came to the fore at the IPL stage here on Sunday, with Kolkata Knight Riders' captain Nitish Rana and Mumbai Indians' Hrithik Shokeen engaging in a war of words in the first innings.

The incident happened in the ninth over of their match at the Wankhede Stadium when the Mumbai Indians' bowler gave an earful to Rana after dismissing the KKR captain, who stopped in his tracks to turn around and hurl some words back at the bowler.

Shokeen had Rana caught at long on by substitute fielder Ramandeep Singh, and immediately looked in the direction of the batter to say a few words. But as Rana turned back to respond to the young player's charge at him, Mumbai Indians' stand-in skipper Suryakumar Yadav and the senior most player in the game, Piyush Chawla, stepped in to diffuse the tension.

Do you wish you could go back to the start of the weekend? Well, sadly, we can’t help with that, but we can help to create some feelings of nostalgia. Check out Andrey Rublev and Grigor Dimitrov square off with some old-fashioned tennis rackets.

The tennis world has come a long way, and we have seen numerous changes made to certain aspects of the game- like the tennis racket. Tennis rackets are crucial to the game, and making sure that you have the right one is essential to your overall game.

Let’s look at some changes that have been made over the years to increase the efficiency of the racket. The head sizes have increased in size, with most models today being measured at 100 square inches. The size of the beam/neck of the racket has also been raised, measuring between 23-26mm. Newer rackets are also a lot stiffer and have more open string patterns; they are also a lot lighter than their ancestral counterparts.

Rublev plays with a customized version of the Head Gravity Pro and, like many pros, has added weight to the frame. This has allowed him to gain more power and stability; not only that but adding weight to one’s racket also helps with transmitting less shock than a lighter racket. However, this does lower the rate at which a player can swing their racket, and it also reduces the amount of topspin they can put on the ball.

Dimitrov plays with a standard Wilson Pro Staff 97S. The racket offers many benefits to the Bulgarian star, like his power and ability to spin the ball. However, it does offer a downside, as it is considered to have a hefty swing.

We can see in the video the importance of having the right racket as we see Rublev and Dimitrov struggle to match their usual strike speed. The pair brought us an enjoyable moment, and we can see they also enjoyed it.

The stars played a quick rally that had some funny comments.

“Oh, wow.” said Dimitrov after playing a backhand shot that didn’t work out how he is used to.

The Bulgarian star delivered an excellent backhand shot that found itself sailing parallel to the line, and past Rublev’s racket, to finish off the rally. We can see that he certainly enjoyed playing that shot as he softly punches the air and says, “Yes! Sorry!”

Rublev will certainly not forget his racket when he faces Holger Rune in the Monte Carlo Masters final later today.

The state is scheduled to go to polls towards the end of next year.

""Congress is fully prepared and we will register a resounding win...People of Haryana are eagerly waiting for the elections and have made up their mind to vote out the BJP-JJP alliance and form the Congress government,"" Hooda said.

Speaking on the ongoing protest of the country's top wrestlers in Delhi, the Congress leader said an impartial inquiry into the matter is necessary.

“It is an unfortunate situation if the sportspersons, who have brought glory to the entire country all over the world, have to protest like this,"" he said.

Country's top wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, returned to protest site Jantar Mantar on Sunday and demanded that the government makes public the findings of the oversight panel that investigated into sexual harassment allegations against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Hitting out at the BJP-led government in Haryana, Hooda, who is also Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the state, said the claims made by the government for payment within 72 hours after crop procurement, Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers and compensation for damages are nowhere visible on the ground.

“From Sonipat, Panipat, Karnal to Kurukshetra, I have myself talked to the farmers by going to many mandis. Mustard farmers had to sell their crop at Rs 500-1000 per quintal below MSP.

“Like mustard, wheat farmers are also facing problems. Earlier, the farmers were facing problems because the government portal was not running, now they are being hit by the imposition of value cut, lustre loss and non-uptake. The arrival of wheat in the mandis is in full swing but the process of lifting the grain is going on at a snail's pace,” he claimed.

The claim of payment within 72 hours by the government is proving to be completely baseless. The lifting is not happening because the government did not give the tenders for transport in time,” he added.

He said Haryana, which was ahead in several fields during the previous Congress regime, is today ""number one in terms of unemployment, crime, drug menace and corruption"".

If we talk about Hisar itself, several development works, including setting up of a power plant and building a university, took place in the area during the Congress tenure, he claimed.

But no such work of development was done during the past eight years of tenure of the BJP-led government, he claimed.

""Not only Hisar, this is the condition of the entire Haryana. In the last eight-and-a-half years, no power plant was built in the state, no medical college, no big university, Metro rail was not extended, no new railway line was built, no big project or big industry was established in Haryana,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: After government's no action into sexual harassment allegations against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh the top wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat , made a return to protest site at Jantar Mantar after three months on Sunday.The wrestlers also demanded that the government make public the findings of the oversight panel that probed the charges against Brij Bhushan.The government had formed a six-member oversight panel, headed by legendary boxer MS Mary Kom to investigate the allegations against WFI boss levelled by the wrestlers.The panel submitted its report in the first week of April but the government has not yet made it public.The wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya, had in January raised the issue, but ended their three-day long sit-in after marathon talks with Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.""How long is it going to take for the (government) committee to submit its report. It's already been three months and we are still waiting to hear from them. Will the report come out after the girls, who have filed complaints, die?,"" questioned Vinesh, the world championship medallist.""We are tired of asking the government to release the findings. We have filed a complaint at a police station in Connaught Place and want an FIR to be filed against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.""We have nothing to do with the (WFI) election process.

The (Paris) Olympics are upon us and we want to begin preparations in right earnest,"" she added.""You people can see who is running the federation despite such serious charges. We only have the power of truth which I suppose is not sufficient,"" she said, adding, ""The least the government can do is to take action on the sexual harassment that has been done. We demand justice. We will continue out protest.""During the three-month period since the country's top wrestlers made the allegations, Singh has appeared before the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and the government's oversight panel.However, multiple sources have confirmed that the wrestlers couldn't prove the sexual harassment charges against the WFI chief.""We will not budge from Jantar Mantar,"" said Rio Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik, adding ""this fight will not stop"".""The girls have appeared before the committee, but the report hasn't come. The federation is running as before, organising nationals in their region. So what has changed?Bajrang said it was his moral duty to stand up with the protesting women wrestlers.""Agar hum inke saath nahin khare honge toh aur kaun khara hoga (If we don't stand up with them them who will?),"" the Tokyo Games bronze medallist said.""Even if I have to lay down my life for their cause, I am willing to go to that extent,"" he added.The Delhi Commission For Women (DCW) on Sunday said it has received a complaint from the women wrestlers alleging that they had given a written complaint to the city police two days back, but no FIR had not been registered till now.The complainant informed the Commission that several women wrestlers, including a minor, had alleged that Singh sexually harassed them during his tenure at the WFI.She also said that a complaint was filed at the Connaught Place police station on April 21.She claimed that no action has been taken by the Station House Officer (SHO), Connaught Place police station on the complaint. She also said that when she called the SHO to enquire about the status of the complaint on April 22, she was informed by him that no FIR had been filed and that action shall be taken on the complaint post Monday.The complainant also alleged that when she asked him for assurance that the FIR shall be filed by Monday, he answered that he could not guarantee it, according to the DCW.A senior police officer said they have received seven complaints so far. He said some of the complaints pertain to Delhi and some from outside the city.""We are conducting an inquiry. No FIR has been registered yet,"" he said.The Delhi Commission For Women (DCW) also noted that they have been informed that some of the complainants and their family members had started getting phone calls from an IPS officer posted in the Department of Sports, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS) enquiring about the identities of the complainants.Meanwhile, the panel has issued notice to the Delhi Police in the matter and sought an action taken report by April 25. The Commission has sought a copy of the FIR and asked the police to explain the reasons for delay in registration of FIR.The panel also sought details of security provided to the complainants along with details of the persons who allegedly shared the information regarding the matter with officials from the Department of Sports.Expressing solidarity with the protesters, Sharad Pawar's NCP said Union ministers Anurag Thakur and Smriti Irani should step in to address the concerns raised by the top wrestlers.""(Youth Affairs And Sports Minister) Anurag Thakur and Smriti Irani must intervene immediately and ask the Delhi Police, which works under the Union home ministry, to take immediate action.

The country’s top wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, returned to the protest site at Jantar Mantar on Sunday and demanded that the government makes public the findings of the oversight panel that investigated sexual harassment allegations against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

The wrestlers also demanded that an FIR be lodged against the WFI chief, who has denied the allegations that first surfaced in January this year when grapplers had staged a ‘sit-in’ protest and demanded that federation be disbanded.

The six-member oversight panel, headed by M.C. Mary Kom, had submitted its report in the first week of April but the government has not yet made it public.

“We are tired of asking the government to release the findings. We have filed a complaint at a police station in Connaught Place and want an FIR to be filed against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh,” said Vinesh.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal issued a notice to the Delhi police asking as to why an FIR had not been registered following the complaint submitted on April 21.

In a letter to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Pranav Tayal, Ms. Maliwal said that the women’s body has received a complaint from one of the women wrestlers who have sought an FIR against Mr. Singh.

“She (the complainant) has informed the Commission that instead of an FIR being filed in the matter, some of the complainants and their family members have started getting phone calls enquiring about the identities of the complainants from an IPS officer posted in Department of Sports, MYAS (Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports),” Ms. Maliwal wrote.

Terming is a serious matter concerning the safety of female wrestlers, the DCW chief asked the DCP to submit by Tuesday 4 p.m. a copy of FIR in the matter, reasons for delay, details of accused persons arrested in the matter, details of action taken against the official who leaked the complainant’s information with the officials at the Department of Sports, MYAS, among other details.

The women’s body also sought a detailed action taken report in the whole matter by Tuesday.

When contacted, there was no response form the Delhi Police on the matter.

Accusing Brij Bhushan of sexually harassing seven women wrestlers, which also includes a minor, the wrestlers said that they gave a complaint at Connaught Place Police Station two days back against the WFI chief but the police is yet to file an FIR.

Addressing a press conference, Sakshi Malik has said, ""We made a complaint at CP Police Station. It has been two days, but no FIR has been registered yet. Seven women complained, which also includes a minor. It makes for a POSCO case, but nothing has been done yet.""

Earlier in the day, Vinesh tweeted: ""Various female wrestlers who have brought laurels to this country have been sexually exploited and harassed by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, President, WFI. The Delhi Police is not registering the FIR despite complaints on 21.04.2023.""

This development comes three months after they first sat down in protest at Jantar Mantar (on January 18). There they had levelled various allegations against Singh and the federation, including sexual exploitation, mental harassment, death threats, and financial misappropriation.

Following that the Sports Ministry had intervened and constituted an investigation committee to both investigate the complaints of the wrestlers and take over the day-to-day functioning of the WFI. At the time the wrestlers had made known their disappointment that the government did not consult them before forming the oversight committee. The deadline for the committee to submit their report had initially been four weeks but had since been extended.

""It's been three months and we haven't got justice. That's why we are here again, to demand justice. We will sleep, eat here until we get justice,"" Vinesh said on Sunday.

""The committee should tell us what their decision is. It hasn't happened yet. At least, we should know if we were wrong, or who was wrong,"" Sakshi demanded. She added, ""We keep hearing that we're finished and that's the reason we are protesting. Are we really finished? We won medals at the latest Commonwealth Games. All we are hearing is that we are protesting because our wrestling careers are over. Why would we do this? We want to save wrestling. We are protesting to take wrestling away from those hands. We hope that truth will win.""

""The federation is organising nationals, they're running day-to-day affairs, their office is open, so where are they listening to us? So were we sitting here for nothing? If an FIR is registered, you'll know if we were lying or not. First you were saying we weren't filing a case, now when seven women have filed a complaint, they're not registering an FIR. We will not move from here unless he's arrested,"" Bajrang said.

Vinesh, speaking to ESPN two weeks ago, had said that she would be continuing the fight. ""What else can I do? Where else can I go? What will they do? Harm us?... There are so many people giving up their lives for the nation. Even our sacrifice will be remembered as the athletes who took a stand to save sports in the country. Who knows, this may bring about a positive change in sports. If sports improve because of an athlete, then is there a bigger medal than this? Winning this battle would be no less than a medal.""","Addressing a press conference, Sakshi Malik has said, ""We made a complaint at CP Police Station.

The state is scheduled to go to polls towards the end of next year.

""Congress is fully prepared and we will register a resounding win...People of Haryana are eagerly waiting for the elections and have made up their mind to vote out the BJP-JJP alliance and form the Congress government,"" Hooda said.

Speaking on the ongoing protest of the country's top wrestlers in Delhi, the Congress leader said an impartial inquiry into the matter is necessary.

“It is an unfortunate situation if the sportspersons, who have brought glory to the entire country all over the world, have to protest like this,"" he said.

Country's top wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, returned to protest site Jantar Mantar on Sunday and demanded that the government makes public the findings of the oversight panel that investigated into sexual harassment allegations against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Hitting out at the BJP-led government in Haryana, Hooda, who is also Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the state, said the claims made by the government for payment within 72 hours after crop procurement, Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers and compensation for damages are nowhere visible on the ground.

“From Sonipat, Panipat, Karnal to Kurukshetra, I have myself talked to the farmers by going to many mandis. Mustard farmers had to sell their crop at Rs 500-1000 per quintal below MSP.

“Like mustard, wheat farmers are also facing problems. Earlier, the farmers were facing problems because the government portal was not running, now they are being hit by the imposition of value cut, lustre loss and non-uptake. The arrival of wheat in the mandis is in full swing but the process of lifting the grain is going on at a snail's pace,” he claimed.

The claim of payment within 72 hours by the government is proving to be completely baseless. The lifting is not happening because the government did not give the tenders for transport in time,” he added.

He said Haryana, which was ahead in several fields during the previous Congress regime, is today ""number one in terms of unemployment, crime, drug menace and corruption"".

If we talk about Hisar itself, several development works, including setting up of a power plant and building a university, took place in the area during the Congress tenure, he claimed.

But no such work of development was done during the past eight years of tenure of the BJP-led government, he claimed.

""Not only Hisar, this is the condition of the entire Haryana. In the last eight-and-a-half years, no power plant was built in the state, no medical college, no big university, Metro rail was not extended, no new railway line was built, no big project or big industry was established in Haryana,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: After government's no action into sexual harassment allegations against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh the top wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat , made a return to protest site at Jantar Mantar after three months on Sunday.The wrestlers also demanded that the government make public the findings of the oversight panel that probed the charges against Brij Bhushan.The government had formed a six-member oversight panel, headed by legendary boxer MS Mary Kom to investigate the allegations against WFI boss levelled by the wrestlers.The panel submitted its report in the first week of April but the government has not yet made it public.The wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya, had in January raised the issue, but ended their three-day long sit-in after marathon talks with Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.""How long is it going to take for the (government) committee to submit its report. It's already been three months and we are still waiting to hear from them. Will the report come out after the girls, who have filed complaints, die?,"" questioned Vinesh, the world championship medallist.""We are tired of asking the government to release the findings. We have filed a complaint at a police station in Connaught Place and want an FIR to be filed against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.""We have nothing to do with the (WFI) election process.

The (Paris) Olympics are upon us and we want to begin preparations in right earnest,"" she added.""You people can see who is running the federation despite such serious charges. We only have the power of truth which I suppose is not sufficient,"" she said, adding, ""The least the government can do is to take action on the sexual harassment that has been done. We demand justice. We will continue out protest.""During the three-month period since the country's top wrestlers made the allegations, Singh has appeared before the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and the government's oversight panel.However, multiple sources have confirmed that the wrestlers couldn't prove the sexual harassment charges against the WFI chief.""We will not budge from Jantar Mantar,"" said Rio Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik, adding ""this fight will not stop"".""The girls have appeared before the committee, but the report hasn't come. The federation is running as before, organising nationals in their region. So what has changed?Bajrang said it was his moral duty to stand up with the protesting women wrestlers.""Agar hum inke saath nahin khare honge toh aur kaun khara hoga (If we don't stand up with them them who will?),"" the Tokyo Games bronze medallist said.""Even if I have to lay down my life for their cause, I am willing to go to that extent,"" he added.The Delhi Commission For Women (DCW) on Sunday said it has received a complaint from the women wrestlers alleging that they had given a written complaint to the city police two days back, but no FIR had not been registered till now.The complainant informed the Commission that several women wrestlers, including a minor, had alleged that Singh sexually harassed them during his tenure at the WFI.She also said that a complaint was filed at the Connaught Place police station on April 21.She claimed that no action has been taken by the Station House Officer (SHO), Connaught Place police station on the complaint. She also said that when she called the SHO to enquire about the status of the complaint on April 22, she was informed by him that no FIR had been filed and that action shall be taken on the complaint post Monday.The complainant also alleged that when she asked him for assurance that the FIR shall be filed by Monday, he answered that he could not guarantee it, according to the DCW.A senior police officer said they have received seven complaints so far. He said some of the complaints pertain to Delhi and some from outside the city.""We are conducting an inquiry. No FIR has been registered yet,"" he said.The Delhi Commission For Women (DCW) also noted that they have been informed that some of the complainants and their family members had started getting phone calls from an IPS officer posted in the Department of Sports, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS) enquiring about the identities of the complainants.Meanwhile, the panel has issued notice to the Delhi Police in the matter and sought an action taken report by April 25. The Commission has sought a copy of the FIR and asked the police to explain the reasons for delay in registration of FIR.The panel also sought details of security provided to the complainants along with details of the persons who allegedly shared the information regarding the matter with officials from the Department of Sports.Expressing solidarity with the protesters, Sharad Pawar's NCP said Union ministers Anurag Thakur and Smriti Irani should step in to address the concerns raised by the top wrestlers.""(Youth Affairs And Sports Minister) Anurag Thakur and Smriti Irani must intervene immediately and ask the Delhi Police, which works under the Union home ministry, to take immediate action.

The country’s top wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, returned to the protest site at Jantar Mantar on Sunday and demanded that the government makes public the findings of the oversight panel that investigated sexual harassment allegations against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

The wrestlers also demanded that an FIR be lodged against the WFI chief, who has denied the allegations that first surfaced in January this year when grapplers had staged a ‘sit-in’ protest and demanded that federation be disbanded.

The six-member oversight panel, headed by M.C. Mary Kom, had submitted its report in the first week of April but the government has not yet made it public.

“We are tired of asking the government to release the findings. We have filed a complaint at a police station in Connaught Place and want an FIR to be filed against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh,” said Vinesh.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal issued a notice to the Delhi police asking as to why an FIR had not been registered following the complaint submitted on April 21.

In a letter to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Pranav Tayal, Ms. Maliwal said that the women’s body has received a complaint from one of the women wrestlers who have sought an FIR against Mr. Singh.

“She (the complainant) has informed the Commission that instead of an FIR being filed in the matter, some of the complainants and their family members have started getting phone calls enquiring about the identities of the complainants from an IPS officer posted in Department of Sports, MYAS (Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports),” Ms. Maliwal wrote.

Terming is a serious matter concerning the safety of female wrestlers, the DCW chief asked the DCP to submit by Tuesday 4 p.m. a copy of FIR in the matter, reasons for delay, details of accused persons arrested in the matter, details of action taken against the official who leaked the complainant’s information with the officials at the Department of Sports, MYAS, among other details.

The women’s body also sought a detailed action taken report in the whole matter by Tuesday.

When contacted, there was no response form the Delhi Police on the matter.

Accusing Brij Bhushan of sexually harassing seven women wrestlers, which also includes a minor, the wrestlers said that they gave a complaint at Connaught Place Police Station two days back against the WFI chief but the police is yet to file an FIR.

Addressing a press conference, Sakshi Malik has said, ""We made a complaint at CP Police Station. It has been two days, but no FIR has been registered yet. Seven women complained, which also includes a minor. It makes for a POSCO case, but nothing has been done yet.""

Earlier in the day, Vinesh tweeted: ""Various female wrestlers who have brought laurels to this country have been sexually exploited and harassed by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, President, WFI. The Delhi Police is not registering the FIR despite complaints on 21.04.2023.""

This development comes three months after they first sat down in protest at Jantar Mantar (on January 18). There they had levelled various allegations against Singh and the federation, including sexual exploitation, mental harassment, death threats, and financial misappropriation.

Following that the Sports Ministry had intervened and constituted an investigation committee to both investigate the complaints of the wrestlers and take over the day-to-day functioning of the WFI. At the time the wrestlers had made known their disappointment that the government did not consult them before forming the oversight committee. The deadline for the committee to submit their report had initially been four weeks but had since been extended.

""It's been three months and we haven't got justice. That's why we are here again, to demand justice. We will sleep, eat here until we get justice,"" Vinesh said on Sunday.

""The committee should tell us what their decision is. It hasn't happened yet. At least, we should know if we were wrong, or who was wrong,"" Sakshi demanded. She added, ""We keep hearing that we're finished and that's the reason we are protesting. Are we really finished? We won medals at the latest Commonwealth Games. All we are hearing is that we are protesting because our wrestling careers are over. Why would we do this? We want to save wrestling. We are protesting to take wrestling away from those hands. We hope that truth will win.""

""The federation is organising nationals, they're running day-to-day affairs, their office is open, so where are they listening to us? So were we sitting here for nothing? If an FIR is registered, you'll know if we were lying or not. First you were saying we weren't filing a case, now when seven women have filed a complaint, they're not registering an FIR. We will not move from here unless he's arrested,"" Bajrang said.

Vinesh, speaking to ESPN two weeks ago, had said that she would be continuing the fight. ""What else can I do? Where else can I go? What will they do? Harm us?... There are so many people giving up their lives for the nation. Even our sacrifice will be remembered as the athletes who took a stand to save sports in the country. Who knows, this may bring about a positive change in sports. If sports improve because of an athlete, then is there a bigger medal than this? Winning this battle would be no less than a medal.""","Addressing a press conference, Sakshi Malik has said, ""We made a complaint at CP Police Station.

In Uttar Pradesh’s notorious gang wars, even crime is seen through the prism of caste and community. Which is why the sharply polarized reactions to the killing of criminal-politician Atiq Ahmad and his brother Ashraf in police custody and in the full glare of live tv cameras by ‘Jai Shri Ram’ chanting assassins should come as no surprise. While senior BJP ministers in UP have defended the cold blooded murder as ‘karmic’ retribution, opposition leaders have been just as strident in their denunciation of the Yogi Adityanath government. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi even went as far as likening the case to the gruesome murder of Ehsan Jafri during the 2002 Gujarat riots. The celebratory note struck by right wing internet Hindu groups on social media is deeply troubling: is Atiq’s murder in brazen violation of the rule of law justified because he is a mafia leader who happens to also be a Muslim?

Atiq’s projection as a ‘Muslim’ gangster is not an exception. In 2020, when gangster Vikas Dubey was killed in an ‘encounter’ with the UP police, social media narratives revolved around an element of Brahmin pride and victimhood. The Yogi government then was attacked for killing a ‘Brahmin Bahubali’ (strongman). The Yogi government, in fact, has been routinely accused of being partial to Thakur gang leaders, with the Samajwadi party media cell even coming up with a list of alleged criminals who are reportedly flourishing only because they belong to the same caste as the chief minister.

The Brahmin versus Thakur gang rivalries are not new in Purvanchal or eastern Uttar Pradesh. Nor are the Muslim versus Hindu gang battles. In the 1980s, Gorakhpur was the epicenter of an infamous gang war between ‘Brahmin’ don Hari Shankar Tiwari and Thakur ‘don’ Virendra Pratap Shahi. While Shahi was murdered in 1997, Tiwari – probably the first politician to win an election from jail – went on to become a key minister in several UP governments cutting across party lines. Likewise the war in the Varanasi-Ghazipur belt between Mukhtar Ansari and Brijesh Singh gangs, both again led by criminals turned politicians, has assumed a distinct Muslim versus Hindu character, Singh’s supporters even branding him as a ‘desh-bhakt’ don.

What explains this unique caste, community, crime and politics nexus in UP? Rewind to the late 1980s as the Congress began to decline in UP in the face of the Mandal-Mandir twin challenge. Between 1993 and 2017, UP only threw up one single party majority government – the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj party in 2007 : for almost a quarter of a century, unstable coalitions were the norm. Every seat mattered and ‘winnability’ mattered above all else. The criminal dons had the clout and resources to win seats in their areas of influence, often even when contesting as independents. Where once the criminals were dependent on politicians for patronage, rickety coalitions ensured a role reversal: around a third of UP’s MLAs had criminal cases against them in the 1990s.

Secondly, the aggressive ‘Mandalisation’ of politics where caste identities determined voting preferences meant that political parties were constantly searching for mascots of key caste groups. A caste badge was more important than a character or education certificate. For example, when ‘Bandit Queen’ Phoolan Devi was given a Lok Sabha ticket from the Samajwadi party (SP) in 1996, her Mallah or fisherfolk caste identity was a crucial factor in her selection: the SP was looking to widen its Yadav base to include other backward castes. Phoolan, who was later assassinated, went on to win her first election by more than 30,000 votes.

Thirdly, post the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, religion became deeply entwined with UP’s coarsened vote bank politics. Where once UP’s gangs were seen as ‘secular’ in their composition, the religious divide was now acute. Each gang leader brought along with him the guarantee of their community’s vote. Mulayam Singh’s Yadav-Muslim vote bank meant that the likes of Atique found refuge in the Samajwadi party, contesting and winning on an SP ticket in 1996 from Allahabad West, having won twice previously as an independent. A Mayawati, also competing for the Muslim vote, made another criminal strongman in Mukhtar Ansari her posterboy, calling him a ‘messiah of the poor’. The BJP, in turn, provided space for the likes of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, once accused of sheltering Dawood Ibrahim’s aides. Ironically, Dawood’s gang too was a ‘mixed’ one until the 1993 Mumbai blasts divided the Mumbai underworld too.

Finally, UP’s gang culture must also be located within the political economy of the state, especially in Purvanchal. A region beset with poverty and backwardness, private entrepreneurship has never really taken off here. This has increased the dependence on state funding and government contracts through political patronage. Guns are often available more easily than jobs and crime is seen as a lucrative form of illegal capital accumulation. Kidnapping, extortion, land grabbing: a parallel economy has revolved around the ‘bahubalis’ and their political affiliations.

When he first came to power in 2017, Yogi Adityanath vowed to finish this ‘mafia raj’: ‘agar apradh karenge, toh thok diye jayenge’ (if they commit crimes, we will knock them down) was the blunt message from a saffron-robed neta, ironically himself once accused of leading his own private vigilante army. More recently, he warned in the UP assembly that ‘Maafiyao ko mitti mein mila denge’ (we will destroy the mafias). These hard-hitting one-liners are designed to boost his tough on law and order ‘strongman’ image, a key factor in his re-election success last year. They have also provided a cover to the police to pursue with complete impunity an ‘encounter raj’ where the men in khaki have a licence to kill. The UP police only last week boasted of having gunned down 183 alleged criminals in the course of nearly 11,000 encounters in the last six years.

This ‘thok do’ policy must surely have its limits. While Atique’s killing may yield political dividends in UP’s communally surcharged milieu, it has dangerously short-circuited the criminal justice system. As a feared gangster with over a 100 cases against him, Atique deserves no sympathy; he did deserve though, like anyone else, Muslim or Hindu, the assurance of due process.

Post-script: At a media event last year, when Yogi Adityanath was asked about gangster Vikas Dubey’s car mysteriously over-turning leading to him being killed in an encounter, the chief minister shrugged it off by remarking ‘accidents do happen’. The audience clapped. Is Atique’s killing also to be seen as an ‘accident’ and be similarly celebrated?

Our protest will continue until WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is sent to jail...,None,"Veterans' Capital Gains: Warner, Ishant star in Delhi's first win of IPL season","New Delhi: Skipper David Warner found his perfect hitting arc after Ishant Sharma rolled back the years but even then Delhi Capitals stuttered badly in a modest chase before beating Kolkata Knight Riders by four wickets on Thursday to stay afloat in this edition of the IPL.



With their backs to the wall after five defeats on the trot, the DC bowling line-up collectively came to the party as KKR managed only 127 on a spicy deck which aided both pacers and spinners alike.

Warner, DC's best batter this season, was struggling with his strike-rate in earlier games but on Thursday, he smashed 57 off 41 with the target being reached with four balls to spare.



The DC batting, save Warner looked wobbly once again but a below-par score perhaps saved the day for the home team as the ball started gripping in the second half of the chase making it difficult for strokeplay. Axar Patel (19 not out off 22 balls) despite a groin strain managed to take his team past the finishing line.

DC's victory was about two veterans winning the Powerplay contest for their team.



The 34-year-old Ishant (2/19 in 4 overs), who is well past his prime, got his first opportunity and used his oodles of experience to peg back KKR inside the 'Bowling Powerplay'.

The 36-year-old Warner then showed his destructive avatar hitting as many as 10 boundaries in the 'Batting Powerplay' to kill the contest and earn his team's first win of the competition.



The manner in which he swept, the two KKR spinners Sunil Narine and Anukul Roy hardly had any answers. In all, he hit 11 boundaries.

The win doesn't alter DC's standing in the points table as they remain last but the victory does give them hope for a turnaround.



Once Warner won a good toss and opted to field, Ishant, playing his first IPL match in over two seasons, was bang on target with 13 dot balls and hitting those immaculate three-quarter lengths, just like yesterday.

In rhythm, he still hits 140 clicks but once he was done with his four overs, he literally collapsed in the dug-out chair as Prithvi Shaw came in as 'Impact Player'.



His India days are well over and Ishant certainly would like to remain an 'IPL to IPL' player till his body allows him to take rigours of top flight cricket.

Mukesh Kumar (1/34 in 4 overs) also bowled well in the Powerplay while Axar (2/13 in 3 overs), who hasn't enjoyed favourable match-ups against left-handers, removed the dangerous Rinku Singh as KKR lost wickets in clumps.



If Ishant, Mukesh and Axar were brilliant in the front 10, Kuldeep Yadav (2/15 in 3 overs), who got Jason Roy (43 off 39 balls), was brilliant as he created doubts in the minds of the batters by varying his pace.

The pitch had a liberal tinge of green and Anrich Nortje (2/20 in 4 overs) bowled an ideal Test match length and the grass covering helped in a bit of deviation as in-form Venkatesh Iyer just managed to dangle his bat and the ball flew to Mitchell Marsh standing at first slip.



It was undoubtedly the ball of the innings but credit goes to Ishant as he didn't let Roy get away with a good start.

The bit of moisture after a delayed start due to steady drizzle had also freshened up the track and the bit of extra bounce found the batters in a bit of a problem.



Mukesh got rid of Litton Das, who miscued a pull, and the ball that Ishant bowled to dismiss Nitish Rana reared up and he couldn't check his lofted shot.

However, the wicket that completely changed the course was Rinku's slog sweep and the ball bounced tad extra to take the top edge and flew at a comfortable height for Lalit Yadav to catch it at deep square leg.

Once Rinku was gone, KKR batting unit seemed like losing the battle in its head as Andre Russell (38 not out off 31 balls), despite hitting four sixes, couldn't do enough to get his team to a par-score which was surpassed easily.(PTI)","Axar Patel (19 not out off 22 balls) despite a groin strain managed to take his team past the finishing line.

First India,47:27.4,SC grants bail to 8 convicts in Godhara train coach-burning case,https://www.firstindia.co.in/news/delhi/sc-grants-bail-to-8-convicts-in-godhara-train-coach-burning-case,"Our protest will continue until WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is sent to jail, says protesting wrestlers. Top News. LSG beat PBKS by 56 runs.",None,SC grants bail to 8 convicts in Godhara train coach-burning case,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to eight convicts in the 2002 Godhra train coach-burning case.

However the top court refused to consider bail application of other four other convicts in view of their role. A bench headed by Chief Justice of DY Chandrachud granted bail to the eight convicts.

These eight people were those who were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment and their sentences were upheld by the trial court order.

The top court has earlier denied the bail application of those accused persons whose death sentence awarded by the trial Court was commuted to life imprisonment by the Gujarat High Court.

The top court noted that the sentence of death which was awarded by the trial Court has been commuted to life imprisonment by the High Court and the State Government has preferred appeals against the order of the High Court.

11 accused were sentenced death penalty by the trial court. Later Gujarat HC commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment.

Gujarat Government on Monday reiterated that the convicts of the 2002 Godhra train coach-burning case were involved in serious offences as they pelted stones and bolted the door of the train and opposed their bail plea.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted before the top court that it is just not a case of stone pelting but the accused had bolted the door of the train from outside and then pelted stones.

However, the convicts' lawyers submitted that they have served 17 years in prison.

The court on Monday also remarked that it is thinking of not granting bail to the ones who were given a death sentence.

The court was hearing bail pleas of some convicts sentenced to life imprisonment in the 2002 Godhra train coach-burning case.

In the earlier hearing, the SC sought a chart mentioning the specific role of convicts, their age and the period undergone by them in matters pertaining to the 2002 Godhra train coach-burning case.

The court asked the advocates on record appearing on behalf of the petitioner and state counsel to sit together and prepare one consolidated chart for the convenience of the bench.

Appearing for the State of Gujarat, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta has strongly opposed the bail pleas of the convicts saying that it was a very serious crime. He has submitted that it was the rarest of rare offences.

He has also submitted that the cases of convicts could not be considered for premature release under the Gujarat state's policy as TADA provisions had been invoked against them

The court was hearing the bail pleas of some convicts in the matter. The state government has also filed appeals against the Gujarat High Court order which has commuted the sentence of some convicts from the death penalty to life imprisonment.

Around 58 people lost their lives when some coaches of Sabarmati Express were torched at the Godhra Railway Station in Gujarat on February 27, 2002.

The incident triggered large-scale riots in Gujarat. A local court in 2011 convicted 31 accused and acquitted 63 people. 11 accused were sentenced death penalty while the rest were awarded life imprisonment.

Later Gujarat High Court upheld the trial court decision to convict the 31 accused but commuted the death sentence of the 11 to life imprisonment.

Convicts moved the Supreme Court challenging the Gujarat High Court order. (ANI)","New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to eight convicts in the 2002 Godhra train coach-burning case.

Top News. LSG beat PBKS by 56 runs.",None,Amit Shah suggests identifying 5 major areas to strengthen approach of SCO,"New Delhi: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday suggested identifying five major areas to further strengthen the approach of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the meeting of Heads of Departments of SCO member-states responsible for prevention and elimination of emergency situations.

Chairing the meet, Shah pointed out that these five major areas include Confidence Building Efforts in Asia, Collective Responsibility Approach, Expanding Cooperation in Communication and Information Sharing, Identification of Priority Areas, and use of newly developed technology in disaster resilience capacity building. Shah, while speaking about the five areas in detail, said adopting a collective responsibility approach for disaster resilience will help SCO member-states to work together, more effectively.

""Along with this, by pooling our resources and expertise, Member States can avoid duplication of efforts and resources, and this will strengthen the region's overall disaster resilience approach,"" said a Ministry of Home Affairs statement quoting the minister.

Shah said the SCO member-states can expand their cooperation on emergency situations by exchanging best practices of communication, coordination of response efforts and real-time information exchange.

The minister said that effective communication and information exchange can help ensure timely, specialised and coordinated response to emergent situation, and that new and developed technology can play an important role in disaster resilience capacity building.

""SCO member-states can share their experience and knowledge in the successful use of technologies, such as, Artificial Intelligence, Remote Sensing, Drone Technology and Data Analytics to improve in Early Warning Systems, Disaster Risk Assessment and Response,"" said Shah.

The Home minister said similar technologies can also help in increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of our response efforts as it can prove to be a game-changer in search and rescue operations.



Concluding his address, the minister expressed confidence that the meeting in New Delhi will open up new avenues of cooperation among Member Countries.

Shah said India attached special importance to the SCO in promoting dialogue on the subject relating to multi-dimensional political, security and economic subjects.

Shah said India has been associated with the SCO since 2005 and was playing an important role as an observer country, since then.

At the 17th Summit in 2017, Shah mentioned that India became a full member of the SCO as part of an important step in the process of expansion of this organisation.

He said under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is committed to exploring and availing new opportunities to the fullest possible extent and was willing to cooperate in sharing our experience in enhancing the role of SCO in the World Forum.

Noting that India attaches special importance to Disaster Risk Reduction and is ready to share its expertise and experience in this field for greater cooperation and mutual trust among SCO member-states, Shah said India believes that no hazard is small or big and it does not leave anyone behind.

He also said India now has more accurate and timely early warning system in place and the country has seen a sea change in the way its early warning systems (EWS) of drought, flood, lightning, heat wave, cold wave, and cyclone have improved.

A few men stood in front of a blue-framed door in the Bagcilar district of Turkey’s biggest city, Istanbul, earlier this month. One of them, tall and very agitated, shouted out a question.

“Can I go to Syria and kill someone there?” he demanded. “No.”

The man was angry because his brother, a textile worker, was shot dead by a Syrian in a clash between two groups.

The presidential candidate of the right-wing nationalist Ata Alliance, Sinan Ogan, visited the family.

“I promise you we will send the Syrians back as soon as possible. We won’t allow another Turk to be murdered by a Syrian,” he said.

Ogan is one of four candidates running in the May 14 presidential elections. The 55-year-old politician started out in the Ulkucu, or Gray Wolves, movement. He was kicked out of the ultra-nationalist MHP party after an intra-party power struggle. Just weeks ahead of the vote, his approval ratings are between 1.3% and 2.5%, according to surveys.

Ogan and the Ata Alliance are not the only ones stirring up anti-refugee feelings. With the exception of the pro-Kurdish Green-Left Alliance, all other alliances have pledged to immediately send almost 4 million Syrians back to neighbouring Syria if they win the election.

Another politician banking on anti-refugee sentiment is Kemal Kilicdaroglu, head of the CHP opposition party and presidential candidate for the largest opposition alliance. Years ago, Kilicdaroglu sensed Turkish people’s resentment and made refugee policy one of his priorities. Should he win the vote, he says he will negotiate with the Syrian regime concerning the return of refugees.

His alliance included the issue in its election program along with a pledge to review the refugee pact with the European Union and conclude a separate repatriation agreement with third countries.

The alliance also wants to monitor porous border crossings with new technologies and drones and build walls to prevent uncontrolled migration if necessary. Visa facilitation with various states would also be discussed.

Until a year ago, the ruling AKP party protected Syrians, viewing them above all as cheap labor indispensable to the Turkish economy. However, as Turkish society’s acceptance of Syrians dwindles in view of the economic crisis, inflation and poverty, the AKP has changed its tune.

“With the realisation that the Syrians wouldn’t return home after a few years, the mood changed,” said Murat Erdogan, a migration researcher at Turkey’s Ankara University.

The opposition parties were the first to pick up on the growing discontent in the population, he said, and the AKP party followed suit after scoring points among voters with the refugee issue. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he would prepare for the voluntary and safe return of Syrians and that his party would continue to fight illegal migration.

“The AKP has recently been bragging about high deportation figures,” the migration researcher said.

Over the past five years, Murat Erdogan has conducted the Syrians Barometer survey, which examines the lives of Turks and Syrians and takes a close look at their coexistence in Turkey.

Every year, the survey asks people how important the refugee issue is for Turkish society. In past years, the issue has always been rated as significant, landing among the top three or four topics.","Should he win the vote, he says he will negotiate with the Syrian regime concerning the return of refugees.

The committee will also hold elections to IOA ’s new executive committee (EC) following the charges of sexual harassment against the wrestling body’s underfire chief, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, by the country’s top female wrestlers.IOA will also appoint a retired High Court judge to assist the committee for fair and transparent election. The transitory body will be responsible for managing the affairs of the federation, including selection and participation of sportspersons in international events. The wrestling federation’s earlier proposed election on May 7 was declared null and void by the sports ministry earlier this week after wrestlers led by Bajrang Punia , Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik sat on dharna at Jantar Mantar here demanding filing of an FIR against Singh and his arrest by Delhi police.“Suma is from IOA’s SOM and Bajwa is an EC representative. It’s imperative that day-to-day functioning of the federation isn’t affected. One retired HC judge will be added soon. The judge will guide the committee from the legal standpoint.

The committee will start functioning immediately once Bajwa, also the Wushu Association of India (WAI) president, returns after attending the chefs-de-mission meeting in Hangzhou, China on Friday. He is India’s chef-de-mission for the Hangzhou Asiad, scheduled from September 23 to October 8.The IOA’s constitution doesn’t allow for any such ad-hoc committee to manage the affairs of national sports federations (NSFs), which calls for their independence and autonomy. Asked about it, Chaubey said, “There are exceptions in the world. You know that the Asian Games and National Games are very close... therefore, if IOA's intervention can help the sport, that’ll be for the interest of the country.”Talking about the IOA’s own probe into the sexual harassment charges against Singh, Chaubey informed that the investigation was going on. “The (M C Mary Kom-led) committee has a list of witnesses. These witnesses will be invited to depose before the committee. Based on that, the report will be submitted to us (IOA).” It’s been learnt that the panel will take another month to complete its probe as around 20 more witnesses are yet to depose before it.","The committee will also hold elections to IOA ’s new executive committee (EC) following the charges of sexual harassment against the wrestling body’s underfire chief, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, by the country’s top female wrestlers.IOA will also appoint a retired High Court judge to assist the committee for fair and transparent election.

This is as requested by the sports ministry in a letter to the IOA president on Monday.

Elections that had earlier been declared for May 7 have been declared void and it's been requested that the new ad-hoc committee conduct the same within 45 days of its formation. That committee will also oversee day-to-day affairs of the Federation.

The letter also says that the Oversight Committee that had been formed in January to investigate allegations against WFI and its president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has submitted its report and has now ceased to exist.

The preliminary findings of the committee are -

There was no Internal Complaints Committee and there was a lack of an adequate mechanism for awareness building, and for grievance redressal.

There is a need for transparency and consultation between the Federation and stakeholders (including sportspersons).

There is a need for effective communication between Federation and sportspersons.

It is pertinent to note that none of the allegations raised by the wrestlers have been addressed in these preliminary findings and it remains to be seen if the report will do the same.

Reacting to this development, Vinesh Phogat said, ""A committee had been made to manage the day-to-day working [of the WFI - the Oversight Committee] but it was still being run by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and his people, so we are not focusing on this. We are also not focused on the elections... our fight is to ensure FIR is filed on the complaints of sexual harassment made against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and that he is arrested, we want the police to investigate this thoroughly and the honourable court to provide us justice. This is our fight, and we will stay here till we are successful.""

She added, ""We want the findings of the committee on the sexual harassment complaints made by the wrestlers. If they have not found anything then FIR should be filed on us. If they do find, FIR should filed on Brij Bhushan.""

On Sunday, the wrestlers -- led by Olympic medalists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, and Worlds medalist Vinesh Phogat -- returned to the site of protest that had sparked all this in January. They said that they had received no information about the report or any potential findings and that no one from the Ministry was answering their queries.

They also said that they had raised a complaint at Connaught Place police station (in New Delhi) against WFI president Singh -- with seven women wrestlers (including a minor) accusing him of sexual harassment -- but the police had refused to file an FIR.

Once they...",None,"Who Is BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, at the Heart of Serious Charges By Wrestlers?","New Delhi: “I have committed a murder in the past. Let people say what they want…I did commit a murder.”

This is not the confession of a convicted criminal, but a bold declaration made by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a BJP leader and six-time Lok Sabha MP who has never been tried for murder.

Though tales of the muscle power wielded by Singh, the MP from the Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh, are well-known, especially in Gonda and its surrounding districts, it is likely that no one knew that Singh had committed a murder until an interview he gave to a web portal in 2022. His affidavit submitted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections did mention four criminal cases, including one under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 307 (attempt to murder) and other serious crimes.

Singh has also been the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) since 2011, and there are allegations that he often resorts to the use of muscle power in running the federation. As a result of his tyrannical attitude, Olympic-level wrestlers were forced to hold a protest against him, staging a dharna at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar from January 18.

The protestors made serious allegations against Singh, including sexual harassment of women wrestlers, physical abuse, dictatorial functioning and financial irregularities in the management of WFI. The players called off the protest after a late-night meeting with sports minister Anurag Thakur on January 20, in which they were given an assurance that Singh would be relieved of his duties as WFI president and an inquiry committee would be set up.

Now, saying that they have lost faith in the committee, the wrestlers are back on protest. They have filed a police complaint against Singh, which also includes allegations of sexual assault on a minor. However, the police are yet to register an FIR – and the protesting wrestlers have said they will not leave Jantar Mantar until an FIR is filed. They have even approached the Supreme Court on the matter.

Meanwhile, regarding the allegations levelled against him, Singh claimed that he would hang himself if the charges were found to be true. He refused to resign from his post as president, calling the allegations politically motivated and terming it a Congress-sponsored protest. He even warned that if he opened his mouth, it would bring a ‘tsunami’. He compared the wrestlers’ protest with the Shaheen Bagh protest and added that a few players whose careers are over are levelling allegations against him.

However, Singh, who calls the protesting sportspersons as pawns of the Congress, does not have a slate as clean as he pretends. While he himself proclaimed on camera that he has committed a murder, on another occasion he reportedly confessed that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had held him responsible for “another murder”.

The many crimes of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh

Ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Scroll had quoted senior journalists from Gonda district as saying that Singh’s involvement in crime in the 1980s ranged from motorcycle/bike theft to running liquor shops. He even used to get boys to hunt for coins lying at the bottom of temple ponds. Soon he became a civil contractor. Vinod Kumar Singh alias Pandit Singh, a former minister in the Samajwadi Party cabinet in UP, was his associate in all these activities.

Later, Brij Bhushan and Pandit Singh turned from friends to foes and in 1993 Brij Bhushan was charged under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (spreading nuisance), 148 (possessing deadly weapon) and 149 (offence committed by every member of an unlawful assembly with common object) for shooting at Pandit Singh. Pandit Singh had claimed in an interview to Scroll that 20 bullets were fired at him and he was hospitalised for 14 months.

In the case which lasted for 29 years, Brij Bhushan was acquitted in December last year due to the lack of evidence. However, the court pulled up the investigators, saying that during the investigation no effort was made to collect evidence and even the weapon used in the crime could not be recovered.

In his defence, Brij Bhushan had argued that he was in Delhi at the time of the attack. In response, the judge said that no effort was made by the investigators to verify this claim, which makes the entire investigation questionable.

Pandit Singh, the victim in the case, died in May 2021 after contracting COVID-19 about a year and a half before the verdict. One of the reasons for Brij Bhushan’s acquittal in this case was that Pandit Singh did not appear to record a statement against him. When asked why in an interview in 2014, the latter replied, “If I decide to testify against Brij Bhushan in the 1993 firing case, I can get him behind bars. But I have restrained myself from doing so because I want to keep him alive. It is fun to fight with a strong person. You stay alert and don’t make mistakes.”

‘… I did commit a murder’

Pandit Singh had a brother, Ravinder Singh, who was a very close friend of Brij Bhushan’s. Both of them were contractors and used to work together. Once they had gone to hold a panchayat meeting where shots were fired in the air and one bullet hit Ravinder while he was standing next to Brij Bhushan. It enraged Bhushan so much that he snatched the rifle from the hands of the person who had fired the shot and shot him. The person died on the spot.

This incident was narrated by Brij Bhushan himself in an interview to the online portal Lallantop. In the interview, he said, “I have committed a murder in the past. Whatever people may say, I did commit a murder. I immediately shot and killed the person who had shot Ravinder dead.”

He further said in the interview that Lallu Singh, who is currently the BJP MP from the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat in Ayodhya district, is a witness to the incident.

He added that some time after the incident, he was sent to jail under the Gangster Act by veteran leader and former minister of Gonda, Kunwar Anand Singh.

Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had also suspected Bhushan of committing another murder, the latter confessed. After the death of the BJP candidate of Gonda Lok Sabha seat, the former prime minister had said, “(You) got him killed.”

Brij Bhushan is a six-time MP, winning five times on a BJP ticket and once (in 2009) on an SP ticket. He won the first two elections in 1991 and 1999 from the Gonda Lok Sabha seat. In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP gave him a ticket from Balrampur and nominated Ghanshyam Shukla from Gonda. Shukla died in a road accident on the day of polling.

Recalling it in a conversation with Scroll, Brij Bhushan said, “My opponents spread rumours that it was not an accident but a murder. Atal ji called me and said,‘Marwa diya (You got him killed).’”

Brij Bhushan added that this led to his differences with the BJP. As a result, he made headlines by cross-voting against his own party in a crucial confidence motion by the opposition against the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2008. The BJP expelled him, but the SP opened its doors for him.

He was elected MP from Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat in 2009 on an SP ticket. In 2014, he rejoined the BJP and again became an MP from Kaiserganj, repeating his victory in 2019 as well.

It is noteworthy that he remained in the BJP even after the then prime minister had expressed his suspicion of that Bhushan had murdered a BJP candidate. The BJP expelled him only after his cross-vote.

However, Brij Bhushan’s political clout remained unaffected. Despite his confession of having committed a murder and being accused of another murder by the then PM, both the BJP and the opposition SP embraced him and covered up his crimes as he continued to get tickets and win election after election. For more than a decade, he has been the president of a national sports association.

According to the Indian Express, he likes to be referred to as ‘powerful’ and believes that he doesn’t need the BJP as much as the BJP needs him. In his home district of Gonda in Uttar Pradesh and at least half a dozen adjoining districts, he wields a lot of influence.

A local BJP leader from Gonda told the newspaper, “Brij Bhushan only borrows the party symbol, he doesn’t need it to win the election. He wins them on his own.”

He has more than 50 educational institutions running in Bahraich, Gonda, Balrampur, Ayodhya and Shravasti districts of UP which is also a source of his political domination in the region, something he admits.

He said, “I did not establish them (college) with any political motive, but today boys rally around me. People may call me mafia, but my students idolise me. Earlier I used to touch the feet of Brahmins, today young Brahmins touch my feet calling me Guruji.”

This is the reason why Brij Bhushan, who maintains a stature bigger than the party in the region, challenges his own party and its decisions with hardly any adverse consequences.

In October last year, while targeting the BJP government in UP, he said that he had never seen such poor management of floods and that people are at God’s mercy. On a question asked regarding chief minister Adityanath, he said, “Don’t make me say anything.”

In addition, he even praised SP leader Azam Khan, the biggest thorn in the BJP’s side in UP, by calling him a ‘leader of the people’.

In June last year, when Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray expressed his desire to visit Ayodhya, Brij Bhushan went against the party line and opposed Thackeray’s visit at a time when the BJP was considering MNS as an ally during a tumultuous phase of Maharashtrian politics.

“I will not allow Raj Thackeray, who insulted North Indians, to enter Ayodhya until he apologises to all North Indians with folded hands,” he claimed. “I request chief minister Yogi Adityanath to not meet him. The RSS, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the common man played a role in the Ram Mandir movement. The Thackeray family has nothing to do with it.”

He also launched a tirade against yoga guru and businessman Ramdev, accusing his company Patanjali of selling spurious ghee and warned him of a nationwide agitation against Patanjali’s products, terming him the ‘king of adulteration‘. He also called upon the Sant community to stand against Ramdev and appealed to the Centre as well as the UP and Uttarakhand governments to take action against the latter.

Brij Bhushan Singh’s image of a staunch Hindutva leader also corresponds with the political ideology of the BJP. His controversial remarks, for instance, about the ancestors of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, calling them Hindu, only help the BJP’s cause. This is perhaps why his defiance against the party is largely ignored by the top brass.

Brij Bhushan’s long tryst with controversies

Brij Bhushan joined the BJP in the late 1990s having studied law at the Awadh University. It was the era of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and he caught the BJP’s eye because of his good standing in the areas around Ayodhya. Today, his wife Ketki Devi Singh is the Gonda District Panchayat President while his son Prateek Bhushan Singh is the MLA from Gonda Sadar seat.

Brij Bhushan was one of the prominent faces of the Ram Mandir movement and was also arrested along with senior BJP leader L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and former chief minister Kalyan Singh in the Babri demolition case in which he was the main accused. In 2020, the court acquitted all the accused including Brij Bhushan.

In an attempt to cash in on his image as a staunch Hindutva leader, he boasts, “During the movement, I was the first person from the area to be arrested by Mulayam Singh. I was also the first person arrested by the CBI after the controversial structure was demolished.”

In the mid-1990s, his relationship with the underworld also came to the fore. He spent several months in Tihar Jail on charges of harbouring members of the Dawood Ibrahim gang. A case was registered against him under the Terrorist and Divisive Activities Prevention Act (TADA). He was later acquitted due to the lack of evidence.

While he was in jail, his wife contested on the BJP ticket from Gonda Lok Sabha seat and won.

In 2004, Brij Bhushan’s 22-year-old son Shakti Singh died by suicide, leaving a suicide note in which he blamed his father Brij Bhushan for the act. “You could not prove to be a good father. You did not take care of my siblings and me. You always thought about yourself and did not care about us. We see our future in darkness. That’s why there is no point in living now,” the note read.

Tyrannical attitude as wrestling federation head

In managing the WFI, Brij Bhushan has often been accused of being a self-centred narcissist, which is also reflected in his remarks. For instance, he reportedly said in an interview to the Indian Express in 2021, “They (wrestlers) are strong boys and girls. You need someone strong to control them. Is there anyone stronger than me here?”

The report stated how his is the final word in every matter related to wrestling in the federation. He keeps an eye on every minor and major wrestling tournament and often gives instructions to the referee and even punishes the judges.

Referring to a few standout anecdotes about his dictatorial attitude, the report said that he suspended a railway coach during a national championship in Noida in January 2021. He asked the referee to penalise a wrestler from Delhi because the wrestler’s supporters had entered the playing arena. The referee said there was no such rule but Singh insisted upon it.

If he is unable to be physically present at a tournament, he monitors it from home by getting cameras installed everywhere at the venue, something he himself admitted.

The report further added that the wrestlers are well aware of Brij Bhushan’s attitude. Therefore, when they lose in a controversial match, instead of going to the judge, they appeal directly to him.

Meanwhile, scenes of wrestlers bowing before Brij Bhushan and seeking blessings from him are also common during the matches of the national championship in Indian wrestling.

His influence is such that he recently lashed out at the Union government’s ‘Target Olympic Podium (TOP)’ scheme for the preparation of athletes for Olympics, and asked the government not to directly approach the athletes under this scheme.

Meanwhile, after the Tokyo Olympics last year, he had said that the federation would keep an eye on private, non-profit organisations supporting wrestlers.

Speaking to The Print, a former Sports Authority of India coach said, “Brij Bhushan is the goon that wrestling needs. Without him, it would be very difficult to discipline or keep wrestlers under control.”

His hooliganism was witnessed in 2021 during a junior level wrestling tournament in Ranchi, when he started hitting a wrestler on stage.

Dronacharya awardee Mahavir Phogat had also told the media in detail about Singh’s attitude in running the federation and claimed that apart from interfering with the diet of the wrestlers, he also takes half of the sponsorship money they receive.

New Delhi, April 26

Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat have once again alleged that Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s people are threatening the complainants. The wrestlers claimed that Singh’s people have found out the address of the minor girl who is one of the seven wrestlers that have filed a complaint of sexual harassment against Singh.

The wrestlers were seen training at the protest site on Wednesday. PTI

“Brij Bhushan is claiming innocence while he is threatening the minor girl,” Bajrang said. “Not many here know her name but people have reached her house. If he is innocent then why is he resorting to such acts?” he added.

Bajrang added that the same people are pressuring her relatives to withdraw the complaint. He also alleged that two persons tried to scare him off the case as well.

“Today, two persons approached me and warned me, asking why I was picking up a fight with him. They told me ‘once his party did not give him the ticket, the one who got the ticket was killed the day of the voting’. They are trying to scare us but we have the support of the country. We are not scared,” he said.

As the police were still reluctant to lodge an FIR against Singh, the wrestlers carried out a candlelight procession.

The wrestlers also tried training near the dharna site, though no sparring sessions could take place as the Delhi Police did not allow them to get the mats to the dharna site.

“We trained for a bit in the morning,” Bajrang said. “We had brought the mats but the police did not allow us to place them here. When we were training on the roads, they said you can’t train as we did not have the permission. They do the same thing when we are trying to get food and water. Do we need to take permission to breathe, eat and train?” he added.

“When it comes to medals, everybody joins in and says our wrestlers have made us proud and now that we are out on the road, can’t they see our troubles. We should be in stadiums training, not sitting here. We are very hurt by all of this,” he added.

Listen to our Mann ki Baat

Sakshi and Vinesh urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani to hear the wrestler’s “mann ki baat”.

“PM Modi sir says beti bachao, beti padhao. He listens to everyone’s mann ki baat and I want to ask him whether he is listening to us at all. You call us at your house and give us respect so I request you to please listen to our mann ki baat as well,” Sakshi said.

“I also want to ask Smriti Irani ji, why have you not said anything in our matter? We have been sitting here for the last four days, suffering from mosquito bites. The Delhi Police are not allowing us food. They are not allowing us to train, why are you mum? Please come and support us,” the Rio bronze medallist added.

Vinesh questioned why the PM did not reach out to them. “Who knows our voices may not be reaching him. We do not have his direct number where we can contact him. All we can do is to request a meeting through the media,” Vinesh said. “We have been saying that we wanted to meet him from the start. We have taken a huge risk with our careers for this big fight,” she added.

‘Deeply concerning’

New Delhi: Olympics champion shooter Abhinav Bindra took to social media to announce his solidarity with the protesting wrestlers. Bindra has always voiced his opinion in favour of distressed sportspersons. “As athletes, we train hard every day to represent our country on the international stage. It is deeply concerning to see our athletes finding it necessary to protest on the streets regarding the allegations of harassment in the Indian wrestling administration,” Bindra tweeted. Bindra said that all the concerns raised by top wrestlers should be addressed by the administration. “My heart goes out to all those who have been affected. We must ensure that this issue is handled properly, with the athletes’ concerns heard and addressed fairly and independently. This incident highlights the crucial need for a proper safeguarding mechanism that can prevent harassment and ensure justice for those affected,” he said. pti

On the third day of the protest, two-time World Championship medallist Vinesh Phogat said threats were being made to ‘break the resolve’ of the complainants. Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia accused Singh’s coterie of threatening the family of the minor, one of the seven complainants.

“They are trying to threaten the minor victim and pressure is being put on the family members to withdraw the complaint. We have learned that one of the people threatening them is a coach who is a Dronacharya-award winner and the other is the secretary of the Haryana Wrestling Association. They went to her house and are putting pressure on the family and also offered money. They want her to take the complaint back. Those women wrestlers who have filed complaints against the WFI president are being threatened too,” Bajrang said at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday.

The complaints were filed on Friday at the Connaught Place Police Station in New Delhi, and it is learnt that the wrestlers have cited multiple instances of sexual harassment, dating back to 2012 and as recent as 2022.

What is unfortunate, Vinesh said, is that the names of the victims who registered the complaints at the police station seem to have been leaked to the WFI president.

“If a girl makes a complaint of sexual harassment, what should the police do? There needs to be an FIR, an arrest should be made under POCSO (The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act). But why have the police not done these basic things so far? And now the complainants are being threatened and being asked to withdraw the case,” Vinesh said.

Unlike in January when they sat in protest till dusk and returned the next morning, this time the wrestlers, including Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik, are spending the night at Jantar Mantar. The protesting wrestlers have said they have lost faith in the Oversight Committee set up by the sports ministry to probe the allegations of sexual harassment against the WFI president.

The report of the Oversight Committee headed by boxing legend Mary Kom has not been made public despite the one-month deadline expiring by the end of February.

The government on Monday shared the ‘major findings’ of the Oversight Committee but remained silent on the charges against the WFI president.

In a letter to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president and former sprint queen PT Usha, the sports ministry mentioned only the structural lapses within the WFI, including the absence of an Internal Complaints Committee, and called for “effective communication between the Federation and the sportspersons”. The ministry also declared the ongoing process for the WFI elections, scheduled to take place on May 7, as null and void, and directed the IOA to form an ad-hoc committee.

No going back

“Hamare saath game ho gaya (We were fooled the last time). We believed we would get justice and that is why we ended the protest after three days. But this time, we won’t get swayed by false promises. Till the investigation is taken to its conclusion, and arrests are made based on the complaints, we will not stop protesting. We have faith in the Supreme Court,” Vinesh said.

The wrestlers made it clear that just filing an FIR against the accused was not enough.

“We won’t end our protest when an FIR is lodged. He (the WFI president) has to be arrested and put behind bars. So many people roam around freely despite an FIR being lodged against them. Will we be safe if he is free? And how will we train, if he is roaming free?” Vinesh said between meeting politicians from different parties, members of farmer unions and khap leaders.

The wrestlers had sought the support of political parties and women’s organisations on Monday in a departure from their earlier stand. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Communist Party of India leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Brinda Karat and Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Reena Gupta were among those who met the wrestlers on Tuesday.

“The question is why those athletes, who should have been at a stadium, are being forced to sit in protest at Jantar Mantar. There needs to be a thorough investigation into the matter. The athletes need to get justice and my full support is with them,” Hooda tweeted.

Local leaders from Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, who were involved in the farmer protests, also came forward with the promise of hundreds of supporters travelling to Jantar Mantar over the next few days.

“Earlier (in January), we didn’t want the people from political parties to come to the protest site because then people would say we are trying to play politics. But after that, we were fooled. We have asked everyone to come, including politicians, farmers and khap leaders because people want to support us and are fighting for the self-respect and dignity of women wrestlers. This is not about Uttar Pradesh versus Haryana. The UP-Haryana story is being spread by those who want us to fail and those who are close to Brijbhushan Sharan Singh,” Vinesh said.

By evening, there was a power failure at the protest site, as the microphones fell silent and the fans stopped working. “Whatever happens, we will be here at Jantar Mantar night and day till our women wrestlers get justice,” Jitender, an Asian Wrestling Championship silver medallist, said.","On the third day of the protest, two-time World Championship medallist Vinesh Phogat said threats were being made to ‘break the resolve’ of the complainants.

Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on Tuesday did not directly reply to questions over protesting wrestlers' allegations against him and said the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.

Some prominent wrestlers, who have resumed their protest seeking registration of criminal case on their allegations against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, moved the Supreme Court on Monday.

""The matter is in the Supreme Court and the court will decide,"" Brij Bhushan Singh told media persons.

The wrestlers said they had resumed the protest as ""no action has been taken in the matter"".

Ace India wrestler Sakshi Malik broke down while interacting with the media as wrestlers protested at Jantar Mantar.

Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia are among those who have resumed their protest over their demands.

""We wanted to file a sexual harassment FIR against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Two days ago we got a complaint filed but FIR hasn't been registered yet. There are seven female wrestlers and one of them is a minor. We want the investigation to happen fast. It is a sensitive matter. We are being framed as liars which we cannot bear. We are waiting for two-and-a-half months now but no one is listening. People are saying we are spent force that is why we are protesting. We just won a medal at CWG 2022,"" Sakshi Malik told the media at Jantar Mantar.

""It is being heard that we are finished, that's why we are protesting. For two and a half months the government has not taken any action. We cannot reveal the name of a minor,"" she added.

Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Ravi Dahiya, and Sakshi Malik, held a sit-in protest in Jantar Mantar in January this year, demanding that Brij Bhushan be removed from and Wrestling Federation of India be disbanded. They had accused the body and its chief of sexual harassment and mistreatment of wrestlers.

Following the protest, the Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports had announced the formation of an 'oversight committee' to probe the allegations.

Olympic medalist Mary Kom is heading the Oversight Committee. Former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former shuttler Trupti Murgunde, SAI member Radhica Sreeman, ex-CEO of the Target Olympic Podium Plan Rajesh Rajagopalan, and CWG gold medalist Babita Phogat are the other members of the Mary Kom-led committee.

The committee will also hold elections to IOA ’s new executive committee (EC) following the charges of sexual harassment against the wrestling body’s underfire chief, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, by the country’s top female wrestlers.IOA will also appoint a retired High Court judge to assist the committee for fair and transparent election. The transitory body will be responsible for managing the affairs of the federation, including selection and participation of sportspersons in international events. The wrestling federation’s earlier proposed election on May 7 was declared null and void by the sports ministry earlier this week after wrestlers led by Bajrang Punia , Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik sat on dharna at Jantar Mantar here demanding filing of an FIR against Singh and his arrest by Delhi police.“Suma is from IOA’s SOM and Bajwa is an EC representative. It’s imperative that day-to-day functioning of the federation isn’t affected. One retired HC judge will be added soon. The judge will guide the committee from the legal standpoint. It will be an athlete-friendly body,” said IOA’s joint secretary and acting CEO, Kalyan Chaubey. The committee will start functioning immediately once Bajwa, also the Wushu Association of India (WAI) president, returns after attending the chefs-de-mission meeting in Hangzhou, China on Friday. He is India’s chef-de-mission for the Hangzhou Asiad, scheduled from September 23 to October 8.The IOA’s constitution doesn’t allow for any such ad-hoc committee to manage the affairs of national sports federations (NSFs), which calls for their independence and autonomy. Asked about it, Chaubey said, “There are exceptions in the world. You know that the Asian Games and National Games are very close... therefore, if IOA's intervention can help the sport, that’ll be for the interest of the country.”Talking about the IOA’s own probe into the sexual harassment charges against Singh, Chaubey informed that the investigation was going on. “The (M C Mary Kom-led) committee has a list of witnesses. These witnesses will be invited to depose before the committee.

Elections that had earlier been declared for May 7 have been declared void and it's been requested that the new ad-hoc committee conduct the same within 45 days of its formation. That committee will also oversee day-to-day affairs of the Federation.

The letter also says that the Oversight Committee that had been formed in January to investigate allegations against WFI and its president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has submitted its report and has now ceased to exist.

The preliminary findings of the committee are -

There was no Internal Complaints Committee and there was a lack of an adequate mechanism for awareness building, and for grievance redressal.

There is a need for transparency and consultation between the Federation and stakeholders (including sportspersons).

There is a need for effective communication between Federation and sportspersons.

It is pertinent to note that none of the allegations raised by the wrestlers have been addressed in these preliminary findings and it remains to be seen if the report will do the same.

Reacting to this development, Vinesh Phogat said, ""A committee had been made to manage the day-to-day working [of the WFI - the Oversight Committee] but it was still being run by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and his people, so we are not focusing on this. We are also not focused on the elections... our fight is to ensure FIR is filed on the complaints of sexual harassment made against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and that he is arrested, we want the police to investigate this thoroughly and the honourable court to provide us justice.

She added, ""We want the findings of the committee on the sexual harassment complaints made by the wrestlers. If they have not found anything then FIR should be filed on us. If they do find, FIR should filed on Brij Bhushan.""

Once they...",None,"Who Is BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, at the Heart of Serious Charges By Wrestlers?","New Delhi: “I have committed a murder in the past. Let people say what they want…I did commit a murder.”

This is not the confession of a convicted criminal, but a bold declaration made by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a BJP leader and six-time Lok Sabha MP who has never been tried for murder.

Though tales of the muscle power wielded by Singh, the MP from the Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh, are well-known, especially in Gonda and its surrounding districts, it is likely that no one knew that Singh had committed a murder until an interview he gave to a web portal in 2022. His affidavit submitted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections did mention four criminal cases, including one under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 307 (attempt to murder) and other serious crimes.

Singh has also been the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) since 2011, and there are allegations that he often resorts to the use of muscle power in running the federation. As a result of his tyrannical attitude, Olympic-level wrestlers were forced to hold a protest against him, staging a dharna at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar from January 18.

The protestors made serious allegations against Singh, including sexual harassment of women wrestlers, physical abuse, dictatorial functioning and financial irregularities in the management of WFI. The players called off the protest after a late-night meeting with sports minister Anurag Thakur on January 20, in which they were given an assurance that Singh would be relieved of his duties as WFI president and an inquiry committee would be set up.

Now, saying that they have lost faith in the committee, the wrestlers are back on protest. They have filed a police complaint against Singh, which also includes allegations of sexual assault on a minor. However, the police are yet to register an FIR – and the protesting wrestlers have said they will not leave Jantar Mantar until an FIR is filed. They have even approached the Supreme Court on the matter.

Meanwhile, regarding the allegations levelled against him, Singh claimed that he would hang himself if the charges were found to be true. He refused to resign from his post as president, calling the allegations politically motivated and terming it a Congress-sponsored protest. He even warned that if he opened his mouth, it would bring a ‘tsunami’. He compared the wrestlers’ protest with the Shaheen Bagh protest and added that a few players whose careers are over are levelling allegations against him.

However, Singh, who calls the protesting sportspersons as pawns of the Congress, does not have a slate as clean as he pretends. While he himself proclaimed on camera that he has committed a murder, on another occasion he reportedly confessed that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had held him responsible for “another murder”.

The many crimes of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh

Ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Scroll had quoted senior journalists from Gonda district as saying that Singh’s involvement in crime in the 1980s ranged from motorcycle/bike theft to running liquor shops. He even used to get boys to hunt for coins lying at the bottom of temple ponds. Soon he became a civil contractor. Vinod Kumar Singh alias Pandit Singh, a former minister in the Samajwadi Party cabinet in UP, was his associate in all these activities.

Later, Brij Bhushan and Pandit Singh turned from friends to foes and in 1993 Brij Bhushan was charged under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (spreading nuisance), 148 (possessing deadly weapon) and 149 (offence committed by every member of an unlawful assembly with common object) for shooting at Pandit Singh. Pandit Singh had claimed in an interview to Scroll that 20 bullets were fired at him and he was hospitalised for 14 months.

In the case which lasted for 29 years, Brij Bhushan was acquitted in December last year due to the lack of evidence. However, the court pulled up the investigators, saying that during the investigation no effort was made to collect evidence and even the weapon used in the crime could not be recovered.

In his defence, Brij Bhushan had argued that he was in Delhi at the time of the attack. In response, the judge said that no effort was made by the investigators to verify this claim, which makes the entire investigation questionable.

Pandit Singh, the victim in the case, died in May 2021 after contracting COVID-19 about a year and a half before the verdict. One of the reasons for Brij Bhushan’s acquittal in this case was that Pandit Singh did not appear to record a statement against him. When asked why in an interview in 2014, the latter replied, “If I decide to testify against Brij Bhushan in the 1993 firing case, I can get him behind bars. But I have restrained myself from doing so because I want to keep him alive. It is fun to fight with a strong person. You stay alert and don’t make mistakes.”

‘… I did commit a murder’

Pandit Singh had a brother, Ravinder Singh, who was a very close friend of Brij Bhushan’s. Both of them were contractors and used to work together. Once they had gone to hold a panchayat meeting where shots were fired in the air and one bullet hit Ravinder while he was standing next to Brij Bhushan. It enraged Bhushan so much that he snatched the rifle from the hands of the person who had fired the shot and shot him. The person died on the spot.

This incident was narrated by Brij Bhushan himself in an interview to the online portal Lallantop. In the interview, he said, “I have committed a murder in the past. Whatever people may say, I did commit a murder. I immediately shot and killed the person who had shot Ravinder dead.”

He further said in the interview that Lallu Singh, who is currently the BJP MP from the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat in Ayodhya district, is a witness to the incident.

He added that some time after the incident, he was sent to jail under the Gangster Act by veteran leader and former minister of Gonda, Kunwar Anand Singh.

Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had also suspected Bhushan of committing another murder, the latter confessed. After the death of the BJP candidate of Gonda Lok Sabha seat, the former prime minister had said, “(You) got him killed.”

Brij Bhushan is a six-time MP, winning five times on a BJP ticket and once (in 2009) on an SP ticket. He won the first two elections in 1991 and 1999 from the Gonda Lok Sabha seat. In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP gave him a ticket from Balrampur and nominated Ghanshyam Shukla from Gonda. Shukla died in a road accident on the day of polling.

Recalling it in a conversation with Scroll, Brij Bhushan said, “My opponents spread rumours that it was not an accident but a murder. Atal ji called me and said,‘Marwa diya (You got him killed).’”

Brij Bhushan added that this led to his differences with the BJP. As a result, he made headlines by cross-voting against his own party in a crucial confidence motion by the opposition against the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2008. The BJP expelled him, but the SP opened its doors for him.

He was elected MP from Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat in 2009 on an SP ticket. In 2014, he rejoined the BJP and again became an MP from Kaiserganj, repeating his victory in 2019 as well.

It is noteworthy that he remained in the BJP even after the then prime minister had expressed his suspicion of that Bhushan had murdered a BJP candidate. The BJP expelled him only after his cross-vote.

However, Brij Bhushan’s political clout remained unaffected. Despite his confession of having committed a murder and being accused of another murder by the then PM, both the BJP and the opposition SP embraced him and covered up his crimes as he continued to get tickets and win election after election. For more than a decade, he has been the president of a national sports association.

According to the Indian Express, he likes to be referred to as ‘powerful’ and believes that he doesn’t need the BJP as much as the BJP needs him. In his home district of Gonda in Uttar Pradesh and at least half a dozen adjoining districts, he wields a lot of influence.

A local BJP leader from Gonda told the newspaper, “Brij Bhushan only borrows the party symbol, he doesn’t need it to win the election. He wins them on his own.”

He has more than 50 educational institutions running in Bahraich, Gonda, Balrampur, Ayodhya and Shravasti districts of UP which is also a source of his political domination in the region, something he admits.

He said, “I did not establish them (college) with any political motive, but today boys rally around me. People may call me mafia, but my students idolise me. Earlier I used to touch the feet of Brahmins, today young Brahmins touch my feet calling me Guruji.”

This is the reason why Brij Bhushan, who maintains a stature bigger than the party in the region, challenges his own party and its decisions with hardly any adverse consequences.

In October last year, while targeting the BJP government in UP, he said that he had never seen such poor management of floods and that people are at God’s mercy. On a question asked regarding chief minister Adityanath, he said, “Don’t make me say anything.”

In addition, he even praised SP leader Azam Khan, the biggest thorn in the BJP’s side in UP, by calling him a ‘leader of the people’.

In June last year, when Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray expressed his desire to visit Ayodhya, Brij Bhushan went against the party line and opposed Thackeray’s visit at a time when the BJP was considering MNS as an ally during a tumultuous phase of Maharashtrian politics.

“I will not allow Raj Thackeray, who insulted North Indians, to enter Ayodhya until he apologises to all North Indians with folded hands,” he claimed. “I request chief minister Yogi Adityanath to not meet him. The RSS, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the common man played a role in the Ram Mandir movement. The Thackeray family has nothing to do with it.”

He also launched a tirade against yoga guru and businessman Ramdev, accusing his company Patanjali of selling spurious ghee and warned him of a nationwide agitation against Patanjali’s products, terming him the ‘king of adulteration‘. He also called upon the Sant community to stand against Ramdev and appealed to the Centre as well as the UP and Uttarakhand governments to take action against the latter.

Brij Bhushan Singh’s image of a staunch Hindutva leader also corresponds with the political ideology of the BJP. His controversial remarks, for instance, about the ancestors of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, calling them Hindu, only help the BJP’s cause. This is perhaps why his defiance against the party is largely ignored by the top brass.

Brij Bhushan’s long tryst with controversies

Brij Bhushan joined the BJP in the late 1990s having studied law at the Awadh University. It was the era of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and he caught the BJP’s eye because of his good standing in the areas around Ayodhya. Today, his wife Ketki Devi Singh is the Gonda District Panchayat President while his son Prateek Bhushan Singh is the MLA from Gonda Sadar seat.

Brij Bhushan was one of the prominent faces of the Ram Mandir movement and was also arrested along with senior BJP leader L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and former chief minister Kalyan Singh in the Babri demolition case in which he was the main accused. In 2020, the court acquitted all the accused including Brij Bhushan.

In an attempt to cash in on his image as a staunch Hindutva leader, he boasts, “During the movement, I was the first person from the area to be arrested by Mulayam Singh. I was also the first person arrested by the CBI after the controversial structure was demolished.”

In the mid-1990s, his relationship with the underworld also came to the fore. He spent several months in Tihar Jail on charges of harbouring members of the Dawood Ibrahim gang. A case was registered against him under the Terrorist and Divisive Activities Prevention Act (TADA). He was later acquitted due to the lack of evidence.

While he was in jail, his wife contested on the BJP ticket from Gonda Lok Sabha seat and won.

In 2004, Brij Bhushan’s 22-year-old son Shakti Singh died by suicide, leaving a suicide note in which he blamed his father Brij Bhushan for the act. “You could not prove to be a good father. You did not take care of my siblings and me. You always thought about yourself and did not care about us. We see our future in darkness. That’s why there is no point in living now,” the note read.

Tyrannical attitude as wrestling federation head

In managing the WFI, Brij Bhushan has often been accused of being a self-centred narcissist, which is also reflected in his remarks. For instance, he reportedly said in an interview to the Indian Express in 2021, “They (wrestlers) are strong boys and girls. You need someone strong to control them. Is there anyone stronger than me here?”

The report stated how his is the final word in every matter related to wrestling in the federation. He keeps an eye on every minor and major wrestling tournament and often gives instructions to the referee and even punishes the judges.

Referring to a few standout anecdotes about his dictatorial attitude, the report said that he suspended a railway coach during a national championship in Noida in January 2021. He asked the referee to penalise a wrestler from Delhi because the wrestler’s supporters had entered the playing arena. The referee said there was no such rule but Singh insisted upon it.

If he is unable to be physically present at a tournament, he monitors it from home by getting cameras installed everywhere at the venue, something he himself admitted.

The report further added that the wrestlers are well aware of Brij Bhushan’s attitude. Therefore, when they lose in a controversial match, instead of going to the judge, they appeal directly to him.

Meanwhile, scenes of wrestlers bowing before Brij Bhushan and seeking blessings from him are also common during the matches of the national championship in Indian wrestling.

His influence is such that he recently lashed out at the Union government’s ‘Target Olympic Podium (TOP)’ scheme for the preparation of athletes for Olympics, and asked the government not to directly approach the athletes under this scheme.

Meanwhile, after the Tokyo Olympics last year, he had said that the federation would keep an eye on private, non-profit organisations supporting wrestlers.

Speaking to The Print, a former Sports Authority of India coach said, “Brij Bhushan is the goon that wrestling needs. Without him, it would be very difficult to discipline or keep wrestlers under control.”

His hooliganism was witnessed in 2021 during a junior level wrestling tournament in Ranchi, when he started hitting a wrestler on stage.

Dronacharya awardee Mahavir Phogat had also told the media in detail about Singh’s attitude in running the federation and claimed that apart from interfering with the diet of the wrestlers, he also takes half of the sponsorship money they receive.

New Delhi, April 26

Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat have once again alleged that Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s people are threatening the complainants. The wrestlers claimed that Singh’s people have found out the address of the minor girl who is one of the seven wrestlers that have filed a complaint of sexual harassment against Singh.

The wrestlers were seen training at the protest site on Wednesday. PTI

“Brij Bhushan is claiming innocence while he is threatening the minor girl,” Bajrang said. “Not many here know her name but people have reached her house. If he is innocent then why is he resorting to such acts?” he added.

Bajrang added that the same people are pressuring her relatives to withdraw the complaint. He also alleged that two persons tried to scare him off the case as well.

“Today, two persons approached me and warned me, asking why I was picking up a fight with him. They told me ‘once his party did not give him the ticket, the one who got the ticket was killed the day of the voting’. They are trying to scare us but we have the support of the country. We are not scared,” he said.

As the police were still reluctant to lodge an FIR against Singh, the wrestlers carried out a candlelight procession.

The wrestlers also tried training near the dharna site, though no sparring sessions could take place as the Delhi Police did not allow them to get the mats to the dharna site.

“We trained for a bit in the morning,” Bajrang said. “We had brought the mats but the police did not allow us to place them here. When we were training on the roads, they said you can’t train as we did not have the permission. They do the same thing when we are trying to get food and water. Do we need to take permission to breathe, eat and train?” he added.

“When it comes to medals, everybody joins in and says our wrestlers have made us proud and now that we are out on the road, can’t they see our troubles. We should be in stadiums training, not sitting here. We are very hurt by all of this,” he added.

Listen to our Mann ki Baat

Sakshi and Vinesh urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani to hear the wrestler’s “mann ki baat”.

“PM Modi sir says beti bachao, beti padhao. He listens to everyone’s mann ki baat and I want to ask him whether he is listening to us at all. You call us at your house and give us respect so I request you to please listen to our mann ki baat as well,” Sakshi said.

“I also want to ask Smriti Irani ji, why have you not said anything in our matter? We have been sitting here for the last four days, suffering from mosquito bites. The Delhi Police are not allowing us food. They are not allowing us to train, why are you mum? Please come and support us,” the Rio bronze medallist added.

Vinesh questioned why the PM did not reach out to them. “Who knows our voices may not be reaching him. We do not have his direct number where we can contact him. All we can do is to request a meeting through the media,” Vinesh said. “We have been saying that we wanted to meet him from the start. We have taken a huge risk with our careers for this big fight,” she added.

‘Deeply concerning’

New Delhi: Olympics champion shooter Abhinav Bindra took to social media to announce his solidarity with the protesting wrestlers. Bindra has always voiced his opinion in favour of distressed sportspersons. “As athletes, we train hard every day to represent our country on the international stage. It is deeply concerning to see our athletes finding it necessary to protest on the streets regarding the allegations of harassment in the Indian wrestling administration,” Bindra tweeted. Bindra said that all the concerns raised by top wrestlers should be addressed by the administration. “My heart goes out to all those who have been affected. We must ensure that this issue is handled properly, with the athletes’ concerns heard and addressed fairly and independently. This incident highlights the crucial need for a proper safeguarding mechanism that can prevent harassment and ensure justice for those affected,” he said. pti

On the third day of the protest, two-time World Championship medallist Vinesh Phogat said threats were being made to ‘break the resolve’ of the complainants. Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia accused Singh’s coterie of threatening the family of the minor, one of the seven complainants.

“They are trying to threaten the minor victim and pressure is being put on the family members to withdraw the complaint. We have learned that one of the people threatening them is a coach who is a Dronacharya-award winner and the other is the secretary of the Haryana Wrestling Association. They went to her house and are putting pressure on the family and also offered money. They want her to take the complaint back. Those women wrestlers who have filed complaints against the WFI president are being threatened too,” Bajrang said at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday.

The complaints were filed on Friday at the Connaught Place Police Station in New Delhi, and it is learnt that the wrestlers have cited multiple instances of sexual harassment, dating back to 2012 and as recent as 2022.

What is unfortunate, Vinesh said, is that the names of the victims who registered the complaints at the police station seem to have been leaked to the WFI president.

“If a girl makes a complaint of sexual harassment, what should the police do? There needs to be an FIR, an arrest should be made under POCSO (The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act). But why have the police not done these basic things so far? And now the complainants are being threatened and being asked to withdraw the case,” Vinesh said.

Unlike in January when they sat in protest till dusk and returned the next morning, this time the wrestlers, including Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik, are spending the night at Jantar Mantar. The protesting wrestlers have said they have lost faith in the Oversight Committee set up by the sports ministry to probe the allegations of sexual harassment against the WFI president.

The report of the Oversight Committee headed by boxing legend Mary Kom has not been made public despite the one-month deadline expiring by the end of February.

The government on Monday shared the ‘major findings’ of the Oversight Committee but remained silent on the charges against the WFI president.

In a letter to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president and former sprint queen PT Usha, the sports ministry mentioned only the structural lapses within the WFI, including the absence of an Internal Complaints Committee, and called for “effective communication between the Federation and the sportspersons”. The ministry also declared the ongoing process for the WFI elections, scheduled to take place on May 7, as null and void, and directed the IOA to form an ad-hoc committee.

No going back

“Hamare saath game ho gaya (We were fooled the last time). We believed we would get justice and that is why we ended the protest after three days. But this time, we won’t get swayed by false promises. Till the investigation is taken to its conclusion, and arrests are made based on the complaints, we will not stop protesting. We have faith in the Supreme Court,” Vinesh said.

The wrestlers made it clear that just filing an FIR against the accused was not enough.

“We won’t end our protest when an FIR is lodged. He (the WFI president) has to be arrested and put behind bars. So many people roam around freely despite an FIR being lodged against them. Will we be safe if he is free? And how will we train, if he is roaming free?” Vinesh said between meeting politicians from different parties, members of farmer unions and khap leaders.

The wrestlers had sought the support of political parties and women’s organisations on Monday in a departure from their earlier stand. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Communist Party of India leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Brinda Karat and Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Reena Gupta were among those who met the wrestlers on Tuesday.

“The question is why those athletes, who should have been at a stadium, are being forced to sit in protest at Jantar Mantar. There needs to be a thorough investigation into the matter. The athletes need to get justice and my full support is with them,” Hooda tweeted.

Local leaders from Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, who were involved in the farmer protests, also came forward with the promise of hundreds of supporters travelling to Jantar Mantar over the next few days.

“Earlier (in January), we didn’t want the people from political parties to come to the protest site because then people would say we are trying to play politics. But after that, we were fooled. We have asked everyone to come, including politicians, farmers and khap leaders because people want to support us and are fighting for the self-respect and dignity of women wrestlers. This is not about Uttar Pradesh versus Haryana. The UP-Haryana story is being spread by those who want us to fail and those who are close to Brijbhushan Sharan Singh,” Vinesh said.

(FILE)

Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on Tuesday did not directly reply to questions over protesting wrestlers' allegations against him and said the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.

Some prominent wrestlers, who have resumed their protest seeking registration of criminal case on their allegations against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, moved the Supreme Court on Monday.

""The matter is in the Supreme Court and the court will decide,"" Brij Bhushan Singh told media persons.

The wrestlers said they had resumed the protest as ""no action has been taken in the matter"".

Ace India wrestler Sakshi Malik broke down while interacting with the media as wrestlers protested at Jantar Mantar.

Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia are among those who have resumed their protest over their demands.

""We wanted to file a sexual harassment FIR against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Two days ago we got a complaint filed but FIR hasn't been registered yet. There are seven female wrestlers and one of them is a minor. We want the investigation to happen fast. It is a sensitive matter. We are being framed as liars which we cannot bear. We are waiting for two-and-a-half months now but no one is listening. People are saying we are spent force that is why we are protesting. We just won a medal at CWG 2022,"" Sakshi Malik told the media at Jantar Mantar.

""It is being heard that we are finished, that's why we are protesting. For two and a half months the government has not taken any action. We cannot reveal the name of a minor,"" she added.

Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Ravi Dahiya, and Sakshi Malik, held a sit-in protest in Jantar Mantar in January this year, demanding that Brij Bhushan be removed from and Wrestling Federation of India be disbanded. They had accused the body and its chief of sexual harassment and mistreatment of wrestlers.

Following the protest, the Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports had announced the formation of an 'oversight committee' to probe the allegations.

Olympic medalist Mary Kom is heading the Oversight Committee. Former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former shuttler Trupti Murgunde, SAI member Radhica Sreeman, ex-CEO of the Target Olympic Podium Plan Rajesh Rajagopalan, and CWG gold medalist Babita Phogat are the other members of the Mary Kom-led committee.

Decorated wrestlers Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia and Sakshi malik are the three central characters in the renewed protests against Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation by the grapplers.

LENDING WEIGHT to the sexual harassment charges against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a physiotherapist who was present at the national camp in Lucknow in 2014 has said that at least three junior women wrestlers at the camp told him how they faced “pressure” and were “asked to meet Brij Bhushan at night”. Speaking to The Indian Express at the wrestlers’ protest in Jantar Mantar, the physiotherapist, Paramjeet Malik, said the girls had cried while confiding in their seniors about their ordeal. Paramjeet said he had shared the information with the then women’s coach, Kuldeep Malik, but no action was taken. In the past, Brij Bhushan has consistently denied the allegations and said they are part of a plot against him.

Akali stalwart Parkash Singh Badal was cremated with full state honours at his ancestral village in Punjab's Muktsar district with thousands of mourners and leaders across the political spectrum paying their last respects to the five-time chief minister. Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal lit the funeral pyre at a special platform erected for the last rites as a Punjab Police contingent accorded a gun salute. Wrapped in the Tricolour, Badal's mortal remains were taken to the family's farmland, around a kilometer from his residence where it was kept for people to have the last 'darshan' with his son Sukhbir Singh Badal and other family members standing with folded hands on it.

A man died in Kaliaganj in West Bengal’s North Dinajpur, allegedly of a bullet injury, early Thursday morning, sparking a fresh war of words between the BJP and the ruling TMC. The village has been on edge ever since a 17-year-old girl died last week, and her family alleged she had been raped. Since then, protesters have clashed with police on two occasions, including on Tuesday when 17 personnel were injured and the local police station set on fire. While officers are yet to comment on 33-year-old Mrityunjay Burman’s death, the BJP has alleged he was killed by the police.

As campaigning heats up with the Karnataka polls round the corner, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, while addressing a rally in Kalaburagi, compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a “poisonous snake”. “Understand this correctly… Modi like a poisonous snake. Do not taste to test if it is poison or not… If you taste it, you are dead. You may think that it is not poison because a good man like Modi gave it to you… but if you taste you’ll lie dead on the ground,” the Congress chief said. Kharge later issued a clarification when asked about the comment. “It wasn’t meant for PM Modi. What I meant was that the BJP’s ideology is “like a snake”.

Borivali-based actor Chrisann Pereira, 27, who was lodged in a Sharjah prison in the United Arab Emirates after she was framed in a drug case, in a letter recounted the harrowing time she went through. She said that during her 26 days in jail, she washed her hair with laundry detergent powder Tide and made coffee using toilet water. The actor was released on Wednesday evening and is expected to reach India soon. ""I watched Bollywood movies, sometimes with tears in my eyes knowing my ambition brought me here. I sometimes smile at our culture, our movies and the familiar faces on TV,"" the letter read.

In other news: the Vigilance department issued a show cause notice to 2007 batch IAS (AGMUT cadre) officer Udit Prakash Rai for allegedly demolishing a monument in Delhi — a “Pathan period” Mahal dating back to 1418 when the Sayyid dynasty ruled Delhi – and for building a new government accommodation in its place to move in as the then CEO of the Delhi Jal Board. The monument that disappeared – only a gateway still stands – is in South East Delhi’s Jal Vihar near Lajpat Nagar. It finds mention in the ASI’s List of Muhammadan and Hindu monuments, Vol. IV and is called Mahal.

The Delhi High Court set aside the order issued by Delhi University which had debarred a PhD scholar for a year for his alleged involvement in the disturbance of law and order in the varsity during the screening of the BBC documentary, India: The Modi Question, in January. A single judge bench of Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav said the action taken against the PhD scholar and NSUI National Secretary Lokesh Chugh was made in violation of principles of natural justice and ”reasons are necessary to be assigned by the administrative authority” in the order.

Lastly: Fighting intensified in Sudan’s war-ravaged province of Darfur during a fragile three-day truce between the country’s battling top generals, killing an estimated dozens of people, residents said. The truce eased fighting in the country’s capital, creating a lull that allowed foreign governments to evacuate thousands of their nationals.

🔴 Five-time Chief Minister of Punjab, Sardar Parkash Singh Badal, is no more. With this the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) has lost its architect, and the state its great reconciler, a leader who believed in building bridges with disparate ideologies, to keep it on the path of peace.

🔴 Badal spent much of his life in contest with the Congress. There is a history to it: while he was seen as a “secular” voice among the Akalis, his secularism was severely tested when the Army entered Golden Temple as part of Operation Blue Star to capture Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. He never forgave the Congress for this. He was accused of calling Sikh soldiers to mutiny from the Indian Army over Operation Blue Star and was jailed for sedition.

🔴 Badal passed away on a day the SIT probing cases of sacrilege and the Kotkapura police firing, filed a 2,400-page supplementary chargesheet against him, the then home minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and five others. This was one case that continued to haunt Badal.

That may be changing.”

A statement from Pranav Tayal, Deputy Commissioner of Police, confirmed that two FIRs were registered in the police station in Connaught Place, New Delhi District, which was where the wrestlers had filed a complaint eight days ago.

""The first one pertains to allegations levelled by a minor victim which is registered under POCSO Act along with relevant IPC sections concerning outraging of modesty etc. The second FIR is registered for carrying out comprehensive investigations into the complaints tendered by other, adult complainants under relevant sections pertaining to outraging of modesty etc.,"" said Tayal.

The decision come hours after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta announced in the Supreme Court on Friday morning that Delhi Police had agreed to register an FIR against Brij Bhushan. A bench headed by the Chief Justice was hearing a petition filed by the wrestlers earlier today.

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the wrestlers, has also asked the court to guarantee police security to a minor, who's one of the complainants. Chief Justice DY Chandrachud told the Delhi Police to make an 'adequate assessment of threat perception and provide security'. The matter will be heard again in the court after one week.

The move comes after country's top wrestlers led by Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, and Worlds medallist Vinesh Phogat moved the Supreme Court with a petition seeking registration of an FIR against Singh.

The wrestlers, who resumed their protest on April 23, after starting it back in January, said they had raised a complaint at Connaught Place police station (in New Delhi) against Singh, but the police had refused to file an FIR.

On Thursday, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) set up a three-member ad-hoc committee to handle the day-to-day affairs of the WFI on the directions of the sports ministry. The ad-hoc committee comprises Suma Shirur, Bhupendra Singh Bajwa and a retired High Court judge, who will be named in the coming days. The committee will conduct the WFI elections within 45 days starting from Thursday.

Reacting to the protest by the wrestlers, the IOA president PT Usha said the wrestlers should have shown discipline and not taken their protest to the streets.

Thoda toh discipline hona chahiye (there should be some discipline),"" she said after a meeting of the IOA's Executive Committee. ""Instead of coming to us they have gone straight to the streets. It's not good for sport. Our feeling is that for sexual harassment complaints, IOA has a committee and athletes' commission. Instead of going to the street (again), they should have come to us, but they have not at all come to IOA.""

However, Usha's comments were inaccurate as the IOA had formed a seven-member committee on January 20, led by Mary Kom, to investigate the wrestlers' claims when the protests had first begun. This committee was overshadowed when the sports ministry announced its own committee.

Responding to Usha's comments, Bajrang Punia, the Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist and one of the protesting wrestlers, said: ""She herself was an athlete and she is also a woman. We did not expect this harsh reaction from her, we expected support.""

The wrestlers had earlier appealed directly to prime minister Narendra Modi and the minister in his cabinet in charge of women's affairs.

""PM Modi sir talks about 'Beti Bachao' and 'BetiPadhao', and listens to everyone's 'Mann Ki Baat'. Can't he listen to our 'mann ki baat'?"", Rio Games bronze medallist Sakshi Malik asked in a media interaction with PTI. ""He invites us to his home when we win medals and gives us a lot of respect and calls us his daughters. Today, we appeal to him that he listens to our 'Mann Ki Baat'.""","The Delhi Police, late on Friday evening, registered two FIRs against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president and BJP MP, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexually harassing seven women wrestlers, including one charge relating to sexual offences against a minor.

Facing allegations of sexual harassment by seven women wrestlers, Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on April 29 said he is ready for ""any kind of investigation"" but won't resign from his post as it would mean he has accepted the charges against him.

""I am completely innocent and have full faith in Supreme Court and Delhi Police. I am ready to face any kind of investigation,"" Mr. Singh told reporters at his residence in Bishnoharpur, about 40 km from Gonda city. ""Resigning as president of Wrestling Federation of India is not a big deal for me, but I will not resign as a criminal.""

Taking a strong exception to Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's meeting with the wrestlers on April 29 morning, Mr. Singh said, ""Today it has been seen who is behind this controversy. I have been saying from the beginning that an industrialist and the Congress have a hand in this. They are upset with me."" He, however, did not elaborate.

Priyanka Gandhi visited the wrestlers at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi and expressed solidarity with them, accusing the government of ""protecting"" the WFI chief.

Several wrestlers have resumed their agitation and sat on a dharna since April 23, demanding that an FIR be filed against the ""Gonda strongman"". They also demand that Mr. Singh be removed from from all posts he holds. The Congress has said that he should be arrested immediately.

On Friday night, Delhi Police registered two FIRs against Singh. While the first FIR pertained to allegations of a minor wrestler and was registered under the POCSO Act, the second was related to outraging modesty.

""I'm not a criminal. Resigning means I have accepted their allegations,"" Mr. Singh, the BJP MP from Kaiserganj in Uttar Pradesh, said. He claimed all the demands of women wrestlers have been accepted.

""An FIR has been lodged against me, yet they are sitting on dharna. Why?"" he asked.

Mr. Singh, a sixth-term lawmaker, said his tenure as the WFI chief is complete and he will automatically resign with the election of the new president. He is only playing the role of a ""caretaker"" till the election.

Mr. Singh has completed 12 years as WFI chief and is ineligible to contest for another term.

He asked why are the wrestlers still sitting on dharna now when an FIR has been registered against him. ""Why are they constantly speaking against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Sports Ministry?""

Mr. Singh said the ongoing dharna by the wrestlers is not a protest of sportspersons but a protest of the ""conspirators"". ""They did not wait for the investigation report to be made public and went to the Supreme Court and there raised a new allegation. They are saying that the sport has to be saved but they are not saving the game [by doing this]. They have caused a huge loss in the last four months,"" he said.

He also asked if he had been sexually abusing players for 12 years, why they never took a complaint to the police station, federation or the government till date. ""They went straight to Jantar Mantar,"" he said.

Mr. Singh said he has submitted an audio clip to the probe committee, in which a man is heard speaking about arranging a girl to implicate him.

Stressing that he fully respects the decision of the Supreme Court and the government, Mr. Singh alleged the protestors are coming up with new demands everyday.

""First they demanded an FIR and now that the FIR has been lodged, they are demanding to put me in jail. I am a member of the Lok Sabha,"" Mr. Singh said.

Claiming that the entire Haryana and U.P. ""akhadas"" are with him, the MP said it is only ""one family's akhada"" which is against him.

""I have full faith in the law of the land. I will definitely be proved innocent. It has been troubling me for a long time. I and my family are being abused. Our supporters are also being targeted but my supporters and family have full faith that I am innocent. Soon, the country will also come to know about it,"" he added.","I am ready to face any kind of investigation,"" Mr. Singh told reporters at his residence in Bishnoharpur, about 40 km from Gonda city.

Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh(ANI )

Addressing the media at his residence in Bishnoharpur, near Gonda, the sixth-term BJP MP from UP's Kaiserganj said: “I am completely innocent and have full faith in Supreme Court and Delhi Police. I am ready to face any kind of investigation. Resigning as president of the Wrestling Federation of India is not a big deal for me, but I will not resign as a criminal. If I resign, it would mean that I have accepted their allegations.”

The Delhi Police have registered two FIRs, including one under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act as one of the seven complainants is a juvenile. The FIRs were registered on Friday after the wrestlers, who resumed their sit-in at Jantar Mantar last Sunday, petitioned the Supreme Court.

Singh said the wrestlers were moving the goalposts. “Every day they are coming up with new demands. They wanted an FIR and that has been done. Now they are saying I should be sent to jail and resign from all posts.”

“I am an MP because of the people of my constituency and not because of Vinesh Phogat. Only one family and akhara are protesting. Why aren’t people from any other place complaining?”

One FIR was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 354 (molestation), 354(A) (sexual harassment), 354(D) (stalking) and 34 (common intention), clubbing the complaints of the six adult wrestlers. The second FIR was based on the complaint of the juvenile wrestler, invoking Section 10 of the POCSO Act in addition to the four IPC sections from the first FIR, a police officer said. Section 34 means involvement of more than one person in the crime, though police did not say if anyone else has been accused by the complainants.

Police is likely to record the statements of the complainants from Sunday. Singh is yet to be served a notice asking him to appear before the investigating team and join the probe. “Of the seven complainants, some are on the sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar, where some politicians met them on Saturday. The juvenile wrestler is not there. The investigating team will meet each of them and record their statement,” an officer said.

“Along with the victims, we will also record statements of people who will be identified by them as witnesses to the sexual harassment. As the allegations date back to between 2012 and 2022, in and outside Delhi and abroad as well, it will be difficult for us to get any electronic evidence such as CCTV footage. We will ask the complainants to share with us any electronic evidence, such as sexually-coloured messages, if any, that they may have saved with them,” a second officer said.

The first official said at least one police officer has been deployed with each complainant.

Alleging conspiracy, Singh, 66, said, “I have audio of a male wrestler telling someone to arrange a victim. I have shared that audio recording with the oversight committee (of the union sports ministry). I won't resign till the charges against me aren't proved.”

He criticised Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi visiting the protesters on Saturday.

“Today, it became clear who is behind this controversy. I have been saying from the beginning that an industrialist and the Congress have a hand in this. They are upset with me.”

He claimed that the protesting wrestlers had tried to avoid the nationals by seeking exemption. Vinesh Phogat denied it. “Ever since I began competing in 2009, I have skipped only four nationals. I got injured during the Rio Games (2016), which was the first year. I skipped the nationals during Covid near Tokyo Games. I myself was down with Covid. The third national I skipped was after Tokyo because I was not in a good mental state after the defeat. I could have done anything to myself at that time (due to depression). The fourth I missed was this year. I had requested permission to skip the world championships trials because cutting weight thrice in a month is difficult. I have competed in 10 nationals and have not lost once.""

Tokyo Games bronze medallist Bajrang Punia said, ""This issue is not about nationals. This is about sexual harassment. He should answer those questions.""

There was a twitter spat between cousins Vinesh and wrestler-turned-BJP politician Babita Phogat. “Sportspersons are capable to fight their own battles. Their stage should not be used to claim brownie political points,"" Babita tweeted, referring to politicians visiting the protest site.

Vinesh tweeted in response, ""If you are not standing for the rights of aggrieved female wrestlers, Babita sister, I request you not to weaken our movement. It has taken years for female wrestlers to speak up against their abusers. You are also a woman, try to understand our pain.""

While pressure is growing on the BJP to take action against its Kaiserganj MP and Wrestling Federation of India president Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, over allegations of sexual exploitation and harassment of wrestlers, the party has held out for four months. And, it might not proceed against him in a hurry anytime soon.

Elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1991, the 66-year-old or his wife have been an MP from Uttar Pradesh almost ever since. In 1996, when Singh was denied a ticket after he was indicted in a TADA case for allegedly harbouring associates of Dawood Ibrahim, his wife Kektidevi Singh was fielded by the BJP from Gonda and won. In 1998, Singh suffered a rare poll loss, to the Samajwadi Party’s Kirtivardhan Singh, from Gonda.

Apart from his impressive poll influence, Singh wields clout via a chain of nearly 50 educational institutions run by him, spread across a 100-km belt from Ayodhya till Shravasti. In his wake, his relatives have also established such institutions, and local BJP sources say that Singh’s poll machinery is run almost entirely by this set-up, independent of the party.

They give the example of 2009, when Singh, sensing the dwindling fortunes of the BJP, switched to the SP, and won defeating a BJP candidate, from Kaiserganj. The 2009 elections at the Centre were won by the UPA, with the SP as an ally. Singh announced this decision during the nuclear deal debate in July 2008, at the time as a BJP MP.

Singh’s ties to the Sangh Parivar go back to before he joined the BJP. Considered close to the late VHP chief Ashok Singhal, Singh, who had studied at Ayodhya and was involved in student politics, was at the temple town when the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, 1992, and was booked along with others for “provoking” kar sevaks to demolish the structure. By then, Singh had already won his first election as a BJP candidate.","Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh's ties to the Sangh Parivar go back to before he joined the BJP (Facebook/Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh)While pressure is growing on the BJP to take action against its Kaiserganj MP and Wrestling Federation of India president Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, over allegations of sexual exploitation and harassment of wrestlers, the party has held out for four months.

Wrestling has been an Olympic sport since 1896. But wrestling in India traces its origin to the fifth century BCE. In Akbar's court, in the 16th century, there were many wrestlers. The Ain-i-Akbari contains references to Mirza Khan of Gilan (in Iran), Muhammad Quli of Tabriz (in Iran), Cadiq of Bukhara (in Uzbekistan), Murad of Turkistan (in Kazakhstan), Hilal of Abyssinia, Kanhya, Mangol, Ganesh, Bajmath. The role of akharas in India’s struggle for Independence is legendary. Men's wrestling is tied to ideas of machismo, physical prowess. There is also an entire narrative around wrestling, the disciplining of the body, mind, morals. There are scholarly pieces on how wrestlers model themselves on sannyasis or ascetics.

The Switch

Women's wrestling in its present-day avatar is said to have started in France in the 1960s-1970s and was rooted in the second feminist movement. This was when contraception was legalised, as was abortion. If men's wrestling is about celebrating the body, women's wrestling has been about using the body to channelise a spirit and to defy traditional perceptions. Women were wrestling in Norway in the early 1970s. Japan took to it in the late 1980s. In 2004, women's wrestling was added to the Olympic repertoire. In 1997, no sooner than the announcement was made, ace wrestler Chandgi Ram started training his two daughters --- Sonika and Deepika Kaliraman. In 2001, Sonika won the Bharat Kesri title, but a decade later when she levelled charges of sexual misdemeanour against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), the selection committee and the coaching staff, she found herself in a takedown like no other. Last week, after much grappling with lawkeepers, seven women wrestlers have finally managed to file two FIRs against WFI boss and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who they have accused of sexual harassment. Don't cheer yet, Singh is a wrestler before anything else. There would be wisdom in anticipating and preparing for a sprawl out.","And India's very own, the Great Khali, is known for his vice grip, wherein he crushes the cranium of his opponent.

I agree that funding has been good and facilities have improved, but the respect for athletes is the same (as before) in their eyes. When we get medals, they get photos clicked to show they are proud of us but the reality is quite different. And for women, it’s even more difficult.

Those involved in the system wonder how a woman can speak so much against the system. They aren’t happy when women talk against the system.

When other athletes raise their voices when it comes to trials etc, it’s okay.

But when women raise their voices, they are targeted first. They ask, how did we get so much courage to speak against the system.

They say something but in their heart there is something else, and they portray something totally different. How we were being treated earlier, it’s the same. There’s no change in that aspect.

Nihal Koshie: How difficult was it for the victims and you to take that step?

It was difficult to explain to the girls’ families, to explain to ourselves and those around us that we’ve started this fight and have to continue. We were scared too. We fear the police. The first day when we took all the girls and went to the police station with the complaints, we feared the police so much because we had not faced them before.

Yes, we do have family members in the police but we’ve never faced them in such a situation. We didn’t know how the cops talk at the police station, or how they behave.

#WATCH | ""I have not yet received the FIR copy. I will speak once I've received the FIR copy,"" says Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, President, Wrestling Federation of India on wrestlers' protest against him and FIRs registered by Delhi police pic.twitter.com/FvU1FxkI35 — ANI (@ANI) April 29, 2023

The ministry told us to give them time and they would file an FIR according to the results of their finding. They told us not to worry about anything and that they would do everything. Now we think that we should have filed an FIR at that time itself and not waited.

Actually, we didn’t have courage at the time to file an FIR because we were wondering what would happen, and whom would we have to explain to. Media also, sometimes, troubles the victim by asking questions about the incident and what proof do we have. The families are also scared, wondering what their children are talking about openly.

We got fired up and started this fight. We thought it was a mistake to take on the system. We could’ve just not bothered and been happy wrestling. I mean, I can compete for another four-five years. I’ll compete at the Paris Olympics for sure. The family is crazy for an Olympic medal. And just before that, we are protesting. So many situations have risen, but somewhere we have found the courage. The fire for justice doesn’t die.

We know that we will get support from somewhere. God is not stone-hearted to see us struggle and fight so much, and then make us suffer.

Nihal Koshie: What led you to file an FIR now?

To be honest, we didn’t plan to file the FIR. And those who we are against never expected us to file the FIR either. They thought that if we actually wanted to file an FIR, we would have filed it then. As female athletes, they knew the problem or perhaps were trying to ignore it on purpose. They took advantage of our situation. They knew we were scared and respected people.

After the FIR, it’s like telling people that we are truthful, we have done nothing wrong. It’s good to get so much support. We have fought for smaller things, not for such a big thing. I believe in god and that he has a plan for everything. We have fought so much and he’ll not let it go to waste. He’s in control of everything. His plans are executed through us.

Mihir Vasavda: You could’ve finished your career comfortably, gone to Olympics, Brij Bhushan’s tenure as president was also getting over. What was the thinking behind picking up this fight now?

Actually, at trials and competitions where Brij Bhushan used to be there, he would say things like, ‘I’ll be in wrestling for (another) 20 years’. We thought this is not going to stop if he continues for 20 years. So many wrestlers will come into the sport and he’ll still be around. In my family, too, girls are getting into wrestling, they will be a certain age but Brij Bhushan will still be around. We tolerated somehow, and got out of the situation with courage. But what if the new athletes don’t even reach that level where they’ll be heard? That was worrying, that he’s here for the long haul. He considers it his fiefdom and everyone will be crushed under his feet. He’ll do whatever he feels like.

Mihir Vasavda: How was it dealing with the Federation officials?

How do I explain this? Suppose I have to go late to the national camp; for that you have to call (assistant secretary Vinod) Tomar; Tomar will ask neta (Brij Bhushan), then I have to ask the chief coach. He will ask for an application even if nothing is in his hands. Then Tomar won’t pick up the call the next day. If he’s angry with me, he’ll issue a show cause notice.

If my family has to get a certificate signed for a cash award from the Haryana government, if I’m not around they won’t even sign and will demand the athlete comes herself. They’ll keep troubling for the smallest of things. They’ll act obnoxiously and threaten by using the neta’s name. The treatment was awful. Even a tea-seller there had this attitude that ‘who the hell are you? I am the boss’. Even the water boy had a lot of attitude.

The way any athlete would be treated when we were going for any competition, and the facilities given to us would be of zero quality. We would mail asking them to send us two days in advance or for a physio that we need desperately, or to give us a good coach. It’s not like we can wrestle till 50 years. Our career span is small. Half of it goes in gaining experience, and when we are experienced these people don’t support us. We would be more exhausted dealing with them rather than in training or competition. Athletes are of no value in their eyes.

Mihir Vasavda: You have made a lot of comments about the Federation, Sports Ministry and Sports Authority of India. If the solution is reached to your satisfaction, how easy or difficult will it be for you to make a return to top-level competitions?

That’s a difficult question. We are thinking about what the situation can be in the future. But now that we have put our hand in the lion’s mouth, why be afraid! If we don’t say anything, then too we will be targeted, and if we open our mouths, something bad will happen to us. So let’s say it and face the consequences.

We know that we will face tough times, even if we win this fight. Not just during our careers, even after that, attempts will be made to remove any trace of our name and achievements from the sporting world and the sports community. But why care about those people and their feelings who have never achieved anything. If I have won a medal, that is registered in history. They can’t erase it.

Shivani Naik: Wrestling has a culture of giving respect, of listening to and following everything that people in authority say. Was that culture misused?

When Brij Bhushan was new in wrestling, he used to respect any good and upcoming wrestler. But as he started getting a firm foothold, he began to show his true colours. If a few wrestlers were good friends and training well together, he would send his own people there to break their friendship. He used to practise divide-and-rule policy.

Most wrestlers come from Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra, and are big on respect. Brij Bhushan has taken undue advantage of that. I would also blame athletes, as we stayed silent for a long time and tolerated a lot. If we had drawn a line earlier, things wouldn’t have come to this. Athletes would have faced difficulty in drawing a line against the system. There is not one Brij Bhushan, but several. How can we fight against so many? But if we can successfully deal with one, that will be a big thing in itself.

Sandeep Dwivedi: Winning an Olympic or World Championship medal takes a lifetime of effort. But no upcoming athlete would know how to counter these other challenges. What will be your message to them?

The tough journey is appreciated only by an athlete and their family. The toughest sports are taken up by those from the lower-income level families, who are used to hardships and difficulties. They think that they don’t have anything and so have no option but to work hard. They don’t have a Plan B. They only know they have to go ahead.

The craze of wrestling and other sports is growing. Especially in Haryana, people sell off their land to fund this dream, to fund a youngster’s training, diet and participation in competitions. To ensure that they stay fit and healthy, parents even stay awake with them. They save money to accompany them to competitions. If they don’t have money, they borrow it thinking they will repay it in a few months. They put everything in it in the hope that if their child becomes a top athlete, they will get everything… money, prestige, social status.

Thinking about all this, we thought what will come out of this struggle, even if we are successful. What will be our future? We knew we would perish regardless of whether we fought or not. But we thought that if we fought and won, we could form something better. But if we didn’t fight, we would have had a regret in life that we didn’t even try.

Sandeep Dwivedi: What gives you the strength to keep going on?

We don’t know from where we are getting the strength. I don’t know if we are actually normal or we are acting to be normal. We have stopped feeling anything. We don’t even know where the path we have chosen will lead us, there are so many obstacles along the way. If we clear one hurdle, something else will come up.

But, yes, if all the athletes come together, if they gather the strength — that we have to fight — then no one can do anything to an athlete. Not just wrestlers, but every sportsperson.

The entire country worships cricket but not a single cricketer has spoken up. We aren’t saying you speak in our favour but at least put out a neutral message and say there should be justice for whichever party. This is what pains me.

Every sports federation has a problem and a lot of athletes are my friends as well. But there should be no pretensions. I go to their matches, they come for mine, we get a photo clicked together, congratulate one another upon winning a medal, put nice messages like ‘onwards and upwards’… Athletes need to get out of the social media bubble and express real-world emotions. They should look beyond their personal gains and ask their conscience… We are human. We will also quit the sport someday. We should leave a legacy outside sports, too.

Sriram Veera: You spoke about lack of support. Some might fear, ‘Oh this is a sensitive issue; how do we know what really happened, how can we get into this?’ What do you have to say to those people?

What do they think, will we do these things just to get exemption from trials or not take part in national championships? We don’t take these allegations lightly. They should have this common sense. If you can’t raise your voice against the system… If this was such a small issue then why would we fight this battle that’ll only lead to lifelong animosity?

Log kehte hai wrestlers ka dimaag ghutno mein hota hai (People say wrestlers are not intelligent). But I’ll say our dil (heart), dimaag (brain), everything is in the right place. Other athletes need to check where their brain is. Dil toh unke paas hai hi nahi (They don’t have a heart).

If we don’t deserve their support in these times of struggle then, god-willing, if we win a medal tomorrow — and we will work very hard for it — then don’t come to congratulate us; don’t say you had faith in our abilities because you didn’t, that’s why you are doubting us now.

Sriram Veera: Can you talk about your courage? Where does it spring from?

It’s my mother. Our relationship is stronger than the bond between friends. We share everything. She was about 32 when she became a widow. I feel sad thinking about it. She struggled for us. In that struggle, we didn’t even realise when we grew up. A single woman, she would be taunted by others, how they treated her. Before my father died, my mother didn’t even step out of the house; she didn’t even know what was the price of tomatoes. Suddenly, tragedy struck.

Then she suffered from cancer, and would go to Rohtak for chemotherapy. Totally illiterate, she didn’t even know where to sit, where to get off. No one supported her. We grew up seeing her struggle. If a single woman like that, illiterate, could fight the society on her own and made us big wrestlers, then we can do it too. If we don’t speak out today, then all the struggles of my mother would have gone to waste. I won medals, that’s all right, but if we win this battle, she will proudly say, ‘I gave birth to them’.

I am proud that my mother showed so much strength and character; I guess that’s in me as well. Even my father was like that. I am also like that. I speak straight and honestly, and say what I feel.

It’s been misunderstood. Some feel, ‘arre yeh toh moofatt hai’ (she’s outspoken), but what can I tell them. I speak my mind. What’s inside is what comes out. Take it or leave it, and go home (laughs).","We didn’t know how the cops talk at the police station, or how they behave.

A statement from Pranav Tayal, Deputy Commissioner of Police, confirmed that two FIRs were registered in the police station in Connaught Place, New Delhi District, which was where the wrestlers had filed a complaint eight days ago.

""The first one pertains to allegations levelled by a minor victim which is registered under POCSO Act along with relevant IPC sections concerning outraging of modesty etc. The second FIR is registered for carrying out comprehensive investigations into the complaints tendered by other, adult complainants under relevant sections pertaining to outraging of modesty etc.,"" said Tayal.

The decision come hours after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta announced in the Supreme Court on Friday morning that Delhi Police had agreed to register an FIR against Brij Bhushan. A bench headed by the Chief Justice was hearing a petition filed by the wrestlers earlier today.

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the wrestlers, has also asked the court to guarantee police security to a minor, who's one of the complainants. Chief Justice DY Chandrachud told the Delhi Police to make an 'adequate assessment of threat perception and provide security'. The matter will be heard again in the court after one week.

The move comes after country's top wrestlers led by Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, and Worlds medallist Vinesh Phogat moved the Supreme Court with a petition seeking registration of an FIR against Singh.

The wrestlers, who resumed their protest on April 23, after starting it back in January, said they had raised a complaint at Connaught Place police station (in New Delhi) against Singh, but the police had refused to file an FIR.

On Thursday, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) set up a three-member ad-hoc committee to handle the day-to-day affairs of the WFI on the directions of the sports ministry. The ad-hoc committee comprises Suma Shirur, Bhupendra Singh Bajwa and a retired High Court judge, who will be named in the coming days. The committee will conduct the WFI elections within 45 days starting from Thursday.

Reacting to the protest by the wrestlers, the IOA president PT Usha said the wrestlers should have shown discipline and not taken their protest to the streets.

Thoda toh discipline hona chahiye (there should be some discipline),"" she said after a meeting of the IOA's Executive Committee. ""Instead of coming to us they have gone straight to the streets. It's not good for sport. Our feeling is that for sexual harassment complaints, IOA has a committee and athletes' commission. Instead of going to the street (again), they should have come to us, but they have not at all come to IOA.""

However, Usha's comments were inaccurate as the IOA had formed a seven-member committee on January 20, led by Mary Kom, to investigate the wrestlers' claims when the protests had first begun. This committee was overshadowed when the sports ministry announced its own committee.

Responding to Usha's comments, Bajrang Punia, the Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist and one of the protesting wrestlers, said: ""She herself was an athlete and she is also a woman. We did not expect this harsh reaction from her, we expected support.""

The wrestlers had earlier appealed directly to prime minister Narendra Modi and the minister in his cabinet in charge of women's affairs.

""PM Modi sir talks about 'Beti Bachao' and 'BetiPadhao', and listens to everyone's 'Mann Ki Baat'. Can't he listen to our 'mann ki baat'?"", Rio Games bronze medallist Sakshi Malik asked in a media interaction with PTI. ""He invites us to his home when we win medals and gives us a lot of respect and calls us his daughters. Today, we appeal to him that he listens to our 'Mann Ki Baat'.""","The Delhi Police, late on Friday evening, registered two FIRs against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president and BJP MP, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexually harassing seven women wrestlers, including one charge relating to sexual offences against a minor.

Facing allegations of sexual harassment by seven women wrestlers, Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on April 29 said he is ready for ""any kind of investigation"" but won't resign from his post as it would mean he has accepted the charges against him.

""I am completely innocent and have full faith in Supreme Court and Delhi Police. I am ready to face any kind of investigation,"" Mr. Singh told reporters at his residence in Bishnoharpur, about 40 km from Gonda city. ""Resigning as president of Wrestling Federation of India is not a big deal for me, but I will not resign as a criminal.""

Taking a strong exception to Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's meeting with the wrestlers on April 29 morning, Mr. Singh said, ""Today it has been seen who is behind this controversy. I have been saying from the beginning that an industrialist and the Congress have a hand in this. They are upset with me."" He, however, did not elaborate.

Priyanka Gandhi visited the wrestlers at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi and expressed solidarity with them, accusing the government of ""protecting"" the WFI chief.

Several wrestlers have resumed their agitation and sat on a dharna since April 23, demanding that an FIR be filed against the ""Gonda strongman"". They also demand that Mr. Singh be removed from from all posts he holds. The Congress has said that he should be arrested immediately.

On Friday night, Delhi Police registered two FIRs against Singh. While the first FIR pertained to allegations of a minor wrestler and was registered under the POCSO Act, the second was related to outraging modesty.

""I'm not a criminal. Resigning means I have accepted their allegations,"" Mr. Singh, the BJP MP from Kaiserganj in Uttar Pradesh, said. He claimed all the demands of women wrestlers have been accepted.

""An FIR has been lodged against me, yet they are sitting on dharna. Why?"" he asked.

Mr. Singh, a sixth-term lawmaker, said his tenure as the WFI chief is complete and he will automatically resign with the election of the new president. He is only playing the role of a ""caretaker"" till the election.

Mr. Singh has completed 12 years as WFI chief and is ineligible to contest for another term.

He asked why are the wrestlers still sitting on dharna now when an FIR has been registered against him. ""Why are they constantly speaking against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Sports Ministry?""

Mr. Singh said the ongoing dharna by the wrestlers is not a protest of sportspersons but a protest of the ""conspirators"". ""They did not wait for the investigation report to be made public and went to the Supreme Court and there raised a new allegation. They are saying that the sport has to be saved but they are not saving the game [by doing this]. They have caused a huge loss in the last four months,"" he said.

He also asked if he had been sexually abusing players for 12 years, why they never took a complaint to the police station, federation or the government till date. ""They went straight to Jantar Mantar,"" he said.

Mr. Singh said he has submitted an audio clip to the probe committee, in which a man is heard speaking about arranging a girl to implicate him.

Stressing that he fully respects the decision of the Supreme Court and the government, Mr. Singh alleged the protestors are coming up with new demands everyday.

""First they demanded an FIR and now that the FIR has been lodged, they are demanding to put me in jail. I am a member of the Lok Sabha,"" Mr. Singh said.

Claiming that the entire Haryana and U.P. ""akhadas"" are with him, the MP said it is only ""one family's akhada"" which is against him.

""I have full faith in the law of the land. I will definitely be proved innocent. It has been troubling me for a long time. I and my family are being abused. Our supporters are also being targeted but my supporters and family have full faith that I am innocent. Soon, the country will also come to know about it,"" he added.","I am ready to face any kind of investigation,"" Mr. Singh told reporters at his residence in Bishnoharpur, about 40 km from Gonda city.

Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh(ANI )

Addressing the media at his residence in Bishnoharpur, near Gonda, the sixth-term BJP MP from UP's Kaiserganj said: “I am completely innocent and have full faith in Supreme Court and Delhi Police. I am ready to face any kind of investigation. Resigning as president of the Wrestling Federation of India is not a big deal for me, but I will not resign as a criminal. If I resign, it would mean that I have accepted their allegations.”

The Delhi Police have registered two FIRs, including one under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act as one of the seven complainants is a juvenile. The FIRs were registered on Friday after the wrestlers, who resumed their sit-in at Jantar Mantar last Sunday, petitioned the Supreme Court.

Singh said the wrestlers were moving the goalposts. “Every day they are coming up with new demands. They wanted an FIR and that has been done. Now they are saying I should be sent to jail and resign from all posts.”

“I am an MP because of the people of my constituency and not because of Vinesh Phogat. Only one family and akhara are protesting. Why aren’t people from any other place complaining?”

One FIR was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 354 (molestation), 354(A) (sexual harassment), 354(D) (stalking) and 34 (common intention), clubbing the complaints of the six adult wrestlers. The second FIR was based on the complaint of the juvenile wrestler, invoking Section 10 of the POCSO Act in addition to the four IPC sections from the first FIR, a police officer said. Section 34 means involvement of more than one person in the crime, though police did not say if anyone else has been accused by the complainants.

Police is likely to record the statements of the complainants from Sunday. Singh is yet to be served a notice asking him to appear before the investigating team and join the probe. “Of the seven complainants, some are on the sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar, where some politicians met them on Saturday. The juvenile wrestler is not there. The investigating team will meet each of them and record their statement,” an officer said.

“Along with the victims, we will also record statements of people who will be identified by them as witnesses to the sexual harassment. As the allegations date back to between 2012 and 2022, in and outside Delhi and abroad as well, it will be difficult for us to get any electronic evidence such as CCTV footage. We will ask the complainants to share with us any electronic evidence, such as sexually-coloured messages, if any, that they may have saved with them,” a second officer said.

The first official said at least one police officer has been deployed with each complainant.

Alleging conspiracy, Singh, 66, said, “I have audio of a male wrestler telling someone to arrange a victim. I have shared that audio recording with the oversight committee (of the union sports ministry). I won't resign till the charges against me aren't proved.”

He criticised Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi visiting the protesters on Saturday.

“Today, it became clear who is behind this controversy. I have been saying from the beginning that an industrialist and the Congress have a hand in this. They are upset with me.”

He claimed that the protesting wrestlers had tried to avoid the nationals by seeking exemption. Vinesh Phogat denied it. “Ever since I began competing in 2009, I have skipped only four nationals. I got injured during the Rio Games (2016), which was the first year. I skipped the nationals during Covid near Tokyo Games. I myself was down with Covid. The third national I skipped was after Tokyo because I was not in a good mental state after the defeat. I could have done anything to myself at that time (due to depression). The fourth I missed was this year. I had requested permission to skip the world championships trials because cutting weight thrice in a month is difficult. I have competed in 10 nationals and have not lost once.""

Tokyo Games bronze medallist Bajrang Punia said, ""This issue is not about nationals. This is about sexual harassment. He should answer those questions.""

There was a twitter spat between cousins Vinesh and wrestler-turned-BJP politician Babita Phogat. “Sportspersons are capable to fight their own battles. Their stage should not be used to claim brownie political points,"" Babita tweeted, referring to politicians visiting the protest site.

Vinesh tweeted in response, ""If you are not standing for the rights of aggrieved female wrestlers, Babita sister, I request you not to weaken our movement. It has taken years for female wrestlers to speak up against their abusers. You are also a woman, try to understand our pain.""

While pressure is growing on the BJP to take action against its Kaiserganj MP and Wrestling Federation of India president Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, over allegations of sexual exploitation and harassment of wrestlers, the party has held out for four months. And, it might not proceed against him in a hurry anytime soon.

Elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1991, the 66-year-old or his wife have been an MP from Uttar Pradesh almost ever since. In 1996, when Singh was denied a ticket after he was indicted in a TADA case for allegedly harbouring associates of Dawood Ibrahim, his wife Kektidevi Singh was fielded by the BJP from Gonda and won. In 1998, Singh suffered a rare poll loss, to the Samajwadi Party’s Kirtivardhan Singh, from Gonda.

Apart from his impressive poll influence, Singh wields clout via a chain of nearly 50 educational institutions run by him, spread across a 100-km belt from Ayodhya till Shravasti. In his wake, his relatives have also established such institutions, and local BJP sources say that Singh’s poll machinery is run almost entirely by this set-up, independent of the party.

They give the example of 2009, when Singh, sensing the dwindling fortunes of the BJP, switched to the SP, and won defeating a BJP candidate, from Kaiserganj. The 2009 elections at the Centre were won by the UPA, with the SP as an ally. Singh announced this decision during the nuclear deal debate in July 2008, at the time as a BJP MP.

Singh’s ties to the Sangh Parivar go back to before he joined the BJP. Considered close to the late VHP chief Ashok Singhal, Singh, who had studied at Ayodhya and was involved in student politics, was at the temple town when the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, 1992, and was booked along with others for “provoking” kar sevaks to demolish the structure. By then, Singh had already won his first election as a BJP candidate.","Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh's ties to the Sangh Parivar go back to before he joined the BJP (Facebook/Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh)While pressure is growing on the BJP to take action against its Kaiserganj MP and Wrestling Federation of India president Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, over allegations of sexual exploitation and harassment of wrestlers, the party has held out for four months.

On April 29, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met protesting wrestlers at Delhi's Jantar Mantar and expressed solidarity with them.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is facing allegations of sexual harassment from some of India's top wrestlers, including a minor. He reportedly said that he would step down as WFI chief if the BJP asked him to quit.

Several top wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar seeking Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh's arrest and ouster from the federation.

The first one pertains to allegations levelled by a minor victim which has been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act along with relevant Sections of the Indian Penal Code concerning outraging of modesty etc.

The second FIR has been registered for carrying out comprehensive investigations into the complaints tendered by other adult complainants under relevant sections pertaining to outraging of modesty.

Despite the FIRs and Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh offering to resign from his post, the protesting wrestlers have stayed their ground, saying they would continue their agitation until the BJP MP is arrested.

Wrestling has been an Olympic sport since 1896. But wrestling in India traces its origin to the fifth century BCE. In Akbar's court, in the 16th century, there were many wrestlers. The Ain-i-Akbari contains references to Mirza Khan of Gilan (in Iran), Muhammad Quli of Tabriz (in Iran), Cadiq of Bukhara (in Uzbekistan), Murad of Turkistan (in Kazakhstan), Hilal of Abyssinia, Kanhya, Mangol, Ganesh, Bajmath. The role of akharas in India’s struggle for Independence is legendary. Men's wrestling is tied to ideas of machismo, physical prowess. There is also an entire narrative around wrestling, the disciplining of the body, mind, morals. There are scholarly pieces on how wrestlers model themselves on sannyasis or ascetics.

The Switch

Women's wrestling in its present-day avatar is said to have started in France in the 1960s-1970s and was rooted in the second feminist movement. This was when contraception was legalised, as was abortion. If men's wrestling is about celebrating the body, women's wrestling has been about using the body to channelise a spirit and to defy traditional perceptions. Women were wrestling in Norway in the early 1970s. Japan took to it in the late 1980s. In 2004, women's wrestling was added to the Olympic repertoire. In 1997, no sooner than the announcement was made, ace wrestler Chandgi Ram started training his two daughters --- Sonika and Deepika Kaliraman. In 2001, Sonika won the Bharat Kesri title, but a decade later when she levelled charges of sexual misdemeanour against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), the selection committee and the coaching staff, she found herself in a takedown like no other. Last week, after much grappling with lawkeepers, seven women wrestlers have finally managed to file two FIRs against WFI boss and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who they have accused of sexual harassment. Don't cheer yet, Singh is a wrestler before anything else. There would be wisdom in anticipating and preparing for a sprawl out.","And India's very own, the Great Khali, is known for his vice grip, wherein he crushes the cranium of his opponent.

I agree that funding has been good and facilities have improved, but the respect for athletes is the same (as before) in their eyes. When we get medals, they get photos clicked to show they are proud of us but the reality is quite different. And for women, it’s even more difficult.

Those involved in the system wonder how a woman can speak so much against the system. They aren’t happy when women talk against the system.

When other athletes raise their voices when it comes to trials etc, it’s okay.

But when women raise their voices, they are targeted first. They ask, how did we get so much courage to speak against the system.

They say something but in their heart there is something else, and they portray something totally different. How we were being treated earlier, it’s the same. There’s no change in that aspect.

Nihal Koshie: How difficult was it for the victims and you to take that step?

It was difficult to explain to the girls’ families, to explain to ourselves and those around us that we’ve started this fight and have to continue. We were scared too. We fear the police. The first day when we took all the girls and went to the police station with the complaints, we feared the police so much because we had not faced them before.

Advertisement

Yes, we do have family members in the police but we’ve never faced them in such a situation. We didn’t know how the cops talk at the police station, or how they behave.

#WATCH | ""I have not yet received the FIR copy. I will speak once I've received the FIR copy,"" says Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, President, Wrestling Federation of India on wrestlers' protest against him and FIRs registered by Delhi police pic.twitter.com/FvU1FxkI35 — ANI (@ANI) April 29, 2023

The ministry told us to give them time and they would file an FIR according to the results of their finding. They told us not to worry about anything and that they would do everything. Now we think that we should have filed an FIR at that time itself and not waited.

Actually, we didn’t have courage at the time to file an FIR because we were wondering what would happen, and whom would we have to explain to. Media also, sometimes, troubles the victim by asking questions about the incident and what proof do we have. The families are also scared, wondering what their children are talking about openly.

We got fired up and started this fight. We thought it was a mistake to take on the system. We could’ve just not bothered and been happy wrestling. I mean, I can compete for another four-five years. I’ll compete at the Paris Olympics for sure. The family is crazy for an Olympic medal. And just before that, we are protesting. So many situations have risen, but somewhere we have found the courage. The fire for justice doesn’t die.

We know that we will get support from somewhere. God is not stone-hearted to see us struggle and fight so much, and then make us suffer.

Nihal Koshie: What led you to file an FIR now?

To be honest, we didn’t plan to file the FIR. And those who we are against never expected us to file the FIR either. They thought that if we actually wanted to file an FIR, we would have filed it then. As female athletes, they knew the problem or perhaps were trying to ignore it on purpose. They took advantage of our situation. They knew we were scared and respected people.

After the FIR, it’s like telling people that we are truthful, we have done nothing wrong. It’s good to get so much support. We have fought for smaller things, not for such a big thing. I believe in god and that he has a plan for everything. We have fought so much and he’ll not let it go to waste. He’s in control of everything. His plans are executed through us.

Mihir Vasavda: You could’ve finished your career comfortably, gone to Olympics, Brij Bhushan’s tenure as president was also getting over. What was the thinking behind picking up this fight now?

Actually, at trials and competitions where Brij Bhushan used to be there, he would say things like, ‘I’ll be in wrestling for (another) 20 years’. We thought this is not going to stop if he continues for 20 years. So many wrestlers will come into the sport and he’ll still be around. In my family, too, girls are getting into wrestling, they will be a certain age but Brij Bhushan will still be around. We tolerated somehow, and got out of the situation with courage. But what if the new athletes don’t even reach that level where they’ll be heard? That was worrying, that he’s here for the long haul. He considers it his fiefdom and everyone will be crushed under his feet. He’ll do whatever he feels like.

Mihir Vasavda: How was it dealing with the Federation officials?

How do I explain this? Suppose I have to go late to the national camp; for that you have to call (assistant secretary Vinod) Tomar; Tomar will ask neta (Brij Bhushan), then I have to ask the chief coach. He will ask for an application even if nothing is in his hands. Then Tomar won’t pick up the call the next day. If he’s angry with me, he’ll issue a show cause notice.

If my family has to get a certificate signed for a cash award from the Haryana government, if I’m not around they won’t even sign and will demand the athlete comes herself. They’ll keep troubling for the smallest of things. They’ll act obnoxiously and threaten by using the neta’s name. The treatment was awful. Even a tea-seller there had this attitude that ‘who the hell are you? I am the boss’. Even the water boy had a lot of attitude.

Advertisement

The way any athlete would be treated when we were going for any competition, and the facilities given to us would be of zero quality. We would mail asking them to send us two days in advance or for a physio that we need desperately, or to give us a good coach. It’s not like we can wrestle till 50 years. Our career span is small. Half of it goes in gaining experience, and when we are experienced these people don’t support us. We would be more exhausted dealing with them rather than in training or competition. Athletes are of no value in their eyes.

Mihir Vasavda: You have made a lot of comments about the Federation, Sports Ministry and Sports Authority of India. If the solution is reached to your satisfaction, how easy or difficult will it be for you to make a return to top-level competitions?

That’s a difficult question. We are thinking about what the situation can be in the future. But now that we have put our hand in the lion’s mouth, why be afraid! If we don’t say anything, then too we will be targeted, and if we open our mouths, something bad will happen to us. So let’s say it and face the consequences.

We know that we will face tough times, even if we win this fight. Not just during our careers, even after that, attempts will be made to remove any trace of our name and achievements from the sporting world and the sports community. But why care about those people and their feelings who have never achieved anything. If I have won a medal, that is registered in history. They can’t erase it.

Shivani Naik: Wrestling has a culture of giving respect, of listening to and following everything that people in authority say. Was that culture misused?

When Brij Bhushan was new in wrestling, he used to respect any good and upcoming wrestler. But as he started getting a firm foothold, he began to show his true colours. If a few wrestlers were good friends and training well together, he would send his own people there to break their friendship. He used to practise divide-and-rule policy.

Most wrestlers come from Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra, and are big on respect. Brij Bhushan has taken undue advantage of that. I would also blame athletes, as we stayed silent for a long time and tolerated a lot. If we had drawn a line earlier, things wouldn’t have come to this. Athletes would have faced difficulty in drawing a line against the system. There is not one Brij Bhushan, but several. How can we fight against so many? But if we can successfully deal with one, that will be a big thing in itself.

Sandeep Dwivedi: Winning an Olympic or World Championship medal takes a lifetime of effort. But no upcoming athlete would know how to counter these other challenges. What will be your message to them?

The tough journey is appreciated only by an athlete and their family. The toughest sports are taken up by those from the lower-income level families, who are used to hardships and difficulties. They think that they don’t have anything and so have no option but to work hard. They don’t have a Plan B. They only know they have to go ahead.

The craze of wrestling and other sports is growing. Especially in Haryana, people sell off their land to fund this dream, to fund a youngster’s training, diet and participation in competitions. To ensure that they stay fit and healthy, parents even stay awake with them. They save money to accompany them to competitions. If they don’t have money, they borrow it thinking they will repay it in a few months. They put everything in it in the hope that if their child becomes a top athlete, they will get everything… money, prestige, social status.

Thinking about all this, we thought what will come out of this struggle, even if we are successful. What will be our future? We knew we would perish regardless of whether we fought or not. But we thought that if we fought and won, we could form something better. But if we didn’t fight, we would have had a regret in life that we didn’t even try.

Sandeep Dwivedi: What gives you the strength to keep going on?

We don’t know from where we are getting the strength. I don’t know if we are actually normal or we are acting to be normal. We have stopped feeling anything. We don’t even know where the path we have chosen will lead us, there are so many obstacles along the way. If we clear one hurdle, something else will come up.

But, yes, if all the athletes come together, if they gather the strength — that we have to fight — then no one can do anything to an athlete. Not just wrestlers, but every sportsperson.

The entire country worships cricket but not a single cricketer has spoken up. We aren’t saying you speak in our favour but at least put out a neutral message and say there should be justice for whichever party. This is what pains me.

Every sports federation has a problem and a lot of athletes are my friends as well. But there should be no pretensions. I go to their matches, they come for mine, we get a photo clicked together, congratulate one another upon winning a medal, put nice messages like ‘onwards and upwards’… Athletes need to get out of the social media bubble and express real-world emotions. They should look beyond their personal gains and ask their conscience… We are human. We will also quit the sport someday. We should leave a legacy outside sports, too.

Sriram Veera: You spoke about lack of support. Some might fear, ‘Oh this is a sensitive issue; how do we know what really happened, how can we get into this?’ What do you have to say to those people?

What do they think, will we do these things just to get exemption from trials or not take part in national championships? We don’t take these allegations lightly. They should have this common sense. If you can’t raise your voice against the system… If this was such a small issue then why would we fight this battle that’ll only lead to lifelong animosity?

Log kehte hai wrestlers ka dimaag ghutno mein hota hai (People say wrestlers are not intelligent). But I’ll say our dil (heart), dimaag (brain), everything is in the right place. Other athletes need to check where their brain is. Dil toh unke paas hai hi nahi (They don’t have a heart).

If we don’t deserve their support in these times of struggle then, god-willing, if we win a medal tomorrow — and we will work very hard for it — then don’t come to congratulate us; don’t say you had faith in our abilities because you didn’t, that’s why you are doubting us now.

Sriram Veera: Can you talk about your courage? Where does it spring from?

It’s my mother. Our relationship is stronger than the bond between friends. We share everything. She was about 32 when she became a widow. I feel sad thinking about it. She struggled for us. In that struggle, we didn’t even realise when we grew up. A single woman, she would be taunted by others, how they treated her. Before my father died, my mother didn’t even step out of the house; she didn’t even know what was the price of tomatoes. Suddenly, tragedy struck.

Then she suffered from cancer, and would go to Rohtak for chemotherapy. Totally illiterate, she didn’t even know where to sit, where to get off. No one supported her. We grew up seeing her struggle. If a single woman like that, illiterate, could fight the society on her own and made us big wrestlers, then we can do it too. If we don’t speak out today, then all the struggles of my mother would have gone to waste. I won medals, that’s all right, but if we win this battle, she will proudly say, ‘I gave birth to them’.

I am proud that my mother showed so much strength and character; I guess that’s in me as well. Even my father was like that. I am also like that. I speak straight and honestly, and say what I feel.

It’s been misunderstood. Some feel, ‘arre yeh toh moofatt hai’ (she’s outspoken), but what can I tell them. I speak my mind. What’s inside is what comes out. Take it or leave it, and go home (laughs).","We didn’t know how the cops talk at the police station, or how they behave.
But what if the new athletes don’t even reach that level where they’ll be heard?
If we don’t say anything, then too we will be targeted, and if we open our mouths, something bad will happen to us.
But if we didn’t fight, we would have had a regret in life that we didn’t even try.

Karnal, April 30

Union Minister Ramdas Athawale on Sunday demanded a thorough probe into the allegations levelled by women wrestlers against chairman of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

“There should be a thorough probe in this case,” he said in response to a question asked by the mediapersons here, where he listened to PM Narendra Modi’s 100th episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’. After this programme, he addressed party workers at the Dr Mangal Sen Auditorium.

Athawale, who is also the national president of the Republican Party of India, said they would approach the BJP for an alliance for the Haryana Assembly elections. “If the alliance is forged, we will extend our support to the BJP. Else, we will contest some seats and on remaining seats we will support the BJP candidates,” said the Union Minister.

He praised Modi for his working style. About former Congress president Rahul Gandhi he said, “Under Rahul’s leadership, the tally of the Congress will not increase.”

On the third and fourth fronts, the Union Minister said it would have no impact. “There will be no impact on the NDA by the formation of any third or fourth front. We will not allow entry of Nitish Kumar in the NDA, even if he wishes to join. The NDA government will be in power till 2039,” Athawale said.

Mary Kom, who was in charge of the oversight committee looking into allegations of sexual harassment against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), kept mum about the ongoing crisis.

After failing to win a second Olympic medal in Tokyo in 2020, the six-time world champion tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee during the 2022 Commonwealth Games trials in June last year.

""(The) Injury is much better now. I can walk, run, though not on hard surface. I just started running on (a) tread mill,"" Mary Kom told reporters after she was awarded the PC Chandra Puraskaar 2023 here.

""I'm pushing myself. After one month, I'll be fully fit and recovered. I'll be ready to fight in the ring in two months' time,"" she said.

Asked whether she will compete at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, Mary Kom said, ""This year I've a chance to compete in any competition. Next year by force, I'm not eligible.""

Her bid for a second Olympic medal is finished because she will be 40 in November and will thus be ineligible to compete in any international event, including the 2024 Olympics in Paris.

Mary Kom, however, said that while rules can stop her from competing in another Olympics, ""nobody can stop me from fighting"".

""By force I'm not eligible to fight in the Olympics because of the age limit. I'm very sorry for that. But I want to continue, keep fighting for another three-four years. I still have that confidence and willpower.

""I'm thinking, I can also become a pro. I've that confidence. Nobody can stop me from fighting.""

The boxing legend underwent surgery at a Mumbai hospital in August last year.

Terming it as the worst phase of her career, Mary Kom said she would have preferred ""death"" to the painful phase.

""It was so painful... I didn't expect this injury. It was bad luck. It wasn't a minor injury, but a major grade-III ACL tear. People said I won't be able to run again, forget (about) fighting. Six months after the operation, there was still unbearable pain that (I) preferred death.

""In my life, I've struggled a lot, did hard work... so much that I never cried and took all the pain. But this (recovery) was unbearable. Only once before in my life, I had cried when I had lost my passport and then I attempted suicide, as I did not have the money to apply for a fresh passport,"" she recalled.

India made history earlier this year, winning four gold medals (Nitu Ghanghas, Nikhat Zareen, Lovlina Borgohain and Saweety Boora) at the Women's World Boxing Championships.

In 2006, the quartet of Mary Kom, Sarita Devi, Jenny Lalremliani and Lekha KC had achieved the feat for the first time.

These have been put on record in complaints filed by two of the seven women wrestlers — both adults — against the federation’s president and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, The Indian Express has learnt.

The two separate complaints, filed on April 21, at New Delhi’s Connaught Place police station, list at least eight incidents.

Both the complainants have put on record how Singh allegedly used the pretext of checking their breathing patterns to touch them inappropriately and sexually, The Indian Express has learnt.

Has called the allegations part of a political vendetta Has called the allegations part of a political vendetta

According to the complaints, Singh’s influence as WFI

president and the fear that he would create hurdles in their career were why these wrestlers didn’t speak up earlier although they were mentally and physically exploited.

In her complaint, Wrestler 1 (her name has been with-held to protect her identity), has put down at least five incidents of alleged sexual harassment against Singh.

One was at a restaurant during a tournament in 2016, when Singh allegedly touched her breast and stomach after asking her to join him at the table. In the complaint, Wrestler 1 is said to have mentioned that after this alleged incident, she did not feel like eating, her sleep was disturbed and she was distressed. She alleged that a similar incident, where Singh once again touched her breast and stomach, happened at another tournament in 2019.

In her complaint, Wrestler 1 is said to have accused Singh of touching her inappropriately and groping her on two days when she was called to the WFI office that’s located within Singh’s MP bungalow at 21, Ashoka Road in New Delhi.

On the first day, she is said to have written in her complaint, Singh touched her thighs and shoulder without her consent and when she was asked to report to the WFI office two days later, he touched her breast and put his hand on her stomach saying he wanted to check her breathing pattern.

In 2018, during a tournament, Singh allegedly hugged Wrestler 1 tightly for a prolonged period of time and during another tournament, Wrestler 1 had to wriggle out of the hug because Singh’s hand was close to her breast.

The second complainant, Wrestler 2, (her name has been with-held to protect her identity) has alleged that when she was warming up, Singh lifted her training jersey without her consent in 2018 and touching her breast and stomach saying he wanted to check her breathing pattern. In her complaint, Wrestler 2 has reportedly said this left her traumatised and shocked.

Wrestler 2 has alleged that the second incident occurred a year later at the WFI office at Singh’s Ashoka Road bungalow. When she entered his office, she is said to have complained, Singh allegedly asked the others to leave, following which he allegedly pulled Wrestler 2 close and tried to grope her. Singh also allegedly exchanged numbers with Wrestler 2 at his office.

When contacted, both the wrestlers declined to comment on their complaints against Singh. Incidentally, earlier this week, both these wrestlers also recorded their statements to the Delhi Police under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Singh was unavailable for comment despite several calls. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing and called the allegations part of a political vendetta and a conspiracy by rivals who want to displace him from the wrestling establishment.

Some of the country’s top wrestlers — Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik and two-time World Championship medalist Vinesh Phogat – have been protesting at Jantar Mantar since April 23 demanding Singh’s arrest.

Complaints of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation, including one by a minor, were filed on April 21. But when the police didn’t file FIRs, the wrestlers approached the Supreme Court. Subsequently, the police filed two FIRs, one under the POCSO Act and a second based on the complaints of the adult women wrestlers.

On Thursday, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud did not entertain a plea by the wrestlers that the ongoing police investigation against Singh be monitored by a retired judge of the Supreme Court or High Court.

The apex court said they were at liberty to move the jurisdictional magistrate court or the Delhi High Court if they felt further directions were needed.

Significantly, these two wrestlers were among those who also appeared before the Oversight Committee set up by the Sports Ministry in January after the first protests in Jantar Mantar.

These have been put on record in complaints filed by two of the seven women wrestlers — both adults — against the federation’s president and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, The Indian Express has learnt.

The two separate complaints, filed on April 21, at New Delhi’s Connaught Place police station, list at least eight incidents.

According to the complaints, Singh’s influence as WFI

president and the fear that he would create hurdles in their career were why these wrestlers didn’t speak up earlier although they were mentally and physically exploited.

In her complaint, Wrestler 1 (her name has been with-held to protect her identity), has put down at least five incidents of alleged sexual harassment against Singh.

One was at a restaurant during a tournament in 2016, when Singh allegedly touched her breast and stomach after asking her to join him at the table. In the complaint, Wrestler 1 is said to have mentioned that after this alleged incident, she did not feel like eating, her sleep was disturbed and she was distressed. She alleged that a similar incident, where Singh once again touched her breast and stomach, happened at another tournament in 2019.

In her complaint, Wrestler 1 is said to have accused Singh of touching her inappropriately and groping her on two days when she was called to the WFI office that’s located within Singh’s MP bungalow at 21, Ashoka Road in New Delhi.

On the first day, she is said to have written in her complaint, Singh touched her thighs and shoulder without her consent and when she was asked to report to the WFI office two days later, he touched her breast and put his hand on her stomach saying he wanted to check her breathing pattern.

In 2018, during a tournament, Singh allegedly hugged Wrestler 1 tightly for a prolonged period of time and during another tournament, Wrestler 1 had to wriggle out of the hug because Singh’s hand was close to her breast.

The second complainant, Wrestler 2, (her name has been with-held to protect her identity) has alleged that when she was warming up, Singh lifted her training jersey without her consent in 2018 and touching her breast and stomach saying he wanted to check her breathing pattern. In her complaint, Wrestler 2 has reportedly said this left her traumatised and shocked.

Wrestler 2 has alleged that the second incident occurred a year later at the WFI office at Singh’s Ashoka Road bungalow. When she entered his office, she is said to have complained, Singh allegedly asked the others to leave, following which he allegedly pulled Wrestler 2 close and tried to grope her. Singh also allegedly exchanged numbers with Wrestler 2 at his office.

When contacted, both the wrestlers declined to comment on their complaints against Singh. Incidentally, earlier this week, both these wrestlers also recorded their statements to the Delhi Police under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Singh was unavailable for comment despite several calls. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing and called the allegations part of a political vendetta and a conspiracy by rivals who want to displace him from the wrestling establishment.

Some of the country’s top wrestlers — Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik and two-time World Championship medalist Vinesh Phogat – have been protesting at Jantar Mantar since April 23 demanding Singh’s arrest.

Complaints of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation, including one by a minor, were filed on April 21. But when the police didn’t file FIRs, the wrestlers approached the Supreme Court. Subsequently, the police filed two FIRs, one under the POCSO Act and a second based on the complaints of the adult women wrestlers.

On Thursday, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud did not entertain a plea by the wrestlers that the ongoing police investigation against Singh be monitored by a retired judge of the Supreme Court or High Court.

The apex court said they were at liberty to move the jurisdictional magistrate court or the Delhi High Court if they felt further directions were needed.

The video is being shared as wrestlers such as Vinesh Phogat, Sakshee Malikkh, Bajrang Punia are sitting in protest at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar against the WFI chief accusing him of sexually harassing multiple female wrestlers.

Singh, who is also the Bharatiya Janata Pary MP from Uttar Pradesh, has remained a controversial figure over the years and earlier slapped a wrestler for confronting him on-stage in Jharkhand. The wrestlers, at a recent media interaction, made strong allegations against Singh and alleged that earlier attempts to file an FIR against the WFI president were roadblocked due to his strong political influence.

However, BOOM found that the video shows a clipped interview of Sakshee Malikkh where she can be seen talking about her first gold medal win in the 2022 Commonwealth Games and crediting the victory to Brij Bhushan Saran Singh as the WFI head.

A Twitter user named Adv. Ashutosh J. Dubey tweeted the video along with a picture of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president PT Usha at Jantar Mantar saying, ""Here is the same day video where Vinesh Phogat mentioned: All credit goes to WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh Ji.""

The description with the video says, ""Sakshi Malik won her first Commonwealth Games gold medal on Friday and she was elted with her performance. She told NDTV's Rica Roy about her strategy of watching the opponent closely before going for the attack.""



During the interview, when Malikkh was asked about her view about the success of Indian wrestling in the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, she replies with, ""We have done a great performance today. One or two more gold could come - I feel (sad) about it. But leaving it, we will do better next time.""

She further continues saying, ""A lot of this credit goes to our president sir of Indian wrestling federation. Cause, now a lot of tournaments happening in India and the competitions there have increased so much that it feels like fighting in India is tough. It feels that we can do better when outside. We are working too hard for the victory in the Indian tournaments. So, the credits go to the wrestling federation and Brij Bhushan sir for uplifting the wrestling to such a high level.""

“I am a devotee of Lord Hanuman. Whenever I get into trouble, Lord Hanuman protects me and becomes my saviour,” Singh told reporters as he emerged from the temple on Thursday, referring to the Supreme Court decision on Thursday to dispose of the petition filed by three woman wrestlers against Singh, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker from the Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat.

The Supreme Court noted that the petition sought registration of a first information report (FIR) against Singh and the Delhi Police have filed two cases against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, and justices PS Narsimsha and JB Pardiwala said: “Keeping in mind the ambit of these proceedings and following the registration of FIR, we close the proceedings at this stage.

“I have faith in Supreme Court and I thank the court for closing proceedings against me,” the WFI president added, standing outside the temple in Ayodhya.

Drawing fire over sexual harassment allegations by top wrestlers, BJP MP and chief of the country's wrestling federation Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has reiterated that the charges are baseless, but added that he is ready to step down if Prime Minister Narendra Modi or BJP asks him to.

Mr Singh's recent remark, in which he said he would resign if PM Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah or BJP chief JP Nadda asked him to, has put the BJP in a spot. Opposition parties, which have been accusing the BJP leadership of shielding Mr Singh despite the serious allegations, are now demanding that the PM asked the MP to step down.

In an interview to NDTV, Mr Singh said, ""Why will (Prime Minister) Modi ji ask me to (resign)? And if he asks me to, I will. If my party is suffering because of me, its image is being maligned, then if Modi ji or the party asks me to (resign), I will.""

The country's top wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for a week now. They have been demanding action into allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Singh by several wrestlers, including a minor.

Delhi Police has filed two cases against Mr Singh following the recent allegations of sexual harassment. One of them has been registered under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on a minor's complaint.

Several opposition leaders have met the wrestlers and extended their support to them. They have also raised the matter during the campaign for the upcoming Assembly polls in Karnataka.

Asked about the wrestlers' protest turning into a poll issue in Karnataka, Mr Singh said, ""In our camps, wrestlers from Karnataka come too. So do wrestlers from Kerala, Bengal, Odisha, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh. Why don't such incidents happen to them? Why only with these people? [the protesting wrestlers].""

""I have given the slogan, 'one family, one akhada', you tell me, where are (the others)?,"" Mr Singh said, rattling the names of several wrestlers who had not joined the protest so far.

The six-time MP from Uttar Pradesh has alleged a political conspiracy against him. While he did not name the ""family"", it is an apparent reference to the Phogat family, which has given the country many top wrestlers and has come out strongly against Mr Singh.

Vinesh and Bajrang Punia, her brother-in-law are among the prominent faces of the ongoing protest. Geeta Phogat, Vinesh's cousin and the eldest of the Phogat sisters whose story inspired the movie Dangal, has been backing the protest. Geeta's younger sister Babita, a leader of BJP's youth wing, has come under criticism, with the wrestlers asking her not to ""weaken"" their protest.

Deepender Hooda, a Rajya Sabha MP, has trashed Mr Singh's allegations against him. Accusing him of trying to ""divert attention from his crimes"", Mr Hooda said, ""It's a criminal issue related to respect for our daughters. I would like to tell BJP that this is not a political issue.""","In an interview to NDTV, Mr Singh said, ""Why will (Prime Minister) Modi ji ask me to (resign)?

Would there have been propaganda unleashed against those who have accused him by labelling them ‘anti-government’?

In a cruel sense, Singh is lucky that he belongs to the BJP, because otherwise he might have even been in jail by now. Even a Supreme Court intervention has not prompted the Delhi Police to arrest him.

Instead of feeling ashamed, he is holding press conferences, accusing the Congress and wrestlers of conspiring against him to discredit him.

This is symptomatic of the malaise which has inflicted the police system (and even threatens the judicial system), which, if allowed to continue, can lead to its collapse. It smacks of partisanship of the highest order, and exposes the hypocrisy of a government which gloats about its programme focused on the girl child: Beti Padao, Beti Bachao. This also reflects the fact that some of those who take great pride in the Hindu ethos of very exalted status of women and quote the shloka, ‘yatra naryastu pujyante, ramante tatra devata’ (where women are honoured, divinity blossoms there) are duplicitous in practice.

In case of sexual harassment, the law is explicit that the word of the woman is sufficient to arrest the accused. A sexual harassment charge is criminal in nature, and the wheels of justice should have moved immediately; instead, the government formed a committee led by renowned boxer Mary Kom to probe the allegations. This could have been justified if intent of the government was to get to the bottom of the matter to cleanse the system, and put things in order so that no women athlete would face the same ignominy in future. Unfortunately, the intent was to find a political solution. The strategy did not work, and it is not surprising that the athletes are unhappy with the conduct of the Union government.

The Union government has further exposed itself by not making public the findings of the committee report, which was submitted in first week of April. Babita Phogat, a member of the committee, has alleged that she was not allowed to read the report, and that the report was snatched away from her before she could glance through. If true, this further increases the intentions of the government. If the government was serious about the problem, it should have not only published the report, but also acted by now.

Dissatisfied with the government’s response, the protesting wrestlers knocked on the Supreme Court’s door, where the Delhi Police unashamedly has said that if the court desired an FIR could be lodged the same day itself. It took four months and prodding from the top court for the Delhi Police to file two FIRs, both naming Singh.

It is obvious that the police is not interested in pursuing this case — but what is it that makes it so brazen?

Ideally, the police should have arrested Singh in January itself. But two things worked for him. One, he is a BJP MP who is supposedly very close to a powerful minister in the Union Cabinet. Two, he belongs to the politically-powerful community of the Rajputs. The Rajputs in Uttar Pradesh are very influential, and the BJP does not want to upset the community. Singh himself is a seasoned leader, and can impact electoral fortunes of the BJP in four/five Lok Sabha seats around Gonda district.

A third reason is that the Delhi Police is allegedly a compromised force. Many senior officers in it are either eyeing post-retirement sinecures or are those who toe the government’s ideological line without questioning. These police officers either do not take cognisance of complaints/cases against the ruling alliance, or when it does, it is not in a hurry to do its job.

A few years back when a few masked men and women unleashed violence in front of the TV cameras in JNU and later, when a few were identified as ABVP activists by a TV channel, the Delhi Police did precious little. More than a dozen Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs and leaders were arrested on frivolous charges. In most cases the courts were livid about the way the investigation was carried out. Most of them were exonerated by the courts. In the past, the police has not taken notice of the provocative statements made by BJP leaders such as Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma, and Kapil Mishra. Serious allegations were levelled against the Delhi Police during the 2020 Delhi riots in which 53 persons lost their lives (two-third of which were Muslims). During the investigations into the riots even lawyers who were helping the Muslim community were intimidated, and their houses were raided.

It is not surprising that the Delhi Police has not taken any action based on the wrestlers’ complaint. What is surprising is its audacity. Despite the apex court’s intervention, it is disinclined to arrest Singh. This is not possible unless the Delhi Police has clear instructions from up the hierarchy. Is it a coincidence that the Delhi Police reports to the Union government and Amit Shah is the Home Minister?

The men's national camp for free style and Greco-Roman wrestlers is held at the SAI centre in Bahalgarh (Sonepat) while the women's camp is organised in Lucknow.

The country's premier wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, have levelled sexual harassment allegations against Brij Bhushan and resumed their protest at Jantar Mantar on April 23.

The national camp was closed on April 8, a day before the Asian Championship in Astana, Kazakhstan, and has not yet restarted.

More than 300 wrestlers in 10 weight categories -- senior, junior, cadet and U-15 -- train at the SAI Centre in Sonepat while the Lucknow centre accommodates more than 100 women wrestlers.

""I don't have proper sparring partners with me to train. We need to be in national camp. The Asian Games trials are just two months away. The SAI should restart the camp. Why should the junior wrestlers suffer,"" Narsingh Pancham Yadav said from Mumbai.

""There are about 25 wrestlers where I train and most of them are junior. So obviously I don't have proper training partners. They are inexperienced. Not much time is left for Asian Games and after that, the World Championship is also scheduled. The national camp must restart,"" said the national championship silver medallist.

Asked about the ongoing protest by the top wresters, Narsingh said, ""I don't know the truth. If something like that (sexual harassment) has happened, then it's wrong.""

Sandeep Deshwal, who competes in Greco-Roman style in 82kg category, also said it has been a struggle for him since the national camp shut.

""I am in Rohtak since the camp closed. It's really difficult. I have spoken to the coaches also several times but no one knows why the national camp is not restarting.""

National Greco-Roman coach Hargobind Singh also appeared clueless.

""I have spoken to SAI officials multiple times but have not got a definitive answer. A lot of time has passed since the Asian Championship in Astana (April 9-14). By this time the camp should have resumed,"" said Hargobind.

""It's an Asian Games year and there should not be this big a gap in training,"" he added.

The Indian wrestlers had won 14 medals at the Asian Championship with the women winning seven of them.

While Bajrang Punia, Ravi Dahiya (injury) and Vinesh Phogat chose not to compete in Astana, other prominent wrestlers, like Deepak Punia and Sarita Mor, who are World Championships medallists, could not win a medal.

Lalita Sharma, the executive director at SAI Sonpeat centre, said they have ""not received any communication regarding the national camp as of now"".

The PTI tried to reach out to SAI DG Sandip Pradhan but several calls to him went unanswered. He also did not respond to messages.

Meanwhile, a woman wrestler said unless there is clarity she won't like to join the national camp.

""I am doing fine at my training centre. There has to be clarity who the coaches will be at the camp and who do we need to reach out to, in case there is an issue. Wrestling is as much mental as physical. In the current scenario, it's difficult to say anything if I would like to rejoin the camp.

""If the camp resumes at Lucknow centre only, then it should be fine but if it's shifted to some other place, we need to get clarity on a few things. Otherwise also not many women wrestlers join the camp, most of them prefer to train at their own training centres,"" she said.","The men's national camp for free style and Greco-Roman wrestlers is held at the SAI centre in Bahalgarh (Sonepat) while the women's camp is organised in Lucknow.

Vinesh, the biggest face of the wrestlers' protest, claimed that sexual harassment cases were reported twice in the past during the national camp, but the WFI succeeded in sweeping the matter under the carpet.

The World championship medallist said the complainants had shared their ordeal in a meeting with the Sports Minister, but he did not do anything except for constituting an oversight panel. The wrestlers had called off their protest in January after getting assurances from the government that the matter would be probed, and a five-member panel was formed to look into the allegations of sexual harassment against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

""During the 2012 national camp, a sexual harassment complaint was lodged at a police station. Within 24 hours that case was hushed up. In 2014, a physio, who was also trainer of Geeta Phogat, raised a similar matter and he was removed from the camp within 24 hours. From that day, his wife could not participate in any competition,"" Vinesh said.

""Before we started our protest, three months back, we had explained everything to a government official how sexual harassment was taking place and how women wrestlers were being tortured mentally. The athletes were being pushed to a stage where they could have done anything with their lives,"" she added.

She continued, ""We waited for three-four months but when nothing happened, we came to Jantar Mantar. When we met the sports minister, the women wrestlers shared individual incidents related to sexual harassment. The girls were crying before him but no action was taken at that time.""

""Sports Minister tried to hush up matter yet again by forming a committee. We have tried to raise this issue at every level but the matter was always suppressed,"" said Vinesh.

The Asian Games gold medallist also opined that people could now understand why they were silent for 12 years. ""We had to play sport. Our career, life was at stake and that's why we could not muster enough courage. Now we have reached a stage in our careers where we could speak. It's not easy to stand against a powerful man,"" she said.

Sakshi Malik refuted allegations that the protests were a means to claim exemption from wrestling trials. Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty Images

Sakshi Malik said the motive behind the protest, as being projected, was not to seek exemptions from trials. She claimed she was asked to appear in a trial abroad when she had already won a trial in India. Another girl, in 2012, was asked to reappear in a trial within 24 hours of winning.

""She was vomiting during the retrial bouts. I had told her that we do not have status to fight with these men,"" added Vinesh.

Vinesh also alleged that the Delhi Police was not doing its job properly.

""The Delhi Police has not yet recorded any statement. They are helping in breaking the victims, using power and position. Delhi Police is trying to delay the matter. They are giving information to Brij Bhushan. Maybe we will get justice only from the Supreme Court.""

""The kind of language he (WFI chief) is using on national television gives an indication how he can behave with women in a closed room. If he wants a fair probe, he should himself go to the police station, get himself arrested and co-operate with police in probe. After that if nothing comes out, we should be held guilty,"" said Vinesh, who added that she has not met Brij Bhushan in the last two years.

Bajrang Punia also claimed that they have support of many wrestlers, but they do not want to disturb their training, and that is why not many are at the protest site.","Vinesh Phogat has alleged that complaints related to sexual harassment have been hushed up in the past by the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and that Sports Minister Anurag Thakur did the same by forming an oversight panel instead of taking concrete action.

She said, “Three-Four months before we sat at Jantar Mantar, we had met an official, we had told him everything that how women athletes are sexually harassed and mentally tortured when no action was taken, then we sat on Dharna.""

She also slammed Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur for not taking any action and suppressing the matter by forming a committee.

""We ended our protest after talking to Union Sports Minister (Anurag Thakur), and all the athletes had told him about the sexual harassment. He by forming a committee tried to suppress the matter there; no action was taken that time,"" She said.

Bajrang Punia addressed the allegations that they are protesting against new rules introduced for the Olympics.

He said, ""He (Brij Bhusan) is saying that we have made some rules for the Olympics and therefore these athletes are protesting; firstly, this is not about the Olympics, this is against sexual harassment. And if I talk about the Olympic rule; the federation will take trails of athletes coming from the Olympics, whoever they want.""

Earlier on Monday, Brij Bhushan Shran Singh said that he would resign ‘if his party asked him to’. In an interview with ANI, he said, “If my party asks me to resign, I will resign...Forces involved in 'Tukde Tukde gang', Shaheen Bagh, 'Kisaan Andolan' seem to be involved in it (Wrestlers' protest), I am not their target, party (BJP ) is their target, these athletes are paid. Protest is expanding like Shaheen Bagh, they want to divide UP and Haryana."" He also alleged that wrestler Bajrang Punia had asked someone to “arrange a girl"" in order to level sexual harassment charges under the POCSO act.

Earlier on Saturday, the WFI chief asserted that if he resigns from his post it would mean that he has accepted the allegations which have been raised by the wrestlers. Reacting to World Wrestling Federation Chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh's remark she said that all they wanted was justice.

The Delhi Police on Friday registered two FIRs against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment and exploitation of female wrestlers by him. He also said that 90 per cent of Haryana players stand with him while only one wrestling family continues to protest at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi.Earlier on April 26, Wrestlers held a candle march at Jantar Mantar urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their 'Mann Ki Baat'.

While talking to the media, Sakshee said, ""We urge PM Modi to listen to our Mann Ki Baat. Even Smriti Irani ji is not listening to us. We are trying to show them the light through this candle march,"" said Sakshee to the media.

Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist wrestler Bajrang Punia and star wrestlers like Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik on Friday said that they will continue their protest against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh until he is sent behind bars.

Top Indian grapplers such as Vinesh Phogat, Sakshee Malikkh, Bajrang Punia, and many others wrestlers are involved in the protest against the WFI chief. Over the last six days, the wrestlers have slept and trained at the protest site near Jantar Mantar in the national capital.

New Delhi, May 2

Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik have accepted that the fight to get justice in the sexual harassment case against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh would be a long-drawn-out affair. The protesting wrestlers said they have decided to put the other charges, including financial irregularities against the WFI, on the back burner because the issue of female athletes’ safety is paramount.

Our sport tests us both mentally and physically. The struggle and anxiety before a competition is very different. We do not have the same feeling here. This is no struggle. We are fighting for justice. Sakshi Malik

The wrestlers once again questioned why Singh has not yet been called in for questioning, especially when one of the alleged offences is abusing a minor. The Delhi Police had registered two FIRs on April 28.

“The Delhi Police have not done anything so far,” Bajrang said.

Sakshi said: “The victims’ statements are yet to be recorded. What kind of an investigation is this? Brij Bhushan is yet to be summoned.”

The duo said that training for the Asian Games was not even on their minds currently. “Brij Bhushan has retired us already, and we are ready to sacrifice everything to get justice,” Bajrang said. “We know that till the time either he or his people are in the federation we will not be allowed to compete. So we want a complete clean-up of the body. Singh and his people should leave,” he added.

‘Usha, Mary are politicians’

Sakshi and Bajrang said that they were hurt by the comments of former sprinter PT Usha, who in her new avatar as the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president criticised the wrestlers for continuing the protest. IOA joint secretary Kalyan Chaubey had alluded that the protest was harming the country’s image.

“We are much better than people like Mary Kom and PT Usha,” Sakshi said. “If former athletes such as them do not support us, it’s a matter of shame. We do not want them to sit here with us. We just want them to support us,” she added.

“I have been hearing since my childhood that politicians cannot be trusted as they turn on their families. They (Usha and Mary) have proved it. These are the people I grew up watching and aspired to become, but I have learnt my lessons the hard way,” the Rio Olympics bronze medal winner added.

Bajrang said: “PT Usha must realise that she got this position because of her sports achievements, but she has become a politician now.”

The video is being shared as wrestlers such as Vinesh Phogat, Sakshee Malikkh, Bajrang Punia are sitting in protest at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar against the WFI chief accusing him of sexually harassing multiple female wrestlers.

Singh, who is also the Bharatiya Janata Pary MP from Uttar Pradesh, has remained a controversial figure over the years and earlier slapped a wrestler for confronting him on-stage in Jharkhand. The wrestlers, at a recent media interaction, made strong allegations against Singh and alleged that earlier attempts to file an FIR against the WFI president were roadblocked due to his strong political influence.

However, BOOM found that the video shows a clipped interview of Sakshee Malikkh where she can be seen talking about her first gold medal win in the 2022 Commonwealth Games and crediting the victory to Brij Bhushan Saran Singh as the WFI head.

A Twitter user named Adv. Ashutosh J. Dubey tweeted the video along with a picture of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president PT Usha at Jantar Mantar saying, ""Here is the same day video where Vinesh Phogat mentioned: All credit goes to WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh Ji.""

She further continues saying, ""A lot of this credit goes to our president sir of Indian wrestling federation.

“I am a devotee of Lord Hanuman. Whenever I get into trouble, Lord Hanuman protects me and becomes my saviour,” Singh told reporters as he emerged from the temple on Thursday, referring to the Supreme Court decision on Thursday to dispose of the petition filed by three woman wrestlers against Singh, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker from the Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat.

The Supreme Court noted that the petition sought registration of a first information report (FIR) against Singh and the Delhi Police have filed two cases against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, and justices PS Narsimsha and JB Pardiwala said: “Keeping in mind the ambit of these proceedings and following the registration of FIR, we close the proceedings at this stage. The petitioners are at liberty to seek further directions before the jurisdictional magistrate or the high court under Article 226.”

“I have faith in Supreme Court and I thank the court for closing proceedings against me,” the WFI president added, standing outside the temple in Ayodhya.

Drawing fire over sexual harassment allegations by top wrestlers, BJP MP and chief of the country's wrestling federation Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has reiterated that the charges are baseless, but added that he is ready to step down if Prime Minister Narendra Modi or BJP asks him to.

Mr Singh's recent remark, in which he said he would resign if PM Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah or BJP chief JP Nadda asked him to, has put the BJP in a spot. Opposition parties, which have been accusing the BJP leadership of shielding Mr Singh despite the serious allegations, are now demanding that the PM asked the MP to step down.

In an interview to NDTV, Mr Singh said, ""Why will (Prime Minister) Modi ji ask me to (resign)? And if he asks me to, I will. If my party is suffering because of me, its image is being maligned, then if Modi ji or the party asks me to (resign), I will.""

The country's top wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for a week now. They have been demanding action into allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Singh by several wrestlers, including a minor.

Delhi Police has filed two cases against Mr Singh following the recent allegations of sexual harassment. One of them has been registered under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on a minor's complaint.

Several opposition leaders have met the wrestlers and extended their support to them. They have also raised the matter during the campaign for the upcoming Assembly polls in Karnataka.

Asked about the wrestlers' protest turning into a poll issue in Karnataka, Mr Singh said, ""In our camps, wrestlers from Karnataka come too. So do wrestlers from Kerala, Bengal, Odisha, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh. Why don't such incidents happen to them? Why only with these people? [the protesting wrestlers].""

""I have given the slogan, 'one family, one akhada', you tell me, where are (the others)?,"" Mr Singh said, rattling the names of several wrestlers who had not joined the protest so far.

The six-time MP from Uttar Pradesh has alleged a political conspiracy against him. While he did not name the ""family"", it is an apparent reference to the Phogat family, which has given the country many top wrestlers and has come out strongly against Mr Singh.

Vinesh and Bajrang Punia, her brother-in-law are among the prominent faces of the ongoing protest. Geeta Phogat, Vinesh's cousin and the eldest of the Phogat sisters whose story inspired the movie Dangal, has been backing the protest. Geeta's younger sister Babita, a leader of BJP's youth wing, has come under criticism, with the wrestlers asking her not to ""weaken"" their protest.

Deepender Hooda, a Rajya Sabha MP, has trashed Mr Singh's allegations against him. Accusing him of trying to ""divert attention from his crimes"", Mr Hooda said, ""It's a criminal issue related to respect for our daughters. I would like to tell BJP that this is not a political issue.""","In an interview to NDTV, Mr Singh said, ""Why will (Prime Minister) Modi ji ask me to (resign)?

Would there have been propaganda unleashed against those who have accused him by labelling them ‘anti-government’?

In a cruel sense, Singh is lucky that he belongs to the BJP, because otherwise he might have even been in jail by now. Even a Supreme Court intervention has not prompted the Delhi Police to arrest him.

Instead of feeling ashamed, he is holding press conferences, accusing the Congress and wrestlers of conspiring against him to discredit him.

This is symptomatic of the malaise which has inflicted the police system (and even threatens the judicial system), which, if allowed to continue, can lead to its collapse. It smacks of partisanship of the highest order, and exposes the hypocrisy of a government which gloats about its programme focused on the girl child: Beti Padao, Beti Bachao. This also reflects the fact that some of those who take great pride in the Hindu ethos of very exalted status of women and quote the shloka, ‘yatra naryastu pujyante, ramante tatra devata’ (where women are honoured, divinity blossoms there) are duplicitous in practice.

In case of sexual harassment, the law is explicit that the word of the woman is sufficient to arrest the accused. A sexual harassment charge is criminal in nature, and the wheels of justice should have moved immediately; instead, the government formed a committee led by renowned boxer Mary Kom to probe the allegations. This could have been justified if intent of the government was to get to the bottom of the matter to cleanse the system, and put things in order so that no women athlete would face the same ignominy in future. Unfortunately, the intent was to find a political solution. The strategy did not work, and it is not surprising that the athletes are unhappy with the conduct of the Union government.

The Union government has further exposed itself by not making public the findings of the committee report, which was submitted in first week of April. Babita Phogat, a member of the committee, has alleged that she was not allowed to read the report, and that the report was snatched away from her before she could glance through. If true, this further increases the intentions of the government. If the government was serious about the problem, it should have not only published the report, but also acted by now.

Dissatisfied with the government’s response, the protesting wrestlers knocked on the Supreme Court’s door, where the Delhi Police unashamedly has said that if the court desired an FIR could be lodged the same day itself. It took four months and prodding from the top court for the Delhi Police to file two FIRs, both naming Singh.

It is obvious that the police is not interested in pursuing this case — but what is it that makes it so brazen?

Ideally, the police should have arrested Singh in January itself. But two things worked for him. One, he is a BJP MP who is supposedly very close to a powerful minister in the Union Cabinet. Two, he belongs to the politically-powerful community of the Rajputs. The Rajputs in Uttar Pradesh are very influential, and the BJP does not want to upset the community. Singh himself is a seasoned leader, and can impact electoral fortunes of the BJP in four/five Lok Sabha seats around Gonda district.

A third reason is that the Delhi Police is allegedly a compromised force. Many senior officers in it are either eyeing post-retirement sinecures or are those who toe the government’s ideological line without questioning. These police officers either do not take cognisance of complaints/cases against the ruling alliance, or when it does, it is not in a hurry to do its job.

A few years back when a few masked men and women unleashed violence in front of the TV cameras in JNU and later, when a few were identified as ABVP activists by a TV channel, the Delhi Police did precious little. More than a dozen Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs and leaders were arrested on frivolous charges. In most cases the courts were livid about the way the investigation was carried out. Most of them were exonerated by the courts. In the past, the police has not taken notice of the provocative statements made by BJP leaders such as Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma, and Kapil Mishra. Serious allegations were levelled against the Delhi Police during the 2020 Delhi riots in which 53 persons lost their lives (two-third of which were Muslims). During the investigations into the riots even lawyers who were helping the Muslim community were intimidated, and their houses were raided.

It is not surprising that the Delhi Police has not taken any action based on the wrestlers’ complaint. What is surprising is its audacity. Despite the apex court’s intervention, it is disinclined to arrest Singh. This is not possible unless the Delhi Police has clear instructions from up the hierarchy. Is it a coincidence that the Delhi Police reports to the Union government and Amit Shah is the Home Minister?

The men's national camp for free style and Greco-Roman wrestlers is held at the SAI centre in Bahalgarh (Sonepat) while the women's camp is organised in Lucknow.

The country's premier wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, have levelled sexual harassment allegations against Brij Bhushan and resumed their protest at Jantar Mantar on April 23.

The national camp was closed on April 8, a day before the Asian Championship in Astana, Kazakhstan, and has not yet restarted.

More than 300 wrestlers in 10 weight categories -- senior, junior, cadet and U-15 -- train at the SAI Centre in Sonepat while the Lucknow centre accommodates more than 100 women wrestlers.

""I don't have proper sparring partners with me to train. We need to be in national camp. The Asian Games trials are just two months away. The SAI should restart the camp. Why should the junior wrestlers suffer,"" Narsingh Pancham Yadav said from Mumbai.

""There are about 25 wrestlers where I train and most of them are junior. So obviously I don't have proper training partners. They are inexperienced. Not much time is left for Asian Games and after that, the World Championship is also scheduled. The national camp must restart,"" said the national championship silver medallist.

Asked about the ongoing protest by the top wresters, Narsingh said, ""I don't know the truth. If something like that (sexual harassment) has happened, then it's wrong.""

Sandeep Deshwal, who competes in Greco-Roman style in 82kg category, also said it has been a struggle for him since the national camp shut.

""I am in Rohtak since the camp closed. It's really difficult. I have spoken to the coaches also several times but no one knows why the national camp is not restarting.""

National Greco-Roman coach Hargobind Singh also appeared clueless.

""I have spoken to SAI officials multiple times but have not got a definitive answer. A lot of time has passed since the Asian Championship in Astana (April 9-14). By this time the camp should have resumed,"" said Hargobind.

""It's an Asian Games year and there should not be this big a gap in training,"" he added.

The Indian wrestlers had won 14 medals at the Asian Championship with the women winning seven of them.

While Bajrang Punia, Ravi Dahiya (injury) and Vinesh Phogat chose not to compete in Astana, other prominent wrestlers, like Deepak Punia and Sarita Mor, who are World Championships medallists, could not win a medal.

Lalita Sharma, the executive director at SAI Sonpeat centre, said they have ""not received any communication regarding the national camp as of now"".

The PTI tried to reach out to SAI DG Sandip Pradhan but several calls to him went unanswered. He also did not respond to messages.

Meanwhile, a woman wrestler said unless there is clarity she won't like to join the national camp.

""I am doing fine at my training centre. There has to be clarity who the coaches will be at the camp and who do we need to reach out to, in case there is an issue. Wrestling is as much mental as physical. In the current scenario, it's difficult to say anything if I would like to rejoin the camp.

""If the camp resumes at Lucknow centre only, then it should be fine but if it's shifted to some other place, we need to get clarity on a few things. Otherwise also not many women wrestlers join the camp, most of them prefer to train at their own training centres,"" she said.","The men's national camp for free style and Greco-Roman wrestlers is held at the SAI centre in Bahalgarh (Sonepat) while the women's camp is organised in Lucknow.

Vinesh, the biggest face of the wrestlers' protest, claimed that sexual harassment cases were reported twice in the past during the national camp, but the WFI succeeded in sweeping the matter under the carpet.

The World championship medallist said the complainants had shared their ordeal in a meeting with the Sports Minister, but he did not do anything except for constituting an oversight panel. The wrestlers had called off their protest in January after getting assurances from the government that the matter would be probed, and a five-member panel was formed to look into the allegations of sexual harassment against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

""During the 2012 national camp, a sexual harassment complaint was lodged at a police station. Within 24 hours that case was hushed up. In 2014, a physio, who was also trainer of Geeta Phogat, raised a similar matter and he was removed from the camp within 24 hours. From that day, his wife could not participate in any competition,"" Vinesh said.

""Before we started our protest, three months back, we had explained everything to a government official how sexual harassment was taking place and how women wrestlers were being tortured mentally. The athletes were being pushed to a stage where they could have done anything with their lives,"" she added.

She continued, ""We waited for three-four months but when nothing happened, we came to Jantar Mantar. When we met the sports minister, the women wrestlers shared individual incidents related to sexual harassment. The girls were crying before him but no action was taken at that time.""

""Sports Minister tried to hush up matter yet again by forming a committee. We have tried to raise this issue at every level but the matter was always suppressed,"" said Vinesh.

The Asian Games gold medallist also opined that people could now understand why they were silent for 12 years. ""We had to play sport. Our career, life was at stake and that's why we could not muster enough courage. Now we have reached a stage in our careers where we could speak. It's not easy to stand against a powerful man,"" she said.

Sakshi Malik refuted allegations that the protests were a means to claim exemption from wrestling trials. Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty Images

Sakshi Malik said the motive behind the protest, as being projected, was not to seek exemptions from trials. She claimed she was asked to appear in a trial abroad when she had already won a trial in India. Another girl, in 2012, was asked to reappear in a trial within 24 hours of winning.

""She was vomiting during the retrial bouts. I had told her that we do not have status to fight with these men,"" added Vinesh.

Vinesh also alleged that the Delhi Police was not doing its job properly.

""The Delhi Police has not yet recorded any statement. They are helping in breaking the victims, using power and position. Delhi Police is trying to delay the matter. They are giving information to Brij Bhushan. Maybe we will get justice only from the Supreme Court.""

""The kind of language he (WFI chief) is using on national television gives an indication how he can behave with women in a closed room. If he wants a fair probe, he should himself go to the police station, get himself arrested and co-operate with police in probe. After that if nothing comes out, we should be held guilty,"" said Vinesh, who added that she has not met Brij Bhushan in the last two years.

Bajrang Punia also claimed that they have support of many wrestlers, but they do not want to disturb their training, and that is why not many are at the protest site.","Vinesh Phogat has alleged that complaints related to sexual harassment have been hushed up in the past by the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and that Sports Minister Anurag Thakur did the same by forming an oversight panel instead of taking concrete action.

The wrestlers are continuously protesting against sexual harassment charges against the WFI chief and are demanding his arrest. While addressing the media, Olympian Vinesh said, ""It is very difficult to stand against a person who is misusing his power and position for so long.""

She further revealed that the wrestlers had met an official before they started their protest in Jantar Mantar, for the first time. But, no action was taken.

She said, “Three-Four months before we sat at Jantar Mantar, we had met an official, we had told him everything that how women athletes are sexually harassed and mentally tortured when no action was taken, then we sat on Dharna.""

She also slammed Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur for not taking any action and suppressing the matter by forming a committee.

""We ended our protest after talking to Union Sports Minister (Anurag Thakur), and all the athletes had told him about the sexual harassment. He by forming a committee tried to suppress the matter there; no action was taken that time,"" She said.

Bajrang Punia addressed the allegations that they are protesting against new rules introduced for the Olympics.

He said, ""He (Brij Bhusan) is saying that we have made some rules for the Olympics and therefore these athletes are protesting; firstly, this is not about the Olympics, this is against sexual harassment. And if I talk about the Olympic rule; the federation will take trails of athletes coming from the Olympics, whoever they want.""

Earlier on Monday, Brij Bhushan Shran Singh said that he would resign ‘if his party asked him to’. In an interview with ANI, he said, “If my party asks me to resign, I will resign...Forces involved in 'Tukde Tukde gang', Shaheen Bagh, 'Kisaan Andolan' seem to be involved in it (Wrestlers' protest), I am not their target, party (BJP ) is their target, these athletes are paid. Protest is expanding like Shaheen Bagh, they want to divide UP and Haryana."" He also alleged that wrestler Bajrang Punia had asked someone to “arrange a girl"" in order to level sexual harassment charges under the POCSO act.

Earlier on Saturday, the WFI chief asserted that if he resigns from his post it would mean that he has accepted the allegations which have been raised by the wrestlers. Reacting to World Wrestling Federation Chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh's remark she said that all they wanted was justice.

The Delhi Police on Friday registered two FIRs against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment and exploitation of female wrestlers by him. He also said that 90 per cent of Haryana players stand with him while only one wrestling family continues to protest at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi.Earlier on April 26, Wrestlers held a candle march at Jantar Mantar urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their 'Mann Ki Baat'.

While talking to the media, Sakshee said, ""We urge PM Modi to listen to our Mann Ki Baat. Even Smriti Irani ji is not listening to us. We are trying to show them the light through this candle march,"" said Sakshee to the media.

Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist wrestler Bajrang Punia and star wrestlers like Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik on Friday said that they will continue their protest against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh until he is sent behind bars.

Top Indian grapplers such as Vinesh Phogat, Sakshee Malikkh, Bajrang Punia, and many others wrestlers are involved in the protest against the WFI chief. Over the last six days, the wrestlers have slept and trained at the protest site near Jantar Mantar in the national capital.

New Delhi, May 2

Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik have accepted that the fight to get justice in the sexual harassment case against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh would be a long-drawn-out affair. The protesting wrestlers said they have decided to put the other charges, including financial irregularities against the WFI, on the back burner because the issue of female athletes’ safety is paramount.

Our sport tests us both mentally and physically. The struggle and anxiety before a competition is very different. We do not have the same feeling here. This is no struggle. We are fighting for justice. Sakshi Malik

The wrestlers once again questioned why Singh has not yet been called in for questioning, especially when one of the alleged offences is abusing a minor. The Delhi Police had registered two FIRs on April 28.

“The Delhi Police have not done anything so far,” Bajrang said.

Sakshi said: “The victims’ statements are yet to be recorded. What kind of an investigation is this? Brij Bhushan is yet to be summoned.”

The duo said that training for the Asian Games was not even on their minds currently. “Brij Bhushan has retired us already, and we are ready to sacrifice everything to get justice,” Bajrang said. “We know that till the time either he or his people are in the federation we will not be allowed to compete. So we want a complete clean-up of the body. Singh and his people should leave,” he added.

‘Usha, Mary are politicians’

Sakshi and Bajrang said that they were hurt by the comments of former sprinter PT Usha, who in her new avatar as the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president criticised the wrestlers for continuing the protest. IOA joint secretary Kalyan Chaubey had alluded that the protest was harming the country’s image.

“We are much better than people like Mary Kom and PT Usha,” Sakshi said. “If former athletes such as them do not support us, it’s a matter of shame. We do not want them to sit here with us. We just want them to support us,” she added.

“I have been hearing since my childhood that politicians cannot be trusted as they turn on their families. They (Usha and Mary) have proved it. These are the people I grew up watching and aspired to become, but I have learnt my lessons the hard way,” the Rio Olympics bronze medal winner added.

Bajrang said: “PT Usha must realise that she got this position because of her sports achievements, but she has become a politician now.”

In the ongoing polls, the BJP has given all the party MPs and MLAs from the state tasks related to the campaign such as holding of public meetings and running door-to-door programmes in support of their candidates.

Singh is the only MP, sources said, who has stayed away from the party’s campaign in the elections.

Sources said that after the fresh round of controversy Singh stopped attending political programmes. The last political event he attended was a meeting of the BJP’s Awadh region at the party’s state headquarters in Lucknow on April 25 on the civic body poll preparations, two days after the agitating wrestlers returned to Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.

Straddling the districts of Gonda and Bahraich, the Kaiserganj Lok Sabha constituency comprises several nagar palikas and nagar panchayats.

Having skipped the campaign, Singh on Tuesday in a video message appealed to the voters from Gonda, Bahraich and Balrampur districts to vote for the BJP candidates. The WFI chief said that he could not meet the voters directly since he was going through a “rough patch” following a conspiracy hatched against him.

A BJP leader at the party’s state headquarters said that all the party MPs were asked to do canvassing for candidates, but Singh did not. A party functionary in Bahraich said the local unit did not invite him for the campaign. “Singh’s supporters are candidates from several seats on BJP tickets. But he did not campaign for them as well,” he said.

Singh, however, meets people on a daily basis in Gonda where he has been camping. On Wednesday, a delegation of village pradhans led by Muslim clerics met the MP in Bahraich and extended support to him.

On April 30, Singh organised the screening of 100th episode of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann ki Baat’s radio message on an LCD screen on the campus of a college run by him. Same day, a group of sadhus from Ayodhya and Hastinapur (Nepal) met him in Gonda, extended their support to him over the controversy, assuring that they were ready to stage a sit-in at Jantar Mantar to “seek justice” for him.

Away from political activities, Singh in Gonda is following his daily routine of visiting a gaushala (cowshed), a stable and a gymnasium besides attending weddings and other family functions of his supporters.

Speaking to The Indian Express, the MP said, “I am staying away from the campaign for the urban local body polls and political programmes because of the ongoing controversy and allegations. But I have issued appeal to the voters.”

All the sections of society were supporting him, he claimed.

The manner in which this episode has played out raises doubts over the BJP leadership having such an iron grip over the party as is believed

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh epitomises everything that is wrong with India’s politics and sports management. The ruling BJP’s steadfast refusal to take prompt action against the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) is indicative of the duplicity of the leadership. Despite the seriousness of the charges and the protests since January, the government dragged its feet on the matter. The ruling party’s leadership chose not to act on at least three occasions to swiftly end this controversy and secure justice for women wrestlers who accused Mr B.B.S. Singh of sexual molestation.

First, the BJP leadership chose not put pressure on the accused to step down from the post -- eventually appointing, last week, an ad-hoc committee to run the WFI’s affairs. Second, the Delhi police inexcusably delayed filing a first information report (FIR), finally doing so only after the Supreme Court’s directive. Third and last, the police did not move with the swiftness it has shown in several parts of India while acting against political adversaries and communities whose loyalties are considered “suspect”. This lends credence to the allegation, levelled most recently after Rahul Gandhi’s conviction for defamation, that the same laws apply differently to people depending on their identity.

The response of the ruling party and the government so far exposes the disingenuousness of slogans and campaigns like “Beti Bachao, Beti Padao” and the idea of “selfie with daughter”, a call for which was given during an earlier episode of Mann Ki Baat. This is not the first time that the party and its leadership failed to promptly walk the talk. Earlier too, there was a much-publicised incident involving a senior Haryana BJP leader’s son who stalked a radio jockey while she was returning from work after dark in Chandigarh. Back then, several BJP leaders defended the young man by contending that the girl exposed herself to danger by being out of home alone at night.

All programmes and statements regarding promoting the girl child and providing equal opportunities come to a naught if transparent investigations are not launched against those alleged to have committed crimes against women. By not ensuring that the law took its course, the BJP and government opened themselves to the grave accusation that it was shielding the accused.

The manner in which this episode has played out raises doubts over the BJP leadership having such an iron grip over the party as is believed. This is true of the central leadership including the Prime Minister, as well as the state leadership, the chief minister included. It has been pointed out that Mr B.B.S. Singh is necessary for the BJP’s future electoral runs in almost a dozen eastern Uttar Pradesh parliamentary constituencies. If this is indeed true, it would mean that the verdicts in 2014 and 2019 were not chiefly the outcome of the popularity of Prime Minister Modi and Yogi Adityanath to some extent.

The failure of the BJP to act against Mr B.B.S. Singh, and also of the Samajwadi Party to not lend support to the agitating wrestlers, is an indication that the “bahubali” model of Indian politics, in which parties hands out tickets to a few mafia dons in return for safe passage in more constituencies, still thrives in India despite lip service by parties. This is a harsh reality despite the claims of the BJP central and state leadership that it has eliminated goons, drastically reduced crime and marginalised gang lords. That Mr B.B.S. Singh is still politically thriving despite his past gives rise to an elementary question: are political leaders with criminal backgrounds and continuing involvement with the underworld from just one community being marginalised?

It’s a grave tragedy that Mr B.B.S. Singh is being handled with kid gloves even after three decades of being known as a leading light of the criminal-politician tribe. The BJP had given him the first electoral nomination in 1991 from Gonda for the tenth Lok Sabha, the political coming of age for the party in UP -- it won a majority in the Assembly and secured 51 Lok Sabha seats. Significantly, Mr B.B.S. Singh in this election represented the so-assumed plebeians as against the sitting Congress MP, Anand Singh, a local “royal”. The rivalry between the two spilled over to the subsequent elections, although in 1996, Mr B.B.S. Singh was represented by his proxy -- wife Ketki Devi Singh -- because of TADA cases due to allegations of having sheltered the shooters of the D-Company.

Significantly, by 1996, Anand Singh had crossed over to the Samajwadi Party. In the next polls that followed in 1998, Anand Singh’s son, Kirti Vardhan Singh, entered the fray also as an SP candidate and defeated Mr B.B.S. Singh, a verdict that was reversed in 1999. Importantly, Kirti Vardhan Singh is now a BJP MP from his old constituency Gonda, while r B.B.S. Singh represents Kaisarganj. Importantly, all three political leaders, the father-son duo and Mr B.B.S. Singh, have been in the SP too at different points -- the father was once a minister in the government formed after the party’s victory in 2012. This was the reason why Mr B.B.S. Singh was confident that Akhilesh Yadav would not lend his name to the agitators against him.

Not insignificantly, Mr B.B.S. Singh crossed over from the BJP to the SP while a Lok Sabha MP in July 2008 under a cloud of allegations to bail out the UPA government and support it in the vote of confidence necessitated after the Left parties withdrew support due to the India-US nuclear deal. Despite his expulsion on charges of violating the party whip and allegation of involvement in the cash for votes, he was readmitted to the BJP in 2014 and has since been a member of the Lok Sabha. The ease

with which the three Singhs have been politically mobile underscores the limitations of all-popular central leaders or electoral mascots. It is evident that despite perceived unprecedented popularity, if Mr Modi or even Mr Adityanath needs support of political leaders with questionable criminal records, they will get it. This demonstrates that the idiom of the campaign may have changed, but it has not dramatically altered how elections are won.

The final issue the episode highlights is that sports management in India remains in the hands of political leaders either ruling party members, or at least blessed by them. An old tradition in India, this was continued by the BJP, disproving its claim of being an agent of change and new ethos. Stray nominations -- P.T. Usha as IOA chief, for instance -- are made with a discreet message that loyalty is essential. Sportspersons require a study spine. Not many retain it after retirement.","First, the BJP leadership chose not put pressure on the accused to step down from the post -- eventually appointing, last week, an ad-hoc committee to run the WFI’s affairs.

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the BJP MP representing the constituency of Kaisarganj (Uttar Pradesh), is popular in his part of the country. He runs many educational institutions and must be doing countless favours to his constituents to get repeatedly elected. The BJP cannot afford to cross him, even as wrestlers who have won laurels at the Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games have accused him of sexual misconduct.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has consciously crossed the Laxman Rekha. He tweaked Bihar’s jail rules to hasten the release of Anand Mohan Singh, a gangster-turned-neta.

Had the MP been a member of the Samajwadi Party or any other Opposition party, there would have been no hesitation on the part of the double-engine government in arresting him immediately. If and when a politician wears a BJP badge, he becomes immune to the rule of law! The wrestlers have waited for three months already to know the substance of the findings of the Mary Kom-headed Oversight Committee formed by the Sports Ministry; the ministry has received the panel report, but not shared it with the complainants.

In sheer desperation, the wrestlers approached the Supreme Court. FIRs were finally lodged by the Delhi Police, the same police that had flown down to Bengaluru from Delhi in a mighty hurry to arrest Disha Ravi, the student activist who used to mobilise the youth to protect the environment.

Whenever any woman approaches the police with a complaint of molestation, official instructions are that an FIR be immediately recorded and the offender arrested. Departmental action is taken against officers who fail to do so. On the sound principle that women are not likely to submit false complaints when their own reputation and that of their family are involved, this caveat has been circulated to all law enforcers throughout the land. In the case of the women wrestlers, the compulsions were overwhelming. They were all nationally known and had each been congratulated by our Prime Minister when they won laurels in international competitions. The only contrarian factor that the police faced in this case was the status of the culprit as a BJP MP.

The delayed action by the police lends credence to the widely held belief in the country that the law can be ignored if the offender is fairly high up in the ruling party’s hierarchy. Many legislators of Opposition parties have been crossing over to the ruling party to escape ED and CBI inquiries.

If media reports are to be believed, a few years ago, Brij Bhushan had called teenaged girl wrestlers at a late-evening hour to his residence to be introduced to him. They had voiced their fears at that time itself. If this information is correct, why did the Sports Ministry not advise Brij Bhushan not to call girls to his residence and definitely not after dusk? Courts have stopped the police from summoning women to police stations at unearthly hours. Why can such rules not be applied to sports officials by the ministry?

Many sports bodies are headed by politicians. They know nothing or very little about the game but they crave the tangential benefits that accrue from the position. These include access to funds and foreign jaunts to attend important contests and international meetings. If the BJP MP gets away with it, we can also include access to sportswomen as an add-on for those officials who are inclined to misbehave.

Modiji has stopped many malpractices in the government’s functioning. He should prohibit by law politicians from entering sports bodies. That would solve many problems, the most significant of which would be extricating party leaders from criminal prosecution. In the case of vote-catchers like Brij Bhushan, it is difficult for Modi to avoid a Hobson’s choice of losing credibility or losing votes. If the MP had not become the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) by fiat, Modi would have been saved the prospect of being “damned if he did the right thing and damned if he did not.”

The accused MP has blamed Congress leader from Haryana Deepender Hooda and wrestler Bajrang Punia for conspiring to nail him in this sexual molestation case. Would the women wrestlers have taken part in this ‘conspiracy’ at the cost of their own and their family’s reputation? I doubt it. And if he was so sure of his innocence, why did he muster local supporters and that too in droves, in a muscular show of strength?

PT Usha is a respected athlete and a mother figure in the world of sports. Hence, she was catapulted to the highest position in the Indian Olympic Association. She may have been a great sportswoman, but she obviously has not thought this issue through. And she may not be ready to take on the might of those who propelled her to the high office.

Another politician, now in the Opposition, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, has consciously crossed the Laxman Rekha. He tweaked Bihar’s jail rules to humour his newly minted colleague, Tejashwi Yadav, by hastening the release from jail of Anand Mohan Singh, a gangster-turned-neta hailing from the powerful Rajput community, who had been sentenced for life in jail for the murder of G Krishnaiah, District Magistrate of Gopalganj. Nitish has diminished himself in the public eye and can now bid adieu to any hope of being picked as the Opposition’s choice for Prime Minister in 2024.

Left liberals and other liberals in the country were shocked when Gujarat released prematurely 11 rapists-cum-murderers in the notorious case of Bilkis Bano. That immoral act helped the BJP win the Gujarat Assembly elections that followed the release. The release of Anand Mohan in Bihar may attract his community’s votes, but will it help to upset the BJP’s applecart in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections? I doubt it. Gujaratis and Biharis are different. Identical outcomes are not possible as cultures and attitudes differ.

The Supreme Court should intervene to lay down that 14/20/30 years of imprisonment are specifically prescribed while awarding a life sentence. And, more importantly, periods spent on parole should be excluded while computing the time spent in jail.","Julio RibeiroBrij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the BJP MP representing the constituency of Kaisarganj (Uttar Pradesh), is popular in his part of the country.

GURGAON: Notices sent to earlier to those with government jobs may have muted the show of support for the protest by leading wrestlers in Delhi’s Jantar Mantar against Wrestling Federation of Indian (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, but more from the sporting fraternity spoke out on Thursday.Some said they were also ready to join the fight for justice by the wrestlers, who have sought an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment against the WFI chief.Indian Olympian and Commonwealth Games gold-medalist in shooting, Manu Bhaker , told TOI on Thursday she believes there must be “something wrong” for some of the best wrestlers in the country to sit on a protest in Delhi.Bhaker, who is from Jhajjar, said she is currently preparing for the International Shooting Sport Federation ( ISSF ) World Cup. “Due to my ongoing camp, I am unable to join my fellow athletes at Jantar Mantar. Looking at the level they’ve been performing and winning medals for our country, I do not think that they are there missing their training for no reason. I believe something is going wrong and it needs to be stopped for the good,” she said.RK Hooda, retired general secretary of the Haryana Boxing Association, underlined that the protesting wrestlers are international-level sportspersons and medalists. “There must be a solid reason for a sportsperson to stay away from practice,” he said.Bhushan Saini, the general secretary of Gurgaon Boxing Association, said they were planning to meet coaches and boxers to decide the course of action. “Wrestlers have been wronged and we extend our heartfelt support to them,” he said. Some boxing trainees said they wanted to organise a rally in Panchkula to support the protesters. “If required, we will also respond to the call to reach Delhi and join the sit-in,” said a representative of the boxing trainees.On April 28, the Haryana government sent show-cause notices to wrestlers with jobs in departments such as police and railways through the sports quota. They were asked to explain their leave of absence in January, when the protest against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president first began.“You have been absent from work from January 18-20, when the wrestlers’ protest at Jantar Mantar began. You are directed to explain your absence along with proof. Failing to submit the documents will result in the department submitting a one-sided report against you to senior officials,” one such notice to the wrestlers in the police department reads.Wrestlers – including Olympian Sakshi Malik, and Asian Games and Commonwealth Games gold winner Vinesh Phogat – revived their protest at Jantar Mantar on April 23 against the WFI president.Malik is from Rohtak and Phogat from Bhiwani. A majority of Indian professional wrestlers on the international stage belongs to Haryana, where the sport has been passed down from generation to generation and is traditionally taught in akhadas across villages.","“Due to my ongoing camp, I am unable to join my fellow athletes at Jantar Mantar.

Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik on Tuesday took on the Indian Olympic Association top brass directly, slamming them for their comments and actions on not just the ongoing wrestlers’ protest but also the entire issue of sexual harassment in Indian sports.

“All of us come from ordinary backgrounds where even getting to watch sports on television was a big deal. When I started understanding sports for the first time and heard about P.T. Usha and her achievements, I always wondered if I could ever meet her. People like Usha, Sania Mirza, Sachin sir — they were the heroes we only saw on TV or heard about and always wondered if we would ever be able to meet them in person.

“We had heard of how politics changes people and destroys relations, now we are seeing that happen. If as a woman and the IOA president you cannot understand the problems of a female athlete, what will you do with such power and position?” Sakshi questioned, talking to select media, as their protest entered the 10th day.

“We were uncertain earlier but as the fight continues, the kind of things Usha said — and Mary Kom (Athletes Commission chairperson) hasn’t even bothered to comment — if such big stars of Indian sports cannot stand with us on such a serious issue, we feel we are 1000 times better and that’s what gives us strength,” she declared.

Asked about Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s allegations of the protest being political, Bajrang retorted that it would have been one if there were any demands or allegations that might benefit someone.

“We are not even talking about his corruption or administration, we are only talking of sexual harassment — how can that be political? This is not a difficult fight but the kind of things he and his people are doing to divert attention is wrong,” he said.

He also dared Singh to make any evidence he had against him public. “I want to tell him through the media to make it all public, we are not afraid. Yes I spoke of getting girls to talk — it is our responsibility to give courage and support those who want to speak up but are scared. There are seven complainants and he is trying to break them, sending money and threats to their families even though their identities are supposed to be secret, the Delhi Police is not doing anything.”

Sakshi added that so far neither had any girl been called for registering her statement nor any summons issued to Singh which puts a question mark on their fairness. “If we win this fight it will change the entire sporting ecosystem in India, will spare the next generation of all this and will be our payback to a sport that has given us everything,” she declared.

Asked if the wrestlers would consider ending their protest if the Supreme Court in its hearing on Friday assures them of monitoring the investigation, Bajrang was non-committal. “We will talk to our elders and our legal team and then decide because it is a court matter and they will know the best way forward,” he said.

Both Sakshi and Bajrang also acknowledged that their wrestling career was all but over now. “He (Singh) has already retired us and we also know that if he or his people continue to run the federation then there is nothing left for us. But I have played enough and at every major competition. But the youngsters coming up, they have their entire lives and careers ahead.

“That is also the reason we are asking everyone, even those who are supporting us, to come here. This is an important year in terms of competitions and we do not want their training or their future to be affected. We were prepared for the worst before we started out; what we did not expect was the kind of support he is getting,” Bajrang said.

Asked if this was the toughest fight of their careers, Sakshi laughed. “Not at all! Wrestling has a lot more struggle — before every competition, we go through a lot physically, mentally, and emotionally. That is a different level of struggle and feeling, that feeling has not even started here till now. We are fighting for a good cause, what’s the struggle in that,” she declared.","“All of us come from ordinary backgrounds where even getting to watch sports on television was a big deal.

On January 23, the day the Union Sports Ministry first formed the Mary Kom-led committee to investigate allegations of sexual harassment against Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Singh, it sent a letter to all national sports federations flagging the importance of the internal complaints committee (ICC).

While it noted that “most bodies have the necessary structures in place,” the letter called on sports federations to “re-examine their structures and policies” and make necessary changes to comply with the requirements of the PoSH law.

In fact, a functional ICC is one of the key conditions set up by the Ministry to grant annual recognition to the federations. Yet, as the investigation by The Indian Express shows, many are falling short.

The task is cut out, says Adille Sumariwalla, president of the Athletics Federation of India (AFI), the body with the largest membership and the highest women participation. While he declined to comment on the wrestlers’ allegations, he spoke to The Indian Express on how a functional ICC is “one of the most important things.”

“Not just having a committee, but also creating awareness for it. We have mechanisms in place right from U-14 categories and not just at senior levels,” he told The Indian Express in an interview.

Key to the process is awareness, he said. “Athletes don’t come to the office so putting this up on the office notice board doesn’t make sense. We have the details of the committee on our website and secondly, we organise awareness programmes at tournaments,” said Sumariwalla.

For example, at a recent inter-district tournament, 6,500 athletes took part and including parents, there were 10,000 people. “Three or four members of the committee were present there and held seminars for three days, educating junior athletes. And, wherever I go, I make it a point to talk about this along with anti-doping.”","In fact, a functional ICC is one of the key conditions set up by the Ministry to grant annual recognition to the federations.

Lucknow: Even as the...,2023-05-05 03:49:56+00:00,Does Brij Bhushan have plan B ready for himself?,"Lucknow: Even as the wrestlers’ controversy intensifies in Delhi and the BJP maintains an unexplained silence, the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh – the man in the eye of the storm – apparently has an option charted out for himself.

Singh, according to sources, is willing to cross over to the Samajwadi Party (SP) if the BJP initiates action against him.

He gave an indication to this effect last week when he praised SP president Akhilesh Yadav for not supporting the wrestlers who have been demanding action against him.

“Akhilesh knows the truth. I am being targetted for political reasons. All wrestlers come from a socialist background,” he had said.

The developments on this score have become clearer with the Samajwadi Party asking its media panellists not to “support or oppose” Singh in television debates.

As per the sources, the BJP is unwilling to take a decision on the controversy because it does not wish to upset the “apple cart” in eastern Uttar Pradesh where Singh wields considerable influence.

“Lok Sabha elections are just a few months away and Singh wields influence in at least six to seven Lok Sabha seats, The party has adopted a wait-and-watch attitude and we hope that the controversy will die down soon,” said a senior party functionary.

The Samajwadi Party, on the other hand, will be ready to welcome Singh into its fold if he does decide to join SP.

The SP does not have a Thakur leader of stature and after its relationship with independent legislator Raja Bhaiyya deteriorated, the party is facing a vacuum where Thakur leadership is concerned.

Incidentally, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who shared a warm rapport with Mulayam Singh Yadav, had joined SP in 2008 after being expelled from BJP for cross voting in favour of the UPA during a confidence motion.

He returned to BJP in 2013.

Returning to SP will now be smoother for him since his arch-rival and SP leader Vinod Singh a.k.a Pandit Singh is no more.

Besides, he has also been acquitted in the Babri demolition case for want of evidence.","Singh, according to sources, is willing to cross over to the Samajwadi Party (SP) if the BJP initiates action against him.

Phogat is among the wrestlers protesting at Jantar Mantar demanding the arrest of Singh, also a BJP MP, against whom seven women wrestlers have filed complaints of sexual harassment. The police have filed two separate FIRs.

“This needs to be overseen by the government, we have not stopped the national camps from happening. If the camps will be held in Lucknow, or the other areas of UP that are under Brij Bhushan’s control, we definitely have a problem. Anywhere else in India, we don’t mind. The young wrestlers need to continue their training and competitions,” Vinesh said.

Vinesh had previously said that she and the other protesting wrestlers, including Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik need to get back into shape, with the Asian Games and the Olympic qualification cycle fast approaching. They trained in New Delhi on Monday and Tuesday. “Fitness is down. Our bodies are swelling and getting dehydrated because we’re sitting here long hours. We need to build it back up, but a few days of consistent training will do that.”

On Saturday night, members of the wrestlers’ advisory committee met with representatives of the Sports Authority of India (SAI), including Director General Sandip Pradhan. Among their demands was a ban on any family members of Brij Bhushan’s involvement in the WFI going forward. Brijbhushan’s son, Karan Bhushan Singh, is the vice president of the WFI, and a member of its executive committee.

“We want the future of wrestlers to be secure. Once he’s gone, if someone just like him becomes the president, then how will anything change?” Vinesh said, adding that any experienced and qualified member of the “huge wrestling family in India” should be put in charge of the federation next after a thorough background check.

Tuesday was the 17th day of protests, but despite a huge show of support from farmers and khap leaders, who are assisting the wrestlers in making decisions regarding the protest, the numbers at Jantar Mantar saw a decline. Vinesh insisted, however, that the protest will not fizzle out soon, and that only big crowds are not indicative of the support they are receiving from across the country.

“It doesn’t matter how many people are sitting here. What matters is how people connect to this, which is coming through messages, social media posts, and other emotions,” she said.

Insisting that this is no longer an ‘agitation’, but instead a movement, Vinesh said that the reason why she feels so many women have connected to their protest is that in all fields across the country, they have had to face similar problems. “This a very long fight for the truth and to remind people of the reality. Go into corporates, sports, entertainment, or any industry, women are struggling with these issues,” she said.

“People should realise that even in sports, even at the very top level, these things happen. So this is a fight to get the truth out about the problems that women face everywhere. We would like them to come forward and share their stories and maybe if they couldn’t find justice, by joining us, they could.”

She added that she wishes this movement spreads throughout the country, rather than staying relevant in the northern states where wrestling is popular, and major support is coming from.

There is an acknowledgement that the protests may not come to an end any time soon as police conduct investigations after filing FIRs against Brij Bhushan. “If they arrest him today, we’ll leave. If they don’t, we could even be here for six months. So we will sit for however long we have to, it is in their hands how long this movement lasts,” Vinesh said.","National camps, trails and competitions must be held outside Uttar Pradesh, the home state of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, World Championship medallist Vinesh Phogat said.

The Wire,48:07.9,Wrestlers' Protest | Govt-Appointed Panel Was Biased Towards BJP MP Singh: Complainants,https://thewire.in/rights/wrestlers-protest-brij-bhushan-singh-mary-kom-oversight-committee,"... against Wrestling Federation of India chief and BJP MP, Brij Bhushan Singh, ... after the first round of protests by the wrestlers, against Singh.",None,Wrestlers' Protest | Govt-Appointed Panel Was Biased Towards BJP MP Singh: Complainants,"New Delhi: As wrestlers protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar for attention to serious allegations of sexual harassment against Wrestling Federation of India chief and BJP MP, Brij Bhushan Singh, complainants have said that the oversight committee appointed by the Union government is biased towards the accused, Economic Times reports.

The complainants in this case are seven wrestlers, including a minor athlete. The Delhi Police has filed an FIR against Singh only after the Supreme Court heard the wrestlers’ petition urging for an FIR to be registered.

The apex court asked that the identities of the complainants be kept under wraps considering the threat to their safety.

The Economic Times, which has claimed to have seen the FIR against Singh, noted in the report that the almost all the complainants, including the minor, believe that video recordings of the testimonies made before the committee may have been tampered with to protect the BJP MP.

This oversight committee had been set up in January, after the first round of protests by the wrestlers, against Singh.

Headed by boxing legend M.C. Mary Kom, the committee also has Olympic medallist Yogeshwar Dutt, Dhyanchand awardee Trupti Murgunde, SAI member Radhica Sreeman and ex-CEO, TOPS, retired Captain Rajesh Rajagopalan.

The committee was mandated to enquire into the allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment and/or intimidation, financial irregularities and administrative lapses, levelled by the prominent sportspersons and to complete the enquiry in four weeks.

The panel submitted its report last month to the Union government. It has since not been made public.

The wrestlers who had been part of the protests then and now – Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia and others – had said that they were not consulted when the government formed the oversight committee to look into their claims.

The ET report now mentions that in their FIR, almost all complainants repeated their lack of confidence in this committee. “They expressed ‘utter shock’ in their complaints that panel members tried to ‘justify the actions of the accused,’ Singh’s alleged acts were projected as nothing but ‘an act of innocence done in good faith’ by committee members and they implied that the complainant may have ‘interpreted’ the same ‘in a wrongful manner,’ one of the FIRs is learnt to read,” the report notes.

The report also says that the committee appeared to have already decided to favour Singh or act on his instructions and eventually gave him a clean chit.

Phogat is among the wrestlers protesting at Jantar Mantar demanding the arrest of Singh, also a BJP MP, against whom seven women wrestlers have filed complaints of sexual harassment. The police have filed two separate FIRs.

“This needs to be overseen by the government, we have not stopped the national camps from happening. If the camps will be held in Lucknow, or the other areas of UP that are under Brij Bhushan’s control, we definitely have a problem. Anywhere else in India, we don’t mind. The young wrestlers need to continue their training and competitions,” Vinesh said.

Vinesh had previously said that she and the other protesting wrestlers, including Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik need to get back into shape, with the Asian Games and the Olympic qualification cycle fast approaching. They trained in New Delhi on Monday and Tuesday. “Fitness is down. Our bodies are swelling and getting dehydrated because we’re sitting here long hours. We need to build it back up, but a few days of consistent training will do that.”

On Saturday night, members of the wrestlers’ advisory committee met with representatives of the Sports Authority of India (SAI), including Director General Sandip Pradhan. Among their demands was a ban on any family members of Brij Bhushan’s involvement in the WFI going forward. Brijbhushan’s son, Karan Bhushan Singh, is the vice president of the WFI, and a member of its executive committee.

“We want the future of wrestlers to be secure. Once he’s gone, if someone just like him becomes the president, then how will anything change?” Vinesh said, adding that any experienced and qualified member of the “huge wrestling family in India” should be put in charge of the federation next after a thorough background check.

HAWA president Rohtash Singh issued a letter suspending Virender Singh Dalal of Jhajjar, Sanjay Singh Malik of Hisar and Jai Bhagwan of Mewat, and termed their alleged involvement in the ongoing wrestling protest at the national capital as ""unethical"".

The HAWA chief said that ""all the three are still continuing their activities with the protesters, which is purely unethical and is against the objectives, rules and regulations of the WFI as well as HAWA.""

Rohtash's decision, however, brought to light the differences which have arisen within the HAWA, which is affiliated to WFI, with its general secretary Rakesh Singh calling the suspension of the district officials as a wrong move.

Rakesh claimed that the HAWA president has no power to suspend them.

The circumstances in which they (the three district officials) have been suspended are wrong and misleading, he said.

Rohtash had also issued another order banning Ajay Singh Dhanda and Jai Bhagwan Lathar, the managers of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Wrestling Academy in Mirchpur village of Hisar district. The president said that the academy and both the managers have been banned with immediate effect for allegedly playing a part in anti-HAWA and WFI activities.

Several wrestlers have been protesting at Jantar Mantar in Delhi since April 23, levelling charges of sexual harassment against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh.

The protesters have been demanding criminal action against Singh for alleged sexual harassment and intimidation of seven female wrestlers, including a minor.

The NFIW also expects appropriate immediate action from you as speaker of the Lok Sabha, and as a representative of the people to ""uphold women’s dignity and constitutional democratic rights"", to act immediately and effectively, so that women can regain some confidence in the criminal justice system, they said.

The NFIW leaders said the issues raised by the protesting wrestlers have been ignored by the government. This does not promote confidence of women either in the government or to trust and expect justice from the police, legal system and the Parliamentarians.

One FIR is registered under POCSO and is based on the sexual harassment and criminal intimidation complaint of a minor wrestler and the other FIR also arises from similar complaints of sexual harassment under the POSH Act, filed by other young women wresters, the NFIW leaders said.

Log kuchh bhi kahen, maine ek hatya ki hai (I have committed one murder in my life. Whatever people may say, I have committed one murder),” BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh told in an interview to news portal Lallantop in the run up to the 2022 Uttar Pradesh election.

The person the Kaiserganj MP referring to was Ranjit Singh who, he claimed, opened fire killing Ravinder Singh, the elder brother of late Samajwadi Party minister Vinod Singh alias Pandit Singh, in 1991.

Once childhood friends, Pandit Singh and Brij Bhushan were engaged in government contract work together, but later turned into business and political rivals. Singh died of Covid complications in 2021.

Despite the bold declaration, the BJP MP was tried in court but never convicted of murder.

A six-time MP, Brij Bhushan once faced as many as 38 cases against him under various charges including theft, rioting, murder, criminal intimidation, attempt to murder, kidnapping etc., all lodged between 1974 and 2007. He was also booked in a case under the UP Goondas Act and three more under the stringent Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act in that period, according to police records.

If his aides are to be believed, the BJP strongman was acquitted in all these cases. Sanjeev Singh, a representative of the Kaiserganj MP, told ThePrint that Brij Bhushan was acquitted in all 38 cases, while an appeal against acquittal from the trial court in one of the cases is pending in the Allahabad High Court.

Now, the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief stands accused of sexual harassment by several women wrestlers. A poster carrying a list of criminal cases lodged against Brij Bhushan hangs at the protest site in Delhi’s Jantar Mantar, where top wrestlers including Olympics medalists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia are demanding his arrest. Sources in the Gonda police confirmed the list of cases as genuine.

But Brij Bhushan’s election affidavit filed for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls states that there were only four cases pending against him back then and that he was acquitted in two. The two pending cases pertain to violations of the Model Code of Conduct. His aide Subhash Singh also said that the MP was not convicted in any of them.

“The 38 cases you are mentioning have finished after acquittal in each of them. Two of the four cases mentioned in the affidavit in 2019 have also ended. Two others are related to (model code of conduct violations) elections,” Brij Bhushan’s aide told ThePrint.

However, in the records of Nawabganj police station in Gonda — considered Brij Bhushan’s ‘fiefdom’ — he continues to be a history-sheeter. Nawabganj Station House Officer (SHO) Karunakar Pandey confirmed this to ThePrint, adding that the history-sheet was opened in the 1980s. The police station has a record of all the cases lodged — in Nawabganj, Gonda, Ayodhya and Delhi — against the BJP MP.

“He remains a history-sheeter, but we are no longer subjecting him to scrutiny (like other criminals). At our level, we have the power to open the history-sheet of a criminal, but only the court or an officer of the rank of superintendent of police or above, has the power to close it,” Pandey said.

“He has not been under police scrutiny ever since he became an MP. Our police force is a part of his security,” the SHO added.

ThePrint reached Brij Bhushan via calls and messages, but did not get a response. ThePrint also visited his Gonda residence on 2 May, but his aides said he would not give an interview.

According to Suraj Singh, the son of Ravinder Singh, “witnesses turning hostile” was the reason for his acquittal in several cases.

“He has been winning elections due to good luck and the influence that he enjoys. He not only has money but also the manpower, which was evident in the election that his son fought against me,” Suraj told ThePrint, referring to last year’s assembly polls in which he fought against Brij Bhushan’s son Prateek Bhushan Singh in Gonda.

Recounting the events in the run-up to the election, Suraj said, “Hundreds of wrestlers from across the country had arrived. He owns over 30 educational institutions, which are the source of his musclepower.”

Arms Act, Babri & attempt to murder

Among the cases previously lodged against Brij Bhushan is one under the Arms Act, filed at Gonda’s Nawabganj police station in 1993, and an attempt to murder case lodged the same year where he was accused of opening fire at his fierce rival Vinod Singh alias Pandit Singh, a former Samajwadi Party minister and three-time legislator from Gonda.

In the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, Brij Bhushan disclosed in his affidavit that he had two cases lodged against him. One of them was the Babri Masjid demolition FIR registered in 1992 against karsevaks under IPC Sections 147 (rioting), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153a (promoting enmity), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship), 297 (trespassing on burial places, etc), 395 (dacoity) and 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt).

The second was the case of firing at Pandit Singh, for which an attempt to murder case was slapped on him.

Between the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, there were two more cases lodged against Brij Bhushan. The first one was during the 2014 polls under IPC Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 171H (illegal payments in connection with an election) when Brij Bhushan was accused of distributing money among students and the public at Ayodhya’s Asharfi Bhawan crossing. His supporters were accused of raising slogans, flashing weapons and throwing liquor bottles on the streets.

The same year, another case was lodged against Brij Bhushan for violation of the model code of conduct under IPC Section 188 (illegal payments in connection with an election) and 341 (wrongful restraint), according to the 2019 poll affidavit.

‘The one murder’

In the Lallantop interview, Brij Bhushan says he killed Ranjit Singh, who along with others had allegedly opened fire during a panchayat meeting in 1991.

Narrating the sequence of the events in the interview, he says that Ravinder Singh, who was his partner in one of his businesses, was at the panchayat, despite his disapproval.

Brij Bhushan goes on to say that, while he was interacting with a person at the panchayat, gunshots were fired in the air by Ranjit Singh, one of which hit Ravinder Singh, killing him on the spot. It is after this, Brij Bhushan says in the interview, that he shot Ranjit Singh and subsequently there was heavy cross-firing from both ends. This, he says, was the one murder he has committed in his life.

But, Ravinder Singh’s son Suraj, quoted earlier, recounted a different sequence of events that unfolded on the day of the incident.

“My mother was pregnant with me when my father was killed. But from what I have heard from my relatives and friends, Kinker Singh had fired in the air first from the opposite side. Two persons were killed from both sides, including my father,” he told ThePrint.

“Ranjit Singh was killed in crossfire from the group accompanying my father,” Suraj added, refusing to acknowledge that Brij Bhushan really killed his father’s killer.

In 1993, an incident of firing at Pandit Singh — in which Brij Bhushan was one of the accused according to police records — changed the equation between the two families forever.

A group of assailants had reportedly sprayed bullets at Pandit Singh while he was at his Ballipur residence. Pandit Singh suffered several gunshots and was airlifted by the Mulayam Singh government to a Lucknow hospital, leading to a miraculous escape from death.

But the case remained pending for 30 years. Insiders hinted at an understanding between the families of Pandit Singh and Brij Bhushan.

“After Brij Bhushan joined the Samajwadi Party in 2008, late former CM Mulayam Singh brokered a compromise between the two families. Even as the trial continued, no member of Pandit Singh’s family could testify,” an SP leader from Gonda told ThePrint.

“Pandit Singh died of Covid in May 2021, but till then, he himself had not testified in the case,” the leader added.

Speaking to ThePrint, Suraj asserted that after Pandit’s death, his other uncle Narendra Singh testified in court against Brij Bhushan in September 2021, stating that it was he who fired at Pandit Singh.

Narendra had also claimed that he faced a threat to life from Brij Bhushan in the court, he added. In December 2022, however, Brij Bhushan and two others were acquitted in the case. In several interviews, Brij Bhushan has claimed that he was framed due to political vendetta.

Meanwhile, Suraj told ThePrint that they moved the Allahabad High Court contesting the acquittal verdict of the MP/MLA court of Gonda and that they hope to get justice from the high court.

The Ghanshyam Shukla case

The most sensational case in which Brij Bhushan was accused of having a role, but remained inconclusive, was the suspicious death of former BJP MLA Ghanshyam Shukla in April 2004. According to news reports, former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had called Brij Bhushan and asserted, “Marva diya (you got him killed).”

Shukla had replaced Brij Bhushan as the BJP’s candidate in 2004.

While Shukla’s wife Nandita Shukla alleged conspiracy and termed the death a murder, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a final report — a precursor to the closure report in the case.

Nandita, a former SP MLA, told ThePrint that the case remained inconclusive. “We got a notice from the court a few years back and the result was zero (the case remains inconclusive),” she said, refusing to talk further.

‘Land mafia link’

In January this year, Brij Bhushan’s representative Sanjeev Singh and his nephew Sumit Bhushan landed in a controversy after which an FIR was lodged at Gonda’s Kotwali police station against Sumit for his alleged role in forcibly taking possession of government land.

On 31 January, the Joint Advocate Federation of Devipatan Mandal, led by its president, lawyer Ravi Prakash Pandey, protested against Brij Bhushan and his aides. The Mandal also issued a memorandum addressed to the prime minister, the UP chief minister, the Union home minister and the Lok Sabha chairman, alleging that the land mafia was freely working under the patronage of Brij Bhushan’s representative Sanjeev Singh.

“Leader of land mafia Khaleel Tyrewala, who once used to repair vehicles, has been taking forced possession of Nazul, Waqf land, ponds and drains and has been resorting to the sale of plots here. He has the patronage of the Kaiserganj MP’s representative Sanjeev Singh,” reads the memorandum, seen by ThePrint.

Days later, on 3 February, the administration’s bulldozers brought down 8-ft-high walls erected on nazul land, at a distance of 100 m from the Gonda district magistrate’s office.

Next day, an FIR was lodged by the nazul land inspector against Brij Bhushan’s nephew Sumit Bhushan and seven others, which stated that the “land was registered by some persons against the name of Dakshaini Enterprises headed by Sumit Bhushan ‘without rightful authority’ and the same was ‘against law’”.

The FIR, seen by ThePrint, was lodged in Kotwali police station under IPC sections for impersonation, cheating, forgery, etc.

“The government had set up a special investigative team to probe the fraudulent land deals and plotting that has happened in Gonda over the past several years in connivance with district lawyers. That inquiry is still ongoing,” lawyer Pandey said.

Speaking to ThePrint, a senior police officer who has served in Gonda informed that four lawyers are currently in jail in this connection while one is absconding. “The investigation continues to be pending with the state SIT,” the officer added.

Asked about the allegations against Sanjeev Singh and Sumit Bhushan, Brij Bhushan’s aide Subhash Singh said the MP has not been named in any FIR related to the duo.

When ThePrint contacted Sanjeev Singh, for a comment on his alleged links with the land mafia, he said the case lodged related to nazul land is pending in the trial court.

“The land deal has been made after payment of stamp duty and without any coercion on sellers. Some of the accused have got anticipatory bail and others have got stay on arrest,” he said, claiming that there has been no cheating.

The government, however, has put a board on the land stating that the plot is nazul land and belongs to the government and taking possession of it is a criminal offence.

According to latest reports, the Haryana Amateur Wrestling Association (HAWA), which is connected to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), has recently suspended three of its members from the organisation for allegedly agitating against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

New Delhi/Rohtak, May 7

Amid the swelling of support for the wrestlers at Jantar Mantar, the protesters today set May 21 as deadline for the government to arrest Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the embattled Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief facing allegations of sexual exploitation of women grapplers.

The 14-day ultimatum came hours after the government formally opened up talks with the wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, who have been sitting on a dharna for 15 days. Led by Sports Authority of India (SAI) Director General Sandip Pradhan, a two-member delegation of the Sports Ministry met the representatives of the wrestlers last night at the protest site. Bajrang, Vinesh and Sakshi, however, did not meet the delegation, leaving the meeting to its nine-member committee of coaches and former players to put forward their demands. Pradhan, however, met Bajrang for a brief period. “Pradhan said the wrestlers were like his children, to which Bajrang replied ‘you remembered us after 15 days’,” a source said, confirming the meeting. The committee put forward two demands: Brij Bhushan should be arrested and no one from his family should be involved in running the WFI affairs.

The representatives of several farm unions, including Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and Punjab’s BKU (Ugrahan-women), and more than 100 khap panchayats from Haryana, UP, Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand held a meeting at the protest site and extended support to the wrestlers. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, Khap Maham 24 chief Mehar Singh and Baldev Singh Sirsa of the SKM (non-political) joined the wrestlers on the dais and addressed the media. “The government should prepare for a long haul. We will not back down until the wrestlers get justice. Members from each khap will join the protest daily and return home by the evening,” Tikait said, adding the wrestlers’ advisory committee would take care of the protest while the unions would extend outside support.

Asked if the protest had been hijacked by farm unions and political parties, Tikait said, “The players are leading... we are only supporting.”

Insisting that their protest had not been hijacked by anyone, Vinesh hinted that the protest may become bigger if their demands were not met. “People have joined us in our fight against injustice. They respect us and care for our dignity,” she said.

BKU-Ekta Ugrahan chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan said they would burn effigies of Brij Bhushan throughout the country from May 11-18.

Surendra Singh Solanki, chief of Palam Khap 360, a leading khap of Delhi, said, “If the WFI chief is not arrested, we have scheduled a meeting for May 21 at Meham in Rohtak (Haryana) to devise our next strategy.” Om Prakash Dhankar, coordinator of Sarv Khap Panchayat, said they would carry out a campaign from May 11-16 in Haryana to muster public support for the agitation.

Brij Bhushan, BJP MP from Kaiserganj (UP), urged farmer leaders not to make the “mistake” and instead wait for the outcome of the probe into the allegations against him. In a video, he claimed he was innocent and alleged he was targeted as he had brought reforms in the selection process for wrestlers.

As hundreds of turbaned farmers were seen at the protest site, the scenes were similar to the farm stir that continued for 13 months until the Centre repealed the three farm laws. Anticipating a large gathering, security arrangements were beefed up in advance at Jantar Mantar.

Barricades breached

Jhajjar: Stopped at the Tikri border, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) activists breached barricades. However, a police official said 10 buses and four cars, carrying over 500 persons, were allowed to go.

Log kuchh bhi kahen, maine ek hatya ki hai (I have committed one murder in my life. Whatever people may say, I have committed one murder),” BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh told in an interview to news portal Lallantop in the run up to the 2022 Uttar Pradesh election.

The person the Kaiserganj MP referring to was Ranjit Singh who, he claimed, opened fire killing Ravinder Singh, the elder brother of late Samajwadi Party minister Vinod Singh alias Pandit Singh, in 1991.

Once childhood friends, Pandit Singh and Brij Bhushan were engaged in government contract work together, but later turned into business and political rivals. Singh died of Covid complications in 2021.

Despite the bold declaration, the BJP MP was tried in court but never convicted of murder.

A six-time MP, Brij Bhushan once faced as many as 38 cases against him under various charges including theft, rioting, murder, criminal intimidation, attempt to murder, kidnapping etc., all lodged between 1974 and 2007. He was also booked in a case under the UP Goondas Act and three more under the stringent Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act in that period, according to police records.

If his aides are to be believed, the BJP strongman was acquitted in all these cases. Sanjeev Singh, a representative of the Kaiserganj MP, told ThePrint that Brij Bhushan was acquitted in all 38 cases, while an appeal against acquittal from the trial court in one of the cases is pending in the Allahabad High Court.

Now, the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief stands accused of sexual harassment by several women wrestlers. A poster carrying a list of criminal cases lodged against Brij Bhushan hangs at the protest site in Delhi’s Jantar Mantar, where top wrestlers including Olympics medalists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia are demanding his arrest. Sources in the Gonda police confirmed the list of cases as genuine.

But Brij Bhushan’s election affidavit filed for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls states that there were only four cases pending against him back then and that he was acquitted in two. The two pending cases pertain to violations of the Model Code of Conduct. His aide Subhash Singh also said that the MP was not convicted in any of them.

“The 38 cases you are mentioning have finished after acquittal in each of them. Two of the four cases mentioned in the affidavit in 2019 have also ended. Two others are related to (model code of conduct violations) elections,” Brij Bhushan’s aide told ThePrint.

However, in the records of Nawabganj police station in Gonda — considered Brij Bhushan’s ‘fiefdom’ — he continues to be a history-sheeter. Nawabganj Station House Officer (SHO) Karunakar Pandey confirmed this to ThePrint, adding that the history-sheet was opened in the 1980s. The police station has a record of all the cases lodged — in Nawabganj, Gonda, Ayodhya and Delhi — against the BJP MP.

“He remains a history-sheeter, but we are no longer subjecting him to scrutiny (like other criminals). At our level, we have the power to open the history-sheet of a criminal, but only the court or an officer of the rank of superintendent of police or above, has the power to close it,” Pandey said.

“He has not been under police scrutiny ever since he became an MP. Our police force is a part of his security,” the SHO added.

ThePrint reached Brij Bhushan via calls and messages, but did not get a response. ThePrint also visited his Gonda residence on 2 May, but his aides said he would not give an interview.

According to Suraj Singh, the son of Ravinder Singh, “witnesses turning hostile” was the reason for his acquittal in several cases.

“He has been winning elections due to good luck and the influence that he enjoys. He not only has money but also the manpower, which was evident in the election that his son fought against me,” Suraj told ThePrint, referring to last year’s assembly polls in which he fought against Brij Bhushan’s son Prateek Bhushan Singh in Gonda.

Recounting the events in the run-up to the election, Suraj said, “Hundreds of wrestlers from across the country had arrived. He owns over 30 educational institutions, which are the source of his musclepower.”

Arms Act, Babri & attempt to murder

Among the cases previously lodged against Brij Bhushan is one under the Arms Act, filed at Gonda’s Nawabganj police station in 1993, and an attempt to murder case lodged the same year where he was accused of opening fire at his fierce rival Vinod Singh alias Pandit Singh, a former Samajwadi Party minister and three-time legislator from Gonda.

In the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, Brij Bhushan disclosed in his affidavit that he had two cases lodged against him. One of them was the Babri Masjid demolition FIR registered in 1992 against karsevaks under IPC Sections 147 (rioting), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153a (promoting enmity), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship), 297 (trespassing on burial places, etc), 395 (dacoity) and 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt).

The second was the case of firing at Pandit Singh, for which an attempt to murder case was slapped on him.

Between the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, there were two more cases lodged against Brij Bhushan. The first one was during the 2014 polls under IPC Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 171H (illegal payments in connection with an election) when Brij Bhushan was accused of distributing money among students and the public at Ayodhya’s Asharfi Bhawan crossing. His supporters were accused of raising slogans, flashing weapons and throwing liquor bottles on the streets.

The same year, another case was lodged against Brij Bhushan for violation of the model code of conduct under IPC Section 188 (illegal payments in connection with an election) and 341 (wrongful restraint), according to the 2019 poll affidavit.

‘The one murder’

In the Lallantop interview, Brij Bhushan says he killed Ranjit Singh, who along with others had allegedly opened fire during a panchayat meeting in 1991.

Narrating the sequence of the events in the interview, he says that Ravinder Singh, who was his partner in one of his businesses, was at the panchayat, despite his disapproval.

Brij Bhushan goes on to say that, while he was interacting with a person at the panchayat, gunshots were fired in the air by Ranjit Singh, one of which hit Ravinder Singh, killing him on the spot. It is after this, Brij Bhushan says in the interview, that he shot Ranjit Singh and subsequently there was heavy cross-firing from both ends. This, he says, was the one murder he has committed in his life.

But, Ravinder Singh’s son Suraj, quoted earlier, recounted a different sequence of events that unfolded on the day of the incident.

“My mother was pregnant with me when my father was killed. But from what I have heard from my relatives and friends, Kinker Singh had fired in the air first from the opposite side. Two persons were killed from both sides, including my father,” he told ThePrint.

“Ranjit Singh was killed in crossfire from the group accompanying my father,” Suraj added, refusing to acknowledge that Brij Bhushan really killed his father’s killer.

In 1993, an incident of firing at Pandit Singh — in which Brij Bhushan was one of the accused according to police records — changed the equation between the two families forever.

A group of assailants had reportedly sprayed bullets at Pandit Singh while he was at his Ballipur residence. Pandit Singh suffered several gunshots and was airlifted by the Mulayam Singh government to a Lucknow hospital, leading to a miraculous escape from death.

But the case remained pending for 30 years. Insiders hinted at an understanding between the families of Pandit Singh and Brij Bhushan.

“After Brij Bhushan joined the Samajwadi Party in 2008, late former CM Mulayam Singh brokered a compromise between the two families. Even as the trial continued, no member of Pandit Singh’s family could testify,” an SP leader from Gonda told ThePrint.

“Pandit Singh died of Covid in May 2021, but till then, he himself had not testified in the case,” the leader added.

Speaking to ThePrint, Suraj asserted that after Pandit’s death, his other uncle Narendra Singh testified in court against Brij Bhushan in September 2021, stating that it was he who fired at Pandit Singh.

Narendra had also claimed that he faced a threat to life from Brij Bhushan in the court, he added. In December 2022, however, Brij Bhushan and two others were acquitted in the case. In several interviews, Brij Bhushan has claimed that he was framed due to political vendetta.

Meanwhile, Suraj told ThePrint that they moved the Allahabad High Court contesting the acquittal verdict of the MP/MLA court of Gonda and that they hope to get justice from the high court.

The Ghanshyam Shukla case

The most sensational case in which Brij Bhushan was accused of having a role, but remained inconclusive, was the suspicious death of former BJP MLA Ghanshyam Shukla in April 2004. According to news reports, former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had called Brij Bhushan and asserted, “Marva diya (you got him killed).”

Shukla had replaced Brij Bhushan as the BJP’s candidate in 2004.

While Shukla’s wife Nandita Shukla alleged conspiracy and termed the death a murder, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a final report — a precursor to the closure report in the case.

Nandita, a former SP MLA, told ThePrint that the case remained inconclusive. “We got a notice from the court a few years back and the result was zero (the case remains inconclusive),” she said, refusing to talk further.

‘Land mafia link’

In January this year, Brij Bhushan’s representative Sanjeev Singh and his nephew Sumit Bhushan landed in a controversy after which an FIR was lodged at Gonda’s Kotwali police station against Sumit for his alleged role in forcibly taking possession of government land.

On 31 January, the Joint Advocate Federation of Devipatan Mandal, led by its president, lawyer Ravi Prakash Pandey, protested against Brij Bhushan and his aides. The Mandal also issued a memorandum addressed to the prime minister, the UP chief minister, the Union home minister and the Lok Sabha chairman, alleging that the land mafia was freely working under the patronage of Brij Bhushan’s representative Sanjeev Singh.

“Leader of land mafia Khaleel Tyrewala, who once used to repair vehicles, has been taking forced possession of Nazul, Waqf land, ponds and drains and has been resorting to the sale of plots here. He has the patronage of the Kaiserganj MP’s representative Sanjeev Singh,” reads the memorandum, seen by ThePrint.

Days later, on 3 February, the administration’s bulldozers brought down 8-ft-high walls erected on nazul land, at a distance of 100 m from the Gonda district magistrate’s office.

Next day, an FIR was lodged by the nazul land inspector against Brij Bhushan’s nephew Sumit Bhushan and seven others, which stated that the “land was registered by some persons against the name of Dakshaini Enterprises headed by Sumit Bhushan ‘without rightful authority’ and the same was ‘against law’”.

The FIR, seen by ThePrint, was lodged in Kotwali police station under IPC sections for impersonation, cheating, forgery, etc.

“The government had set up a special investigative team to probe the fraudulent land deals and plotting that has happened in Gonda over the past several years in connivance with district lawyers. That inquiry is still ongoing,” lawyer Pandey said.

Speaking to ThePrint, a senior police officer who has served in Gonda informed that four lawyers are currently in jail in this connection while one is absconding. “The investigation continues to be pending with the state SIT,” the officer added.

Asked about the allegations against Sanjeev Singh and Sumit Bhushan, Brij Bhushan’s aide Subhash Singh said the MP has not been named in any FIR related to the duo.

When ThePrint contacted Sanjeev Singh, for a comment on his alleged links with the land mafia, he said the case lodged related to nazul land is pending in the trial court.

“The land deal has been made after payment of stamp duty and without any coercion on sellers. Some of the accused have got anticipatory bail and others have got stay on arrest,” he said, claiming that there has been no cheating.

The government, however, has put a board on the land stating that the plot is nazul land and belongs to the government and taking possession of it is a criminal offence.

New Delhi/Rohtak, May 7

Amid the swelling of support for the wrestlers at Jantar Mantar, the protesters today set May 21 as deadline for the government to arrest Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the embattled Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief facing allegations of sexual exploitation of women grapplers.

The 14-day ultimatum came hours after the government formally opened up talks with the wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, who have been sitting on a dharna for 15 days. Led by Sports Authority of India (SAI) Director General Sandip Pradhan, a two-member delegation of the Sports Ministry met the representatives of the wrestlers last night at the protest site. Bajrang, Vinesh and Sakshi, however, did not meet the delegation, leaving the meeting to its nine-member committee of coaches and former players to put forward their demands. Pradhan, however, met Bajrang for a brief period. “Pradhan said the wrestlers were like his children, to which Bajrang replied ‘you remembered us after 15 days’,” a source said, confirming the meeting. The committee put forward two demands: Brij Bhushan should be arrested and no one from his family should be involved in running the WFI affairs.

The representatives of several farm unions, including Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and Punjab’s BKU (Ugrahan-women), and more than 100 khap panchayats from Haryana, UP, Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand held a meeting at the protest site and extended support to the wrestlers. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, Khap Maham 24 chief Mehar Singh and Baldev Singh Sirsa of the SKM (non-political) joined the wrestlers on the dais and addressed the media. “The government should prepare for a long haul. We will not back down until the wrestlers get justice. Members from each khap will join the protest daily and return home by the evening,” Tikait said, adding the wrestlers’ advisory committee would take care of the protest while the unions would extend outside support.

Asked if the protest had been hijacked by farm unions and political parties, Tikait said, “The players are leading... we are only supporting.”

Insisting that their protest had not been hijacked by anyone, Vinesh hinted that the protest may become bigger if their demands were not met. “People have joined us in our fight against injustice. They respect us and care for our dignity,” she said.

BKU-Ekta Ugrahan chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan said they would burn effigies of Brij Bhushan throughout the country from May 11-18.

Surendra Singh Solanki, chief of Palam Khap 360, a leading khap of Delhi, said, “If the WFI chief is not arrested, we have scheduled a meeting for May 21 at Meham in Rohtak (Haryana) to devise our next strategy.” Om Prakash Dhankar, coordinator of Sarv Khap Panchayat, said they would carry out a campaign from May 11-16 in Haryana to muster public support for the agitation.

Brij Bhushan, BJP MP from Kaiserganj (UP), urged farmer leaders not to make the “mistake” and instead wait for the outcome of the probe into the allegations against him. In a video, he claimed he was innocent and alleged he was targeted as he had brought reforms in the selection process for wrestlers.

As hundreds of turbaned farmers were seen at the protest site, the scenes were similar to the farm stir that continued for 13 months until the Centre repealed the three farm laws. Anticipating a large gathering, security arrangements were beefed up in advance at Jantar Mantar.

Barricades breached

Jhajjar: Stopped at the Tikri border, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) activists breached barricades. However, a police official said 10 buses and four cars, carrying over 500 persons, were allowed to go.

Even the most powerful people of the land are oppressed by the yoke of compulsion. This compulsion, however, is not particularly oppressive or repugnant to them because it’s the compulsion of power — in a democracy, where votes and numbers are of the utmost importance, notions of justice and fairplay are expendable.

These are the lessons from the reactions of BJP leaders over serious allegations of sexual harassment made by female wrestlers against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the BJP Member of Parliament from Gonda in Uttar Pradesh, and the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president.

Singh seems to be just the sort of ‘electable’ candidates who are courted by political parties despite their shady past. In the 1990s, Singh spent months in jail after being arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly helping associates of gangster Dawood Ibrahim. He has several criminal cases pending against him, including attempt to murder; on camera, he has confessed to killing a person; in 2004, Ghanshyam Shukla died in a road accident after replacing Singh as the BJP’s candidate from Gonda, and then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called Singh and said: “Marva diya (you had him killed).” The same year, his son shot himself with Singh’s licensed gun, addressing Singh thus: ‘You have not proved to be a good father… You have never cared about my sister or me… You thought only of yourself… We see our future as dark.’

Such a man — carrying a baggage of crime, extreme emotions, trauma and entitlement — exudes bad karma and proves to be a political time-bomb. Logically, he should be an anathema to all political parties — for, his past, his actions, the allegations against him would be in conflict with the avowed principles of any political outfit.

Yet, Singh thrives. Delhi Police filed a sexual harassment case against him on the complaint of female wrestlers only after being asked to do so by the Supreme Court. One of the complainants is underage, as a Delhi Police statement noted: ‘The first FIR has been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, along with relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It was filed based on the allegations of a minor.’ It’s a non-bailable offence and legal experts say that arresting an accused in such cases is the norm, even though arrest is not mandatory.

Singh hasn’t been arrested for some reason — could it be that he’s a powerful politician from the ruling party at the Centre and wields significant power through his businesses and vote-bank in Gonda? That would be a reasonable conclusion.

Top Indian wrestler Bajrang Punia has thrown his lot with the protesters, at a significant risk to his career. What is the force that drives him, apart from the wish for justice to prevail and the ‘betiyan’ of India to be safe? Well, he’s married to Sangeeta Phogat, herself a wrestler and cousin to Vinesh Phogat, a prominent face of the wrestlers’ protest. Bajrang says he knows what female wrestlers have gone through. Bajrang and the other wrestlers, astutely, had foretold the likely response from Singh’s supporters and party brethren. After Opposition leaders visited the protest site at Jantar Mantar, Union Minister Meenakshi Lekhi said: ‘When people who are caught by the ED, who are involved in the excise scam and facing heat over a ‘Sheesh Mahal’ of Rs 45 crore reach there, the credibility of the dharna gets dented... with these discredited people joining in, what more can be said.’

She said the government has a ‘very sensitive approach towards the wrestlers, and women’. The party’s support for Singh, a POCSO accused, belies this claim.

Politicians in sport

Some well-meaning but naïve commentators have suggested that the political leadership across the spectrum must bar politicians from administrative positions in sports associations. Just which political party is free of politicians who are or have been sports administrators?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave up his position as the Gujarat Cricket Association president only after being elected as the PM. He was replaced by Amit Shah. The current GCA president is Dhanraj Parimal Nathwani, son of Rajya Sabha MP Parimal Nathwani, a YSR Congress member and a director at Reliance Industries. Amit Shah’s son Jay is the secretary of the Indian cricket board. Sports Minister Anurag Thakur headed the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association without a break from 2000 before being replaced by his brother, Arun Dhumal, in 2019. Thakur had served as president of the Indian cricket board as well. Congress’s Madhavrao Scindia served as the BCCI president in the 1990s; his son Jyotiraditya headed the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) — and his son Mahanaryaman is a vice-president of the Gwalior cricket organisation and a member of MPCA. The Congress has Rajeev Shukla, the NCP has Sharad Pawar, the National Conference has Farooq Abdullah — the chain of political parties of all hues, politicians and their relatives, cousins or underlings, in the BCCI or other sports associations is long.

This is how things work in the real world — power is inherited and bequeathed. The rajas of yore would hate the very idea of democracy because it, theoretically at least, makes all persons numerically equal. The rajas of today, created by the votes of the dispossessed millions, know that to keep power, fuzzy notions such as justice or principles must be, sometimes, sacrificed. This is political expedience, and it’s this that is saving WFI’s ‘bahubali’ Singh from arrest.

Such a man — carrying a baggage of crime, extreme emotions, trauma and entitlement — exudes bad karma and proves to be a political time-bomb. Logically, he should be an anathema to all political parties — for, his past, his actions, the allegations against him would be in conflict with the avowed principles of any political outfit.

Yet, Singh thrives. Delhi Police filed a sexual harassment case against him on the complaint of female wrestlers only after being asked to do so by the Supreme Court. One of the complainants is underage, as a Delhi Police statement noted: ‘The first FIR has been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, along with relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It was filed based on the allegations of a minor.’ It’s a non-bailable offence and legal experts say that arresting an accused in such cases is the norm, even though arrest is not mandatory.

Singh hasn’t been arrested for some reason — could it be that he’s a powerful politician from the ruling party at the Centre and wields significant power through his businesses and vote-bank in Gonda? That would be a reasonable conclusion.

Top Indian wrestler Bajrang Punia has thrown his lot with the protesters, at a significant risk to his career. What is the force that drives him, apart from the wish for justice to prevail and the ‘betiyan’ of India to be safe? Well, he’s married to Sangeeta Phogat, herself a wrestler and cousin to Vinesh Phogat, a prominent face of the wrestlers’ protest. Bajrang says he knows what female wrestlers have gone through. Bajrang and the other wrestlers, astutely, had foretold the likely response from Singh’s supporters and party brethren. After Opposition leaders visited the protest site at Jantar Mantar, Union Minister Meenakshi Lekhi said: ‘When people who are caught by the ED, who are involved in the excise scam and facing heat over a ‘Sheesh Mahal’ of Rs 45 crore reach there, the credibility of the dharna gets dented... with these discredited people joining in, what more can be said.’

She said the government has a ‘very sensitive approach towards the wrestlers, and women’. The party’s support for Singh, a POCSO accused, belies this claim.

Politicians in sport

Some well-meaning but naïve commentators have suggested that the political leadership across the spectrum must bar politicians from administrative positions in sports associations. Just which political party is free of politicians who are or have been sports administrators?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave up his position as the Gujarat Cricket Association president only after being elected as the PM. He was replaced by Amit Shah. The current GCA president is Dhanraj Parimal Nathwani, son of Rajya Sabha MP Parimal Nathwani, a YSR Congress member and a director at Reliance Industries. Amit Shah’s son Jay is the secretary of the Indian cricket board. Sports Minister Anurag Thakur headed the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association without a break from 2000 before being replaced by his brother, Arun Dhumal, in 2019. Thakur had served as president of the Indian cricket board as well. Congress’s Madhavrao Scindia served as the BCCI president in the 1990s; his son Jyotiraditya headed the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) — and his son Mahanaryaman is a vice-president of the Gwalior cricket organisation and a member of MPCA. The Congress has Rajeev Shukla, the NCP has Sharad Pawar, the National Conference has Farooq Abdullah — the chain of political parties of all hues, politicians and their relatives, cousins or underlings, in the BCCI or other sports associations is long.

This is how things work in the real world — power is inherited and bequeathed. The rajas of yore would hate the very idea of democracy because it, theoretically at least, makes all persons numerically equal. The rajas of today, created by the votes of the dispossessed millions, know that to keep power, fuzzy notions such as justice or principles must be, sometimes, sacrificed. This is political expedience, and it’s this that is saving WFI’s ‘bahubali’ Singh from arrest.

New Delhi, May 9 (Abhinav Gupta / Pratyush Ranjan PTI Fact Check): Wrestler Sakshi Malik shared on Twitter a video of huge crowd, which it claimed had gathered in support of the wrestlers protesting against Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. In its investigation, the PTI Fact Check Desk found that the video at least a year old. The old and unrelated video was shared on social media with a false claim.

The video was shared amid the ongoing protest by wrestlers against WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexual harassment. The protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar has recently received support from some groups of farmers and political parties.

Claim

Wrestler Sakshi Malik shared on May 9 a video on Twitter which showed a huge crowd, which she claimed had gathered in support of the wrestlers protesting against WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Investigation

Starting the investigation, the Desk conducted an InVid Tool Search on the video and found a few keyframes. A Google Reverse Image Search on one of the keyframes led to a Twitter post, shared on September 30, 2022.

“जयपुर में ओबीसी वर्ग का रैला... #OBC (OBC class rally in Jaipur...),” read the caption of the post.

Here is the link and archive link to the tweet and below is a screenshot of the same:

However, the Desk noticed that several users had commented on the video post, questioning the presence of BJP flags in the OBC rally.

Here is the screenshot of one such comment:

In the next part of investigation, the Desk conducted a customised Google search with the keyword “Jaipur OBC rally September 2022” and found that such a rally was indeed taken out in the city on the same day when the Twitter user posted the video.

Here is the link to a News18 Hindi’s video report on the OBC rally held in Jaipur on Sep 30 last year and below is a screenshot of the same:

While an OBC rally did take place in Jaipur, we could not establish if the visuals shown in the viral video were from that particular rally.

The Desk then conducted Google Reverse Image Search on several other keyframes of the video, but could not trace the exact origin of the video.

However, the latest origin of the video on social media, traced back to September 2022, proved that it was shared as recent with a false claim on social media.

Claim

A huge crowd gathered in support of the wrestlers protesting against WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Khargone/Bhopal (PTI): Fifteen people were killed and 20 to 25 others injured after a bus fell from a bridge on a dry river bed in Madhya Pradesh's Khargone district on Tuesday morning, state Home Minister Narottam Mishra said.

A magisterial probe has been ordered into the incident which took place at 8.40 am, he said.

The bus broke railings of Dasanga bridge and fell on a dry bed of the Borad river near Dongargaon village, Mishra told reporters.

The bus was carrying around 50 passengers when it met with the accident, a police official said.

""Fifteen people were killed and nearly 20-25 others were injured in the accident,"" Mishra said.

The injured persons were admitted to the district hospital in Khargone, he said.

A magisterial probe has been ordered into the incident, Mishra said.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced an ex-gratia of Rs four lakh to the kin of each of those killed in the accident.

The seriously injured persons will be given Rs 50,000 and those who received minor injuries will be given Rs 25,000, Mishra said.

The state government will bear entire expenses of the treatment, he added.

After the bus fell from the bridge, some villagers rushed to the spot. They pulled out people trapped inside the bus from the windows and backside of the vehicle, as per eyewitnesses.

Locals were also seen carrying people and offering water to the harried passengers amid the hot weather, they said.

Khargone Collector Shivraj Singh Verma, Superintendent of Police Dharamvir Singh and local MLA Ravi Joshi were among those who reached the spot soon after getting information about the accident.

Former Union minister Arun Yadav, who belongs to Khargone, also expressed grief over the incident.

The government’s committee headed by boxer M C Mary Kom that looked into the allegations of the wrestlers who have been protesting at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the BJP MP who runs wrestling in India, has flagged the absence of the ICC at the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) as a “major finding”.

Spontaneous Order

What Is The Law Against Sexual Harassment Of Women At The Workplace?

The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, commonly known as the PoSH Act, was passed in 2013. It defined sexual harassment, lay down the procedures for complaint and inquiry, and the action to be taken in cases of sexual harassment.

How Did The PoSH Act Come About?

The 2013 law broadened and gave legislative backing to what are known as the Vishaka Guidelines, which were laid down by the Supreme Court in a judgment passed in 1997.

The case in question was filed by women’s rights groups, including one called Vishaka, over the alleged gangrape of a social worker from Rajasthan named Bhanwari Devi. Bhanwari had fought against the marriage of a one-year-old baby girl in 1992, and had been allegedly gangraped as retribution.

The Vishaka Guidelines defined sexual harassment and imposed three key obligations on institutions — prohibition, prevention, redress. The Supreme Court directed that they should establish a Complaints Committee, which would look into matters of sexual harassment of women at the workplace. The court made the guidelines legally binding.

What Does The Act Say About The Complaints Committee?

The PoSH Act subsequently mandated that every employer must constitute an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at each office or branch that had 10 or more employees. It defined various aspects of sexual harassment, and lay down procedures for action in case of a complaint.

The aggrieved victim under the Act can be a woman “of any age whether employed [at the workplace] or not”, who “alleges to have been subjected to any act of sexual harassment”. In effect, the Act protects the rights of all women who are working or visiting any workplace, in any capacity.

What Constitutes Sexual Harassment Under The PoSH Act?

Under the 2013 law, sexual harassment includes “any one or more” of the following “unwelcome acts or behaviour” committed directly or by implication:

Physical contact and advances

A demand or request for sexual favours

Sexually coloured remarks

Showing pornography

Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature.

A ‘Handbook on Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace’ published by the Ministry of Women & Child Development contains more detailed instances of behaviour that constitutes sexual harassment at the workplace. These circumstances include, broadly:



Sexually suggestive remarks or innuendo; serious or repeated offensive remarks; inappropriate questions or remarks about a person’s sex life;

Display of sexist or offensive pictures, posters, MMS, SMS, WhatsApp, or emails; Intimidation, threats, blackmail around sexual favours;

Threats, intimidation or retaliation against an employee who speaks up about these;

Unwelcome social invitations with sexual overtones, commonly seen as flirting; and

Unwelcome sexual advances.

The Handbook says “unwelcome behaviour” is experienced when the victim feels bad or powerless, and when it causes anger/ sadness or negative self-esteem. Unwelcome behaviour is “illegal, demeaning, invading, one-sided and power-based”.

In addition, the PoSH Act mentions five circumstances that amount to sexual harassment:

Implied or explicit promise of preferential treatment in her employment;

Implied or explicit threat of detrimental treatment;

Implied or explicit threat about the complainant’s present or future employment status;

Interference with the complainant’s work or creating an offensive or hostile work environment;

Humiliating treatment of the complainant that is likely to affect her health or safety.

What Is The Procedure For Complaint Under The Act?

It is not compulsory for the aggrieved victim to file a complaint for the ICC to take action. The Act says that she “may” do so — and if she cannot, any member of the ICC “shall” render “all reasonable assistance” to her to complain in writing.

If the woman cannot complain because of “physical or mental incapacity or death or otherwise”, her legal heir may do so.

Under the Act, the complaint must be made “within three months from the date of the incident”. However, the ICC can “extend the time limit” if “it is satisfied that the circumstances were such which prevented the woman from filing a complaint within the said period”.



The ICC “may”, before inquiry, and “at the request of the aggrieved woman, take steps to settle the matter between her and the respondent through conciliation” — provided that “no monetary settlement shall be made as a basis of conciliation”.

The ICC may either forward the victim’s complaint to the police, or it can start an inquiry that has to be completed within 90 days. The ICC has powers similar to those of a civil court in respect of summoning and examining any person on oath, and requiring the discovery and production of documents.

When the inquiry is completed, the ICC must provide a report of its findings to the employer within 10 days. The report must also be made available to both parties.

The identity of the woman, respondent, witness, any information on the inquiry, recommendation and action taken, should not be made public.

What Happens After The ICC Has Filed Its Report?

If the allegations of sexual harassment are proved, the ICC will recommend to the employer to take action “in accordance with the provisions of the service rules” of the company. These may vary from company to company.

The ICC may also recommend that the company deduct the salary of the person found guilty, “as it may consider appropriate”. The compensation is determined based on five aspects: suffering and emotional distress caused to the woman; loss in career opportunity; her medical expenses; income and financial status of the respondent; and the feasibility of such payment.

If either the aggrieved woman or the respondent is not satisfied, they may appeal in court within 90 days.

What Protection Is Available In The Act Against A False Complaint Of Sexual Harassment?

Section 14 of the Act deals with punishment for false or malicious complaint and false evidence.

In such a case, the ICC “may recommend” to the employer that it take action against the woman, or the person who has made the complaint, in “accordance with the provisions of the service rules”.

The Act, however, makes it clear that action cannot be taken for “mere inability” to “substantiate the complaint or provide adequate proof”.

Jhajjar, May 7

The Delhi and Haryana Police made tight security arrangements on the Tikri-Bahadurgarh border and other places leading to Delhi on Sunday in view of the call given by the khap panchayats to reach Jantar Mantar where wrestlers have been staging an indefinite dharna against the WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh for the past two weeks.

A large number of Delhi police personnel were deployed at Tikri and every vehicle passing through the border was being checked. Multi-layer barricading was also put up to keep a close tab on the movement of the vehicles.

Activists of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), including women, organised a protest demonstration at the Tikri border after being stopped by the Delhi police from entering the Capital. The protesters raised slogans against the Central government and broke the barricading done by the Delhi cops who let the commuters go after checking their vehicles.

“We announced to reach Delhi on May 7 to support the wrestlers’ protest, but the Delhi police stopped us by putting up barricades on the Tikri border. We entered Delhi after breaking the barricades,” said one of the women protesters.

BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan, while talking to mediapersons on the occasion, said they had come here to support the protesting wrestlers and would return to Punjab in the evening if the government did not stop them. He demanded that the Centre should take action against the WFI chief facing charges of sexual harassment.

Bahadurgarh DSP Pawan Sharma said the barricading was done and additional force was deployed at the border to prevent any untoward incident as a considerable number of people from Punjab and different parts of Haryana used this route to reach Jantar Mantar in Delhi. “The security arrangements will continue till further orders,” he added.

Meanwhile, a higher official of the Delhi police claimed that no one was stopped from entering Delhi today. “A total of 10 buses and four cars, carrying over 500 persons, were allowed from the Tikri border in the morning after checking their vehicles,” he added.

However, the grappler deleted the story after a section of users on Instagram began criticising him for his post.

This comes amid a protest by the Bajrang Dal against Congress's manifesto that vows a ban on the outfit once the party is voted to power in the impending Karnataka Assembly polls.

Several top wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, have staged a protest demanding action against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment.

Meanwhile, farmers joined top wrestlers in protest against Brij Bhushan Singh and gave an ultimatum to the Union government on Sunday.

The Khap panchayat leaders along with protesting wrestlers gave a 15-day deadline to the government to take action against Brij Bhushan Singh, also a BJP MP. They have demanded the arrest of the federation chief, who faces two FIRs including one under the Pocso Act.

WRESTLERS VS WFI

Top wrestlers first came out in protest against the WFI chief in January, accusing him of sexual exploitation. They had demanded that WFI be disbanded and its president be removed. The sports ministry then formed an oversight committee headed by boxing great MC Mary Kom on January 23 and asked it to submit its findings in one month. The government is yet to make the findings public.

On May 3, a scuffle broke out between the wrestlers and some police personnel, leading to head injuries to a couple of protesters. The wrestlers alleged they were manhandled by the police personnel, but Delhi Police denied they used force against the grapplers.

Elaborate security arrangements have been made at Jantar Mantar. Security forces have been deployed and activities at the protest site are being monitored round the clock through CCTVs to ensure that no untoward incident takes place.

In the past year, Singh has questioned some UP government’s actions and the state administration has turned uncooperative towards some of his supporters. Singh’s extraordinary clout stems from his direct links with the party high command in Delhi which has used his services in the past to liaise with politicians from other parties who share a common interest in wrestling. This includes SP’s Akhilesh Yadav.

In the 2022 Goa Assembly elections, unsure whether the BJP would score an outright victory, Shah had requested Singh to fly to Goa to use his influence with three potential winning candidates who were not in the BJP but, being a part of the wrestling circuit, were friendly with him.

A Pawar-ful Coup

The Pawar family’s body language during Sharad Pawar’s dramatic resignation announcement this week told the whole story. The patriarch looked completely in control, with his wife Pratibha, who plays an important role behind the scenes, by his side. Nephew Ajit Pawar, who had assumed that he would be his uncle’s successor, appeared rattled and sought to silence workers who were demanding Pawar not resign.

Daughter Supriya looked smug as she gesticulated to senior leader Jayant Patil to join her and Ajit in the front row. By Friday Pawar had agreed to take back his resignation after the outcry in the party. Even if he had not stepped down, Pawar would have ensured that he remained the effective boss by dividing the leadership role among Supriya, Ajit and Jayant.

Pawar’s resignation should be seen in the context of recent developments. Home Minister Amit Shah visited Mumbai thrice last month and gave a dressing down to the Eknath Shinde-led Sena members. Surveys indicate that though Shinde has the majority of legislators, Uddhav Thackeray still retains the loyalty of party workers. Shah told the Shinde Sena MLAs to tour their constituencies and not sit in Mumbai. The smarting Shinde faction retaliated by threatening the BJP that if Ajit joined the alliance, as speculated in the media, it would pull out. Pawar — aware that Ajit, as well as close lieutenants Praful Patel and Sunil Tatkare are pushing for a tie-up with the BJP to prevent the ED and the CBI from registering cases against them — pulled a rabbit out of his hat.

Untimely event

Indian embassies were directed to ensure that PM Narendra Modi’s 100th episode of Mann ki Baat should be relayed live in their respective regions with a large audience and that VIPs should be persuaded to attend. But the mandarins in South Block did not take into account the problems of streaming live in different time zones.

For instance, at India House in London, the function was at 6.30 am. Singer Raageshwari, when interviewed, gushed, “Waking up at 4 in the morning, getting ready and coming here absolutely fruitful.” Some suspected a tinge of sarcasm in her remark. The Permanent Mission in New York held the event at the UN Trusteeship Council with much fanfare. Mission employees were ordered to fill empty chairs at the function, which was conducted past midnight. In Africa’s Eswatini, an official photograph showed a family of three, including an infant in arms, listening to the show.

Ungracious Politics

The grand old man of Punjab, Parkash Singh Badal, was cremated at Lambi village in Muktsar district with full state honours. BJP president J P Nadda and senior leaders from many parties paid homage. Badal’s son Sukhbir Singh Badal, who lit the pyre, commented bitterly to a relative that politics was a cruel business. Many of those who had much to thank the Akali Dal for were missing. Just a few thousand attended the funeral. Sukhbir observed that if the Akali Dal had been in power, lakhs would have shown up.

Video wars

The bitter campaign war in Karnataka often hits below the belt. For instance, the BJP was busy tweeting two videos of Congress leader D K Shivkumar’s door-to-door campaign, giving them a mischievous interpretation. In one, Shivkumar is seen distributing Rs 500 notes to the crowd. He has explained that he was, in fact, offering donations to a religious procession moving alongside his truck. In the other video, Shivkumar is seen lurching, unable to hold himself erect during a padayatra, as his followers try to block the camera person. Shivkumar explained that he was certainly not tipsy, but suffering from low blood pressure. A party leader suggested tartly that he should eat ice cream at the end of the day to combat low blood-sugar levels.","A Pawar-ful CoupThe Pawar family’s body language during Sharad Pawar’s dramatic resignation announcement this week told the whole story.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/rights/wrestlers-protest-brij-bhushan-singh-mary-kom-oversight-committee,,None,Wrestlers' Protest | Govt-Appointed Panel Was Biased Towards BJP MP Singh: Complainants,"New Delhi: As wrestlers protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar for attention to serious allegations of sexual harassment against Wrestling Federation of India chief and BJP MP, Brij Bhushan Singh, complainants have said that the oversight committee appointed by the Union government is biased towards the accused, Economic Times reports.

The complainants in this case are seven wrestlers, including a minor athlete. The Delhi Police has filed an FIR against Singh only after the Supreme Court heard the wrestlers’ petition urging for an FIR to be registered.

The apex court asked that the identities of the complainants be kept under wraps considering the threat to their safety.

The Economic Times, which has claimed to have seen the FIR against Singh, noted in the report that the almost all the complainants, including the minor, believe that video recordings of the testimonies made before the committee may have been tampered with to protect the BJP MP.

This oversight committee had been set up in January, after the first round of protests by the wrestlers, against Singh.

Headed by boxing legend M.C. Mary Kom, the committee also has Olympic medallist Yogeshwar Dutt, Dhyanchand awardee Trupti Murgunde, SAI member Radhica Sreeman and ex-CEO, TOPS, retired Captain Rajesh Rajagopalan.

The committee was mandated to enquire into the allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment and/or intimidation, financial irregularities and administrative lapses, levelled by the prominent sportspersons and to complete the enquiry in four weeks.

The panel submitted its report last month to the Union government. It has since not been made public.

The wrestlers who had been part of the protests then and now – Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia and others – had said that they were not consulted when the government formed the oversight committee to look into their claims.

The ET report now mentions that in their FIR, almost all complainants repeated their lack of confidence in this committee. “They expressed ‘utter shock’ in their complaints that panel members tried to ‘justify the actions of the accused,’ Singh’s alleged acts were projected as nothing but ‘an act of innocence done in good faith’ by committee members and they implied that the complainant may have ‘interpreted’ the same ‘in a wrongful manner,’ one of the FIRs is learnt to read,” the report notes.

The report also says that the committee appeared to have already decided to favour Singh or act on his instructions and eventually gave him a clean chit.

Note: An earlier version of this article misidentified Trupti Murugunde in a photo.","The complainants in this case are seven wrestlers, including a minor athlete.

“The protestors at Jantar Mantar are being facilitated. Entry is being regulated through DFMD [door frame metal detector] to ensure safety. Please remain peaceful and abide by the law,” it said.

Among farmers’ groups which have joined are two of the biggest in north India, the Bhartiya Kisan Union and the Samyukta Kisan Morcha.

On the night of last Wednesday, the wrestlers had alleged that they were manhandled and abused by drunk policemen from the Delhi Police. The incident reportedly occurred when the wrestlers attempted to bring plank beds to the protest site.

Meanwhile, Indian Express has reported that while a two-person delegation, including the director general of the Sports Authority of India Sandip Pradhan, met with members of the nine-person advisory committee made by the protesting wrestlers late on Saturday night, there has been silence from SAI since then.

The wrestlers, including Olympic medal winners Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, and world champion Vinesh Phogat, have been seeking the arrest of MP Singh, who they have claimed has a leading role in the systematic exploitation and sexual harassment of women athletes. One of his victims is a minor, the wrestlers have said.","While some reports had it that the farmers had broken through barricades to join the protesters, the Delhi police tweeted that no altercations had taken place between farmers and law enforcers and that farmers who were in a “hurry to reach the site” had knocked down barricades.

“All the women can connect to this battle of ours. The supporters have given us strength. We are ready to fight,” she continued.

Seven female wrestlers – including one minor – have filed police complaints against Singh for sexually harassing them. The police filed two FIRs against him on April 28.

“We have discussed with our lawyers. Our statements have not been recorded under (Section) 164 (of the Criminal Code of Procedure) and we are waiting for this. And the police have been given a deadline to ensure that the statements are recorded within this deadline. My request is to record our statements as soon as possible because only then can the case move forward,” Malik said while speaking to reporters on Saturday (May 6).

According to The Indian Express, a police official said that the complainants’ statements have been recorded under Section CrPC Section 161 – while the wrestlers say it should be recorded under Section 164.

Earlier, the wrestlers had alleged that the police was acting slowly because the government is protecting Singh, even accusing Union sports minister Anurag Thakur of engaging in a “hush job”. The wrestlers had met Thakur in January and called off their protest a day later based on his assurances, but the promises he made of a fair probe were not kept. The wrestlers resumed their protest on April 23.

Two FIRs were filed against Singh on April 28, which the wrestlers believe was only due to the Supreme Court’s intervention. However, even after that, they have accused the authorities of not carrying out the necessary steps in a timely manner.

On Sunday (May 7), a khap panchayat has been organised at the Jantar Mantar protest site, with several farmers’ leaders joining in. “The protest will continue till these kids (protesting wrestlers) get justice but how we take it forward, that will be decided by all of us today,” said Chaudhary Surender Solanki, khap president Palam.","Our statements have not been recorded under (Section) 164 (of the Criminal Code of Procedure) and we are waiting for this.

We will follow their directions, if the investigations don’t take place quickly and correctly, we have options open to us, as they said, of going to the Delhi high court or magistrate court,” Vinesh Phogat said on Thursday evening, according to The Indian Express.

“We respect the Supreme Court order, protest will continue,” Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik said, according to NDTV. “Supreme Court order is not a setback, it did what it could in this matter.”

The court’s order came hours after the wrestlers alleged they had been manhandled and abused at the Jantar Mantar protest site by the Delhi Police. “What’s the point of winning medals for the country when we are treated this way? Take back the medals,” Bajrang Punia said at a press conference on Thursday morning, according to The Indian Express. ” Take back the government awards. When the police are behaving this way – abusing, roughing us up, and pushing us around – then they don’t remember the awards we’ve been given, the medals we have won?”

A journalist, Sakshi Joshi, was also reportedly pushed around by the police when she went to cover Wednesday night’s happenings at Jantar Mantar. Several media bodies, including the Press Club of India and Reporters Without Borders, have called for strict action against the policemen who stopped a journalist from doing her job.

Meanwhile, several farmers’ organisations have expressed solidarity with the protesting wrestlers and criticised the police action. Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal and general secretary Gurmeet Singh Mahma said the BJP’s anti-women face was showing, The Times of India reported. Several farmers’ organisations have said they will collect at Jantar Mantar on Sunday (May 7) in support of the wrestlers.","“We are very grateful for what the Supreme Court has done for us.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/law/supreme-court-closes-plea-wrestlers-brij-bhushan-singh,,None,Supreme Court Closes Proceedings in Plea by Wrestlers Against Brij Bhushan Singh,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday, May 4, closed the proceedings in the petition filed by female wrestlers who wanted their allegations of sexual harassment against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to be investigated.

According to Bar and Bench, the bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices P.S. Narasimha and J.B. Pardiwala said that the plea for the registration of a first information report (FIR) has been satisfied.

“The purpose of the plea was registration of FIR which is now registered. Apart from registration of FIR this court had passed some other directions to ensure security to complainants. Police has indicated that proper security has been provided to minor complainants and due security has been provided to others. Having regard to the ambit of the case before us, we close the proceedings now,” the bench said, according to the report.

The petitioner’s counsel, senior advocate Narendar Hooda, asked the court not to close the proceedings because the Delhi police may “drag its feet” if that is done. He said that the police probe should be monitored by a judge or a magistrate. However, the top court said the petitioners may move “the appropriate jurisdictional magisterial court or the high court”.

“We have confined ourselves to the prayer and that is served and if you are aggrieved by magistrate court order you can approach Delhi high court,” CJI Chandrachud said, according to Bar and Bench.

The SC’s decision comes mere hours after the wrestlers alleged that a “drunk policeman” manhandled them and abused them at the protest site in Jantar Mantar on Wednesday night.

Meanwhile, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Delhi Police, said that the “investigation is on track and statements are being recorded”. The probe is being led by “a senior lady officer and her team”, he said, adding, “There is something more than what meets the eye.”

The petitioners’ counsel also referred to reports about the scuffle between the Delhi police and the wrestlers, to which SG Mehta said that “two political leaders of a particular party went there with beds, which the police sought to stop and this led to a scuffle”, according to LiveLaw. He denied that the policemen were drunk, saying medical tests showed otherwise.","According to Bar and Bench, the bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/politics/bajrang-punia-bajrang-dal-narendra-modi-wrestlers,,None,"For Bajrang Dal, a PM's Chant. For Bajrang Punia, a Midnight Police Assault","Bengaluru: The Delhi police’s midnight manhandling of protesting wrestlers at Jantar Mantar is the latest instance of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government’s inclination to crush any form of dissent.

Not many would have thought that even internationally-reputed Indian wrestlers and Olympic medalists like Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia will be treated with the same apathy as most other groups who have had reason to protest in the recent past.

The wrestlers have been demanding punishment for alleged sexual offenders in the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). They claim that the WFI president and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Singh and some coaches have sexually harassed multiple female athletes. For similar accusations against M.J. Akbar, the Union government had swiftly removed the former Union minister. But it has been largely muted in its response to the wrestlers’ protest.

Singh is an extremely powerful and resourceful MP from Uttar Pradesh, and has never hidden his strongman image. He is rumoured to have a direct or indirect role in several crimes, including murders. Even while dismissing such accusations, Singh himself admitted to have committed “only one murder.” He is said to have great influence in over a dozen assembly seats in UP’s Gonda, which is why the BJP is reluctant in letting him go.

The assault on wrestlers on the night of May 3, 2023 is a culmination of many moves already made by the government and its BJP supporters to malign and invalidate the serious charges that the wrestlers have been making against the governing members of the WFI. First, the Union sports minister Anurag Singh Thakur claimed that he had already met the protesting wrestlers for over 12 hours and heard their accusations. However, the wrestlers denied having ever met Thakur, alleging that many requests made to the ministers went unheard.

Singh, on the other hand, accused the wrestlers of conspiring against him at the behest of “a politician and an industrialist”.

At the same time, the BJP and compliant media have only complemented each other in efforts to protect Singh by equating the wrestlers’s protests over sexual harassment allegations with those who it could easily berate as the “tukde tukde gang” or “anti-India”.

Now, following the assault on wrestlers by alleged non-uniformed “drunk” policemen, the government has transformed the site of their protest into a fortress guarded by more policemen. The heavy barricading of the protest site reeks of the criminal treatment that the government has meted out to the Indian wrestlers.

🚨Heavy barricading at Jantar Mantar after last night’s standoff between Delhi and Police and protesting wrestlers. Media is also not being allowed inside. @TheQuint #WrestlerProtest pic.twitter.com/K6dAvqTNxK — Himanshi Dahiya (@himansshhi) May 4, 2023

The chain of events around the wrestlers’s agitation only highlights the fact that the Union government may have set a template to deal with all forms of dissent. The justness of the cause simply does not matter to the powers that be, who have shown their incapability to understand any concern outside their own electoral interests.

The year-long farmers’s movement on the borders of Delhi was treated in a similar way.

Firstly, the government and their supporters berated the protesting farmers as stooges of “Khalistani separatists”. The BJP supporters dismissed the agitation as sponsored by rich farmers and criminals when clearly all sections of the farming community were participating in it. The tags of “tukde tukde gang” and “anti-national” were slapped on them from the first day the farmers began agitating. The government officials and ministers engaged with them in multiple rounds of talks but only to hammer down the point that the farming laws could not be revoked. Even when the government was forced to revoke the laws, it has reneged on its promise of legalising the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) system.

Like last night when the wrestlers were faced with police attacking them late in the night, the protesting farmers saw multiple assaults on them at the protest sites late in the night. The barricading of the Jantar Mantar amidst heavy police deployment reminds one of the Delhi police’s attempt to stop the marching farmers by erecting nails and barbed wires on roads and constructing cement walls.

The course of events during the anti-CAA protests were similar.

Castigating the peaceful Muslim protestors down by equating them with “terrorists”, booking many supporters of the movement in conspiracy and UAPA charges, lathi-charging university students and other protestors across the country, creating riot-like conditions through fringe rightwing organisations, ministers deriding the protests that swore on constitutional nationalism with hateful Islamophobhic statements – all happened before the protest sites were uprooted by forces in a joint action by Delhi police and Hindutva organisations.

The more things change, the more they stay the same. The BJP-led government has only proven the old adage to be true in all its aspects.

While the protesting wrestler and Olympic medalist Bajrang Punia, who is agitating in support of his female colleagues, is being reprimanded with the use of sheer force, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP has been defending the violent Bajrang Dal in Karnataka’s electoral ground. The Congress’s decision to equate Bajrang Dal and the Popular Front of India while promising to ban fundamentalist organisations has been projected by the saffron forces as an affront to Hindu faith.

Most Karnataka residents are familiar with Bajrang Dal’s tendency to stir up religious controversies where there are none. Most of them also know about the organisation’s proclivity for violence while whipping up hate campaigns against Muslims. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the Prime Minister as he has not only defended Bajrang Dal but has also asked voters to chant “Jai Bajrang Bali” before voting. In all his rallies over the last two days, he has attacked the Congress for allegedly denigrating Lord Hanuman by promising to ban Bajrang Dal.

Modi doesn’t mind stirring up polarising sentiments if they entail political benefits to his party. In Karnataka, his last-mile push has been that of hardline Hindutva, alienating Muslims further from the mainstream, and using Bajrang Dal as a prop to consolidate Hindus along religious lines.

Should the PFI now say that the central ban on the organisation was an attack on Islam? BJP’s logic was tersely summed by senior journalist Neena Vyas. “Does the PM know Ram naam is not the same as Ram Sena, Bajrangbali not equal to Bajrang Dal? The latter, the Dal, has repeatedly shown itself to be above law…When BJP split the Shiv Sena was it insulting Lord Shiva?” she tweeted.

The government’s response to both Bajrang Dal and Bajrang Punia has been a tale of opposites. One Bajrang has shamed the government for inaction against an alleged sexual offender, and was, therefore, dealt with a heavy hand, with a complete lack of humanism. The other Bajrang that has frequently seen itself as above law is empowered and encouraged to act with further impunity by none other than the Prime Minister.

The hollowness of BJP’s slogan “sabka saath, sabka vikaas” shows through the two episodes. They also prove that the government has different yardsticks for different people. As long as violent organisations like Bajrang Dal advance BJP’s political and ideological interests, they can be accorded a position above law and a place above criticism. But those asking for justice will be nipped in the bud. It doesn’t matter that those seeking justice could be Olympic medalists who brought glory to the nation.","But that perhaps doesn’t bother the Prime Minister as he has not only defended Bajrang Dal but has also asked voters to chant “Jai Bajrang Bali” before voting.

The incident reportedly occurred when the wrestlers attempted to bring plank beds to the protest site.

The decision to bring in the beds was because of the intense unseasonal rain seen in Delhi over the last few days. “You can come inside and see,” wrestler Vinesh Phogat said at a late night press conference after the tensions had subsided. “Water has filled everywhere, there’s no place to sleep.”

When they brought the planks and foldable beds, a lone drunk male policeman, “Dharmendra”, started pushing the wrestlers around, she continued, without any female policeman present.

“After all that he has done, Brij Bhushan [Sharan Singh] is happily sleeping in his bed at home. For us, even a wooden plank is seen as too much luxury,” Vinesh said, breaking down. “Is this how little respect we get? Here we’re fighting for our dignity, and you will push us around like this? If I have won so many medals to see days like this, I hope no Indian athlete has to win medals again.”

VIDEO | “The way they have made us suffer, I would not want any athlete to win a medal for the country,” says wrestler Vinesh Phogat. pic.twitter.com/EpSk6dc3ZL — Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) May 3, 2023

Olympian and Commonwealth Games Gold medallist Geeta Phogat has said that her younger brother Dushyant Phogat’s head “was cracked open” in the scuffle with the police.

जंतर-मंतर पर पुलिस द्वारा पहलवानों पर हमला जिसमें मेरे छोटे भाई दुष्यंत फौगाट का सिर फोड़ दिया गया है और एक अन्य पहलवान को भी चोट आयी है ये बहुत ही शर्मनाक है — geeta phogat (@geeta_phogat) May 3, 2023

One person at the protest site reportedly fell unconscious and had to be taken to hospital.

Wrestler Bajrang Punia too said that he would like government to take back all his medals, if this is all they were worth. Later, in a video message, Punia said he, Vinesh and Sakshi Malik (who have been at the forefront of the protest) were fine. He asked all their well-wishers to be polite with the police, who was threatening to detain anyone who was coming to the protest site. “The police have said nobody can come here at night, they will detain everyone. They are trying to move away from the issue, we won’t do that,” Punia said.

Aam Aadmi Party MLA Somnath Bharti and two others were detained. Police alleged that Bharti had brought folding beds to the protest site “without permission”, NDTV reported.

“On being asked about the beds, his supporters became aggressive and tried to get the beds from a truck. Subsequently, a minor altercation took place following which Bharti, along with two others, was detained,” the police said.

AAP minister Saurabh Bharadwaj tagged L-G V.K. Saxena in a tweet, asking him to take note of the incident. “Please note Lt Governor Delhi. A Delhi Police officer attacked a wrestler at Jantar Mantar. It is alleged that the policeman was drunk. A medical test should be conducted and MLC of the victim should also be registered,” he said.

NDTV reported that the police have now sealed the protest site at Jantar Mantar, thereby stopping the regular flow of well-wishers who were coming to meet the protesting wrestlers.

The protesting wrestlers have alleged that the Delhi Police is dragging its feet on the case as neither Singh nor the women who complained of sexual harassment have been called in for questioning.

Singh, meanwhile, recently declared that all the complainants against him – there were seven women who approached the Delhi Police – have been “paid”. The protesting wrestlers, according to him, were those who were at “Shaheen Bagh and the farmers’ protest”.

Despite the unseasonal rains in New Delhi, the wrestlers have remained at the protest site in Jantar Mantar, where they refused police security. They have also decided to foreground the allegations of sexual harassment to ensure the safety of women wrestlers, they said, even though there are several allegations of financial irregularities, verbal abuse etc. against Singh as well. The wrestlers have said they will continue their protest until they can be certain that the authorities are serious about acting against Singh.

As The Wire has reported, Singh has a long history of being on the wrong side of the law but perhaps getting by anyway because of his political clout. He has himself claimed that he has committed murder.

The Supreme Court is supposed to hear the wrestlers’ petition against Singh on Thursday.","New Delhi: Wrestlers protesting at Jantar Mantar have alleged that they manhandled and abused by drunk policemen from the Delhi Police on Wednesday night.

The march was to begin at Arts Faculty, DU and invited Indian wrestler Bajrang Punia as the chief guest. However, more than 50 Delhi Police and RAF personnel came to the protest site and imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prohibits the gathering of four or more people. The police also announced on a speaker that there should be no gathering around the site.

But, the students changed the venue of the march. The Delhi police then started detaining the students from the site, where hundreds of students were raising slogans in solidarity with women wrestlers. The students raised slogans demanding justice for the protesting wrestlers and also demanded the arrest of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

The Wire spoke to several students who were protesting.

“We were protesting to extend our support for protesting wrestlers.

“The Delhi Police have not done anything so far,” Bajrang Punia, who among the renowned wrestlers protesting at Jantar Mantar, said, according to The Tribune.

“The victims’ statements are yet to be recorded. What kind of an investigation is this? Brij Bhushan is yet to be summoned,” added Sakshi Malik.

The reason why the case is dragging and action is so slow, according to Vinesh Phogat, is because the Union sports minister Anurag Thakur had engaged in a “hush job”. The wrestlers had met Thakur in January and called off their protest a day later based on his assurances, but the promises he made of a fair probe were not kept.

“We waited for three-four months but when nothing happened, we came to Jan­tar Mantar. When we met the sports minister, the women wrestlers shared individual incidents related to sexual harassment. The girls were crying before him, but no action was taken. The sports minister tried to hush up the matter yet again by forming a committee. We have tried to raise this issue at every level but the matter was always suppressed,” said Vinesh, according to The Telegraph.

Punia, Malik and Vinesh have been at the forefront of the protests against Singh. Vinesh’s sister Babita Phogat, who is also a wrestler, had joined the BJP in 2019 – and the recent protests have emerged as a point of disagreement between the two sisters. Babita has questioned the protests, even alleging that they are a political ploy.

“If you are not standing for the rights of aggrieved female wrestlers, Babita sister, I request you with folded hands not to weaken our movement. It has taken years for female wrestlers to speak up against their abusers. You are also a woman, try to understand our pain,” Vinesh tweeted recently.

Babita is part of the government-appointed panel that was appointed to probe the allegations against Singh, led by boxer Mary Kom. However, the protestors say they have lost faith in this committee, which is not acting in the best interests of the sportspeople. P.T. Usha, head of the Indian Olympics Association, has also criticised the protests.

“We are much better than people like Mary Kom and P.T. Usha. If former athletes such as them do not support us, it’s a matter of shame. We do not want them to sit here with us. We just want them to support us,” Malik said, according to The Tribune. “I have been hearing since my childhood that politicians cannot be trusted as they turn on their families. They (Usha and Mary) have proved it. These are the people I grew up watching and aspired to become, but I have learnt my lessons the hard way.”

Punia too agreed that these sportspeople were now more worried about their positions than the safety of those playing the games. “PT Usha must realise that she got this position because of her sports achievements, but she has become a politician now,” he said.

Singh, meanwhile, recently declared that all the complainants against him – there were seven women who approached the Delhi Police – have been “paid”. The protesting wrestlers, according to him, were those who were at “Shaheen Bagh and the farmers’ protest”.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/government/the-hypocrisy-of-sabka-saath-and-beti-bachao,,None,The Hypocrisy of 'Sabka Saath' and 'Beti Bachao',"“Sabka Saath” is a lie or a delusion. More likely a lie because exclusion is deliberately perpetrated and institutionalised in the Bharatiya Janata Party.

It has no Muslim MP or MLA but says “sabka saath,” with everyone.

Its ministers garland those who are convicted of lynching the minorities, but it says “sabka saath”.

Who is it really fooling? Nobody, but it wants to say these words because it is not honest. Or perhaps it was a nice-sounding jumla at the time. Or perhaps that time was not right for the party to openly claim what it really stands for. Whatever we conclude as the reason, it is inescapable that the slogan itself is untrue because the numbers do not lie.

“Beti bachao,” or ‘save the girl’, is not a convincing phrase in the mouths of those who free convicted rapists for coldly-calculated political benefit.

“Beti bachao” is a jumla when BJP supporters, national heroines in their own field, must sit in protest to beg for action against their oppressor. The government is reluctant to act because the man in question is a long-term party MP and it senses there might be political benefit in not acting. This is the only reason it looks away from, and in that sense condones and encourages, the harassment of India’s daughters. And yet it claims to promote “beti bachao”, though in court it is unwilling to reveal the reasons for choosing to release convicted rapists. Again, mark the reluctance to reveal oneself honestly.

In how many democracies is the political rhetoric this disjointed from the reality of the nation? One cannot think of any, really.

Of course, it is true that hypocrisy and lies are a part of all political activity, and that is the reason why many people are not attracted to it. But this level of fake piety and pretend virtue while the deception is visible for all to see is likely to be unique to us, and that is why we have to talk about it.

It is quite remarkable that a political party can do this and assume it can get away with it forever, but such is the arrogance of power and this time the delusion is likely real. On the one hand there is a mass media that is feeding at the trough and happy to be seen as a cheerleader for the government, if not aching to be an actual part of the official propaganda machine. From them we can expect no honest survey or assessment. Add to this a set of the world’s most craven celebrities, film stars, musicians and cricketers. Unwilling to stand up even for their own when they are tortured and persecuted. Both are too afraid to speak and too selfish and greedy to put at stake the riches they have gathered through their fame. And so externally, there is no large dissenting, authoritative and popular voice to point out that what is being shown as day is really night.

On the other the leader is shielded by those who line up to say in public the opposite of what is manifest and apparent and what probably even they believe to be true. This works in particular with those leaders who have convinced themselves that they can only ever do the right thing. They want to be shown the evidence of this, and there is no shortage of people available to do this.

If the leader holds gigantic rallies when the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic devastates the land, the aides will prove that his rallies do not spread COVID. The BJP first passed a resolution, just before the second wave started, declaring that the Prime Minister had defeated the COVID pandemic, and then deleted the resolution from its website.

When religious bigotry is exposed as the fundamental pillar of the BJP’s politics, they will show that in the distribution of entitlements, the party does not discriminate against minorities (as if such a thing were even possible, and as if anyone had ever accused them of doing this, but let us set that aside for now).

If joblessness and low wages are being experienced by crores of people and being reported on daily, they will conjure data that show this is not the case and India is in fact not only marching into the “Amrit Kaal”, but is already in it. The government’s own data that shows poverty increasing and consumption, including on food, decreasing between 2012 and 2018, is discarded because it is inconvenient.

No reason is given and the findings are not put out in the open for scrutiny. We must accept the government’s word that the data it collected itself is so bad it cannot be revealed. The government’s own finding that joblessness has hit record levels in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, was discredited by the courtiers, till the election was over and then released without change or comment. This is the ethics and morality of those who surround the king and whisper into his ears that all is well. The same people, including women in positions of power, are complicit in what is happening around them, and choose complicity over integrity.

In such a place, perhaps it becomes too easy to believe in what one says though the evidence all points in the other direction. It is a variant of the actions being taken by those three monkeys: See no evil, speak no truth and listen to no criticism. The chant continues: “beti bachao” and “sabka saath”.

Some of the members have reportedly felt upset that the Commission has not been proactively supporting the protesting wrestlers, with one even wanting to go to Jantar Mantar before they were stopped by another member, Hindustan Times reported.

Two members of the Commission have told Hindustan Times that everything had been decided on Saturday (about issuing a statement). “We were all on the same page. We agreed that the AC has largely failed the wrestlers. There has not been a single statement acknowledging them, neither in January nor in April,” they said.

“So, it was decided we put out a public statement in support of the wrestlers. The letter was drafted but just before we were to make it public, it was blocked,” one of the members told the newspaper. The two made it clear that the members Commission who attended Saturday’s meeting had decided to issue a statement. However, not all members where present – including chairperson Mary Kom, who is also the head of the government-appointed panel to probe the allegations of sexual and verbal harassment against Singh.

“A majority of those who attended the meeting wanted the statement to go out, but since only six members were present, it was not really AC’s majority,” a member who was at the meeting told Hindustan Times.

According to The Indian Express, Winter Olympian Shiva Keshavan had drafted the statement, which used neutral wording and pushed for proper mechanisms in place for safe sport. While the draft was agreed upon during the meeting, London Games bronze medallist Gagan Narang said on their WhatsApp group later that it was “too late” to issue a statement. Narang is also the vice-president of the IOA.

The IOA’s role in the current controversy has already come under the scanner because of the statement made by the body’s president, P.T. Usha. “The players should not have protested on the streets. They should have at least waited for the report of the committee. What they have done is not good for the game and the country. It is a negative approach,” Usha said. She also said that the protest “amounts to indiscipline”.

Several wrestlers who have won medals at prestigious international tournaments including Sakshi Malikkh, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia resumed their protest against the WFI chief on April 23, three months after ending their dharna after an oversight committee was probed to examine allegations of sexual harassment. While the report has not yet been made public, the wrestlers say it has not been able to do them justice. The wrestlers are also protesting the Delhi Police’s delay in registering an FIR against Singh.

At a press conference on Monday, Punia, who has been one of the leading faces of the protest, said that the Asian Games were important, but “justice for the daughters” who had been harassed by Singh was even more important. “We want to play, it’s not as if we don’t want to go to the Asian Games,” he said. “But I believe that gaining justice for the daughters of this country is far more important than an Asian medal.” His remarks specific to the Asian Games are because at this time, the players would otherwise have been busy preparing for these games.

Punia also expressed displeasure with the media coverage of the protests, saying that the media seemed to be supporting Singh. “Look at his [Singh’s] criminal record, there’s no questions over that. When we get medals for the country, questions are asked over that,” he said.","Two members of the Commission have told Hindustan Times that everything had been decided on Saturday (about issuing a statement).

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/rights/wrestlers-protest-facts-logic-bjp-supporters,,None,Wrestlers' Protest: Have ‘Facts and Logic’ Finally Started to Kick in With BJP Supporters?,"It is 11 pm. The wrestlers’ protest spot at Jantar Mantar is dimly lit by street lights. The street which was packed with supporters, media crews and police personnel during the day is now practically deserted, except for a handful of protestors, a few constables, and a small group of media persons who even at this late hour are waiting to interview the wrestlers.

A young Sikh is serving dinner in plastic trays to volunteers sitting on the road. A diesel generator powers lights and a fan at the makeshift shelter on the footpath that has become home for the protesting Olympic wrestlers for the last six days.

“Police vaalon ne bijli kaat dee hai (The police have cut the electricity),” mumbles Rahul, a bearded young man with a pronounced Haryanvi accent. I ask him if he is a wrestler as well. He isn’t, he says. He is just here to help the protestors in any capacity he can, as is Aman, a journalism student studying in NOIDA.

Aman comes after his classes every evening to Jantar Mantar, and makes himself available to move mattresses around, serve food and water, and help in any way he can. He tells me he is originally from Varanasi. I ask him if he is (or was) a supporter of Modi’s government.

He says, “Because I am from Varanasi it was but natural for me to be a Modi supporter, as that is also his constituency. But since I am studying to be a journalist, I have to be professionally neutral and base whatever I say only on facts and logic.”

I ask him what facts and logic say about the condition of women in India over the last nine years.

“Mujhe ab sarkaar pe ghinn aa rahee hai (I am feeling contempt for this government),” he replies. “If such accomplished Olympic medalists are sitting on the road for justice, imagine the plight of millions of others in similar situations. The Parliament is next door and yet not one of their MPs has come down here. The wrestlers’ tears tell their truth!”

Aman’s voice starts to rise.

“P.T. Usha’s condemnation of the wrestlers’ protest is trending on Twitter! Imagine! The BJP IT cell is actually trending it! They are defending and protecting a darinda (predator) like this! Something like this has probably never happened before in the history of India! This is shameful!”

Sakshi Malik and her husband Satyavrat (also a wrestler, and Arjun Awardee who has been staying with her on the road) look exhausted.

Satyvrat says, ‘It is not easy to meet thousands of people every day. Everyone affects us. Everyone has a negative or positive vibe and we end up internalising so much of it …” his voice trails off a bit. “But we will fight as long as we have to.”

Sakshi says she must have given at least a hundred interviews that day. I believe her. It was the day the Supreme Court ordered the Delhi police to lodge an FIR against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. One can imagine how long and intense the day would have been.

About 20 metres away from the wrestlers’ enclosure, a group of men are sitting on chairs. I ask them why they are there.

“To show solidarity to our sisters and stand guard here during the night,” one of them, Sunil, a retired pehelwan (wrestler) from Sonepat tells me. “When our younger brothers and sisters win medals, we share in their joy. Shouldn’t we also share in their times of sorrow and difficulty? We are ready to sit here for the next five years if we have to.”

Sunil, incidentally, also tells me has a grouse against ‘left-wing journalists.’ I ask him why. He says it is because they are so good at ‘changing the narrative’. I tell him that is, in fact, the forte of the government and its godi media, who are the true masters of narrative reshaping.

A couple of days prior, an outfit called the United Hindu Front had set up a stall right opposite the wrestlers’ protest. It remained largely empty and not too many seemed interested in what they had to say. A person from the group walked around distributing pamphlets condemning the use of English in India and decrying the decline of naitiktaa (morality) in Indian society. He handed me a pamphlet too.

“How much naitiktaa do you see in the Modi government’s refusal to take Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to task?” I asked him, pointing at the wrestlers.

The chap glared, yanked the pamphlet out of my hand and walked away.

One is beginning to sense cognitive dissonance in many BJP supporters who have come out in support of the wrestlers. On one hand, they are vociferous in their condemnation of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the government’s reluctance to take him to task, and even Modi. On the other hand, they still see themselves as BJP supporters. It is doubtless an unsettling place to be in. Whether they will continue to believe they are living in amrit kaal despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary or eventually succumb to ‘facts and logic’ remains to be seen.

The proverbial penny seems to be dropping for many, but whether it will actually hit the ground with a clear ringing sound, only time will tell.

Watching them at Jantar Mantar, it is obvious that theirs is the world of the wrestling mat, not the arena of public protest. But the unwillingness of the Modi government to take action against Wrestling Federation of India president and six-time BJP MP, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, for alleged sexual harassment has forced them to sit on an indefinite protest in the heart of the national capital.

As crowds of supporters continue to swell daily at Jantar Mantar, the wrestlers themselves prefer to stay in the back of their makeshift tarpaulin shelter, away as much as possible from the nonstop scrutiny of the cameras lined up just outside the police barricade. They give a press conference once a day and try to meet and greet well-wishers as much as they can, but generally keep a low profile, if such a thing were even possible in this situation. The media is not allowed inside their barricaded enclosure.

Early in the morning before the crowds arrive, though, the wrestlers look a bit more relaxed, but it is plain to see the pressure of the situation writ large on their faces.

On Friday, the Supreme Court ordered the Delhi police to lodge an FIR against Brij Bhushan. A couple of days prior, I spoke with Sakshi Malik.

First of all, how are you doing?

(Smiling wryly) You can imagine what it’s like sleeping on the footpath! We have been battling mosquitoes for the last four nights. We trained here on the street this morning and then freshened up at a room nearby. The rest of the time we stay here. We eat and sleep here. It is an effort to keep hope alive, but we have decided that we will sit here till we get justice.

The Prime Minister’s 100th ‘Mann Ki Baat’ episode will be broadcast on April 30, and many people are sending suggestions for topics they would like to see covered. Is there anything you would like him to talk about?

I would like to tell him that a Woman’s Panel should be constituted and their mann ki baat should be heard. Make sure there is a sportswoman on that panel and listen to her mann ki baat as well! Please understand how much we struggle and how many years it takes for us to get anywhere, and the sacrifices we have had to make! It is not easy to win an Olympic medal, you know?

What is making you the saddest about this situation?

My greatest sorrow is not for myself but for what others are going through as a result. I am always concerned about any trouble my parents go through on my account. Look at all the medalists sitting here, and not just the medalists but all the decent, unselfish people who have come here to express their support to us. Will God not listen to their prayers either?

For example, a family came all the way from Bhopal to spend two nights with us here on this footpath, just to show us selfless solidarity. They have a young son, who is probably not more than seven or eight years of age, who also slept here on the footpath for two nights. Other young people barely in their teens are also staying here with us. We have to keep an eye out for them at well as night to make sure nothing bad happens to them.

I feel so bad for people like that but I also marvel at their concern for us. So many people are joining us and that is what is giving us courage.

A lot of farmers are coming to support you…

We come from farmers’ families. My grandfather was a farmer, even though my father came to the city and worked at a government job. I spent my childhood in the village. I have seen farmers struggle, how they work in all seasons, and how they weep when unseasonal rains come. I have seen how they struggle to sell their produce and feed their families. Every day more and more of them are joining us. It gives us a lot of comfort and strength…

Do you have a message for women and girls in India who want to rise above their circumstances?

The reason we are fighting for justice right now is because we don’t want future generations of sportswomen and girls to be wronged as well. I want to tell women, you can raise your voice. Everyone can find courage within themselves! If any woman will raise her voice, she will be heard. Don’t suffer injustice quietly. Raise your voice! Indian women are second to none and their achievements are there for the world to see.

Did you ever think the day would come when you would have to sleep on a footpath?

Never. But I think God has a plan in all of this. I believe very strongly in karma. I know that if I have done anything wrong, then I will immediately reap the fruits. Whatever is happening is in God’s hands. I certainly didn’t want any of this. But so many people have come together. How have they come together? This is all in God’s hands, and whatever result He brings about in the end, I will accept that.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/women/geetanjali-shree-wrestlers-solidarity,,None,'National Shame': International Booker Winner Geetanjali Shree Condemns Atrocity Against Wrestlers,"New Delhi: International Booker winner Geetanjali Shree has expressed solidarity with the wrestlers protesting at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar against the Delhi Police’s prolonged refusal to register an FIR against a BJP MP and the Wrestling Federation of India’s chief, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over serious allegations of sexual harassment levelled against him.

She is the most well known of contemporary writers to have written publicly in support of the wrestlers, who have noted time and again that their voices are being drowned out in favour of Singh because he belongs to the ruling party.

“To obtain simple justice, our ace wrestlers, forsaking their work and security, have been forced to mount an agitation and to approach the Supreme Court. It is painful and a national shame,” Shree said in the statement.

A day ago, the Supreme Court was told by the Delhi Police that it would register an FIR on the matter and that it had found “after preliminary enquiry” that such a step could be taken.

“What as a people have we done to ourselves? Justice should be available as a matter of course and not require agitation and knocking at the Supreme Court’s door,” Shree noted in a statement.

“Even as private a person as me feels constrained to come out of my solitude and condemn this atrocity. That it is to do with our ‘national treasures’, and to do with women, absolutely cannot let anyone be quiet,” she further said.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/women/vinesh-phogat-wrestlers-sakshi-malik-bajrang-brij-bhushan,,None,Why India Should Heed the Cry of Its Wrestlers,"The wrestlers who brought glory to India in the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games, the Asian and World Championships are today fighting cases in the Supreme Court against the state and its de facto instrumentalities like the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and its chief for alleged sexual exploitation of women wrestlers including minors.

This is not a case of the West accusing us of human rights violations. It’s the pride of India, our Olympic and World champions in wrestling, who are claiming to have lifted the veil from what could be the most extensive and most shameful moral decay in a section of our sports infrastructure.

The main allegation

A group of highly decorated wrestlers – Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia and others – have alleged that the head of the WFI – Bharatiya Janata Party MP Brij Bhushan Singh – and other office bearers have been sexually exploiting a large number of women wrestlers for over a decade.

Pressed repeatedly by reporters to give details of the alleged sexual harassment that the wrestlers had faced, Vinesh Phogat said on April 23, 2023: “Main aapko ek do example de sakti hoon. Kisi ladki ko band kamre mein bula ke usko pakad lena, zabardasti uske saath koi harkat karne ki koshish karna… wo kya hai ? Wo sexual harassment hai, wo kya hai?” (‘Calling a girl in a closed room and grabbing her, and then trying to forcibly do something wrong with her, is that not sexual harassment? What is that?)

Complaining to Prime Minister Modi

Earlier in January 2023, giving another example of the sexual exploitation of women wrestlers, Vinesh Phogat said: “Lucknow mein camp kyun lagaya jaata hai, humne pradhan mantri se, khel mantri se humne subko request karke letter bhi…. shoshan wahan easily hota hai… (‘Why are camps being held in Lucknow? We requested the prime minister and sports minister, and in writing to… exploitation happens easily there’ ) (the words in bold were completed by her colleague Sakshi Malik).

Prime Minister Modi has said he personally knows not only Vinesh Phogat but her entire family. While consoling Phogat for failing to win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, Modi had said to the wrestler: ‘Kya beta, bahut gussa aa gaya? Apne aap pe gussa kyon karti ho, haan?… Vinesh, main to tumhare poore parivaar ko jaanta hoon…. Varna, aisa karo, hafte das din ke baad mummy bahno sub mere yahan aao.” (‘Child, don’t be angry with yourself. I know your whole family, so come and see me in a week or 10 days with your mother and sisters’).

Yet Vinesh Phogat along with Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia – the three champions spearheading the agitation for action against Brij Bhushan Singh on sexual harassment charges – chose to agitate on the streets, not once but twice, to tell the whole world about the alleged deep rot in the Wrestling Federation of India.

Why did she and they do that?

This week, Phogat again told the media, “Maine pradhan mantri ko inki [Brij Bhushan Singh] shikayat kar di thi jo jo mere saath hua tha . Tokyo ke baad mein unhone mujko bulaya tha. Main apni family ke saath gayi thi…”. (‘I complained to the Prime Minister about him [Brij Bhushan Singh], about what happened with me. [The PM] called me after Tokyo, and I went with my family…’)

The prime minister on his part has publicly voiced extreme concern at the way women are treated in general. On August 15, 2022, he told the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort: “Lekin mere bhitar ka dard mein kahan kahun…humari bolchal mein, humarey wyawhar mein, humarey kuchh shabdo mein hum nari ka apman karte hain. Kya hum swabhav sey, sanskar sey, rojmarsh ki zindagi mein nari ko apmanit karnewale har baat se mukti ka sankalp le sakte hain?” (Where should I reveal the pain inside me.. In our day to day conversation, in our behaviour, in some of our words, we insult women. Can we not – in our nature, our sanskar, in our day to day life – pledge to stay away from any such talk which insults women?).

If Vinesh Phogat had apprised Modi of the alleged sexual assault/harassment of women wrestlers, including herself, as claimed by her, then it would be reasonable to expect there to have been initiation of some action by the prime minister.

Surely, an enquiry should/would have been ordered. If so, what were its findings? The unprecedented dharna by wrestlers at Jantar Mantar in January 2023 and its renewal this week despite Prime Minister Modi apparently being made aware of the allegations of sexual assault/harrasment of women wrestlers, would indicate that either the allegations were found to be baseless, or, possibly, that the rot was too deep for the truth to come out easily in a short time.

The silence of the BJP top brass is deeply disturbing.

The return to Jantar Mantar

The dharna was called off in January 2023 after the Union government ordered a formal investigation by a seven-member committee which is headed by Olympic medalist Mary Kom, a Modi government-nominated member of the Rajya Sabha, and whose members include Olympics medallist Yogeshwar Dutt who has twice contested an election on a BJP ticket. At that time, Vinesh Phogat had told Rajdeep Sardesai of India Today TV that feelers were being sent for a patch up between the WFI and the complainants. That apparently did not happen, and this week the wrestlers returned to Jantar Mantar. The protesting wrestlers have now demanded that not only should the FIR filed by the seven wrestlers be registered, but that their names should not be disclosed publicly in keeping with the law governing sexual harassment allegations, that the recommendations and findings of the seven-member committee be made known, and that Brij Bhushan Singh be arrested and prosecuted.

Enter the Supreme Court

In view of the delay by the police in registering the FIR, the wrestlers moved the Supreme Court, which not only issued notice to the Police Commissioner, but observed (as reported in the Indian Express), “There are serious allegations of sexual harassment in the petition, which is instituted by professional international wrestlers who have represented India”, that the matter merited urgency, and that “the matter requires the consideration of this court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution”.

In interview after interview, Vinesh Phogat and her colleagues had said that the wrestlers did not want to reveal the names of the sexually harassed wrestlers. In that context, the Supreme Court observed, “For the purpose of these proceedings, the identity of the petitioners shall be redacted and the cause title be read as ‘XYZ and Others vs State NCT of Delhi and others’”.

On April 28, 2023, the Supreme Court was informed by counsel for Delhi Police that it will register the FIR of the complainants against BJP MP Brij Bhushan Singh. The case is expected to be heard again next week. Significantly, the counsel for the complainants has asked for a court monitored investigation, which was opposed by the solicitor general.

In view of (1) the inordinate delay in registering the FIR in a matter that involved a cognizable offence, (2) the vulnerability of the complainants (one of whom is a minor) and the alleged attempts to pressurise them and their parents, (3) the profile of the accused BJP MP, (4) the fact that the matter was being enquired into by a ministry headed by Anurag Thakur in respect of whom the Supreme Court has in a separate case of alleged hate speech asked Delhi Police why an FIR has not been registered against him, and (5) the seriousness of the issues involved, as observed by the CJI himself while issuing notice to Delhi Police, it is likely that there could be a court monitored investigation into the complaints filed by the wrestlers.

The political fallout

The opposition has been served an explosive issue on a platter by the Modi government. The protesting wrestlers who initially wanted to keep their grievances apolitical and had turned away politicians like Brinda Karat from Jantar Mantar in January 2023, are now welcoming political support. A matter that could have been addressed by initiating timely action against Brij Bhushan Singh, regardless of his political clout in east Uttar Pradesh, may now become an alarming political liability for the BJP, besides jeopardising the BJP’s ‘beti bachao’ initiative – which could become a subject of public ridicule. There is no doubt that the BJP has lost ground due to this explosive allegation and the subsequent filing of FIRs against Brij Bhushan Singh. A Supreme Court monitored investigation, if ordered, would be a further setback to the BJP’s claims to be a party committed to women empowerment.

The need for justice

Never in the history of Indian sports has an allegation of sexual harassment of such extensive proportion surfaced.

The opposition may find it hard to resist the temptation to use the court process as a political tool to hurt the BJP but the affected wrestlers have nothing to gain from its politicisation. On January 21, 2023, CJI D.Y. Chandrachud had, inter alia, said: “The philosophy of the constitution is premised on the supremacy of the constitution, rule of law…. freedom and dignity of the individual and integrity of the nation”.

It is hoped that the rule of law shall prevail, and the dignity of our athletes shall be protected. For that to happen, justice must be delivered in this case, and in all such cases, in a time-bound manner.

On April 28, the Solicitor General informed the Supreme Court that it had decided to register a first information report (FIR) on complaints of sexual harassment and misconduct against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, president of the Wrestling Federation of India and a sitting member of parliament from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

In law, an FIR is registered on information of a cognizable offence. The government’s submission on April 28 regarding the registration of an FIR is an acknowledgment that a cognizable offence had been committed. What then explains the delay and resistance to filing an FIR in the first instance?

From what is available in the public domain, even a minor has made a complaint, which automatically attracts serious provisions under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The Act mandates that any person who has knowledge that an offence has been committed shall provide such information to the local police and failure to report the commission of such offence is itself punishable.

Additionally, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, makes it obligatory upon an employer to provide a safe workplace, provide assistance to women to file a complaint in relation to an offence under the Indian Penal Code or any other law, and treat sexual harassment as misconduct under the service rules.

When the president of a sporting federation is accused of sexual misconduct, the Indian Olympic Association, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, failed to take appropriate action as mandated by law. The Wrestling Federation of India appears to have abdicated all responsibility that legally accrues when complaints are received.

Reports show that women wrestlers made complaints of incidents of sexual harassment that date back to 2016. The women have alleged that there have been attempts to intimidate and threaten them for lodging their complaints. This incident shows how women continue to face difficulty in registering complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace against those who outrank them in privilege and power. In this case, the person accused is not only the head of the federation but also has the backing of political influence.

Just a few years ago, the MeToo platform was condemned saying women had not followed due process and it was argued that women had chosen to publicly expose the sexual misdemeanours of their male colleagues and superiors in a way that was not just or fair.

Women used the MeToo platform because there was institutional failure to address their grievances. Ironically, the women wrestlers sought institutional redress, and yet it took a Supreme Court petition to force the Delhi Police into assuring that an FIR would be registered.

It is clear that often, complaints of sexual harassment do not receive redressal or recognition until sustained public action is organised. The courage of women who speak up must be lauded as they often open themselves up not only to social backlash, but even the possibility of defamation proceedings being initiated against them.

It must be noted that the wrestlers protesting are men and women who are putting their sporting careers at risk by making their allegations public. It also invites the following question: if this is the plight of athletes of stature who are able to easily access public platforms, what are the obstacles faced by ordinary women? The issue of sexual harassment of women, it must be remembered, is pervasive and transcends professions and workplaces.

What this incident has also established is that often, an offence of sexual harassment and assault is committed by the same individual and failure to hold him to account results in normalisation of such conduct. The fact that multiple women from the same federation have disclosed instances of harassment at the hands of the WFI president establishes a culpable pattern of sexual misconduct.

Government bodies must be held to a higher standard of accountability in order to renew women’s confidence in the law. This is the responsibility that we have not only to athletes who represent our nation, but also to ordinary citizens.

The writer is a senior advocate at the Supreme Court.","It is a national shame that it took several rounds of protests by our women wrestlers before the Delhi Police responded to their allegations of sexual harassment.
Reports show that women wrestlers made complaints of incidents of sexual harassment that date back to 2016.
Ironically, the women wrestlers sought institutional redress, and yet it took a Supreme Court petition to force the Delhi Police into assuring that an FIR would be registered.
It is clear that often, complaints of sexual harassment do not receive redressal or recognition until sustained public action is organised.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/law/supreme-court-brij-bhushan-bjp-wrestlers-delhi-police,,None,Delhi Police Tells SC It Will Register FIR Against BJP MP on the Basis of Wrestlers' Complaints,"New Delhi: Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta, has told the Supreme Court that the Delhi Police, in its preliminary enquiry, found that the allegations of sexual harassment by India’s top wrestlers against Bharatiya Janata Party MP and Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh disclose commission of a cognisable offence, warranting the registration of an FIR.

The wrestlers, who include Olympics, Commonwealth and world championships medal winners, have been sitting in at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi since last weekend.

An apex court bench of the Chief Justice of India, D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice P.S. Narasimha is hearing a writ petition filed by the complainants.

While the complainants, through their senior counsel, Kapil Sibal, underlined the need to monitor the investigation by the court, SG Mehta argued that the bench needs to leave it to the Delhi Police Commissioner.

The bench has decided not to dispose of the case, but to hear it again next Friday, so that it can know of the degree to which its directions have been complied with.

In particular, the bench directed the Delhi Police Commissioner, Sanjay Arora, to provide adequate security to the minor victim in the case, and to make an independent assessment of threat perception to the other complainants, and if required, provide adequate security to them as well.

In today’s hearing, the petitioners, through Kapil Sibal, submitted an affidavit in a sealed cover, and expressed their concern about the safety of the minor victim. The bench directed the sharing of the affidavit with the Delhi Police Commissioner through the SG, on the condition that utmost confidentiality be maintained about the identity of the minor victim.

Meanwhile, the wrestlers have said that the police might file a loose and that they don’t trust it. “We we will see, observe then take a decision (on calling off the protest),” World Championship medallist Vinesh Phogat told PTI.

We don’t trust Delhi Police, it might file a loose FIR: wrestlers — Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) April 28, 2023

‘Something else playing out’: SG

SG Mehta contended that it is a sensitive issue, and while he is not against the intervention by the court as such, he alleged that “there is something else which is playing out” in the case.

He told the bench that there is a tendency to approach the court under Article 32 “in every such case,” and demand the monitoring of the investigation by a retired judge of the court, when the petitioners have other legal remedies available, in the absence of registration of FIR by the police.

The petitioners brought to the notice of the bench that there are 40 cases including those under section 302 of the IPC, which are pending against the accused, Singh, in the case, and there has been no action by the authorities, despite the complainants bringing the allegations to their knowledge much earlier.

The SG said that there cannot be monitoring of the case by two courts – the jurisdictional court and the constitutional court, that is, the Supreme Court.

When Sibal said he would like to make legal submissions in the case next Friday, the CJI observed that it is an evolving situation, and the court would like to keep an open mind on the issue.","The wrestlers, who include Olympics, Commonwealth and world championships medal winners, have been sitting in at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi since last weekend.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/sport/abhinav-bindra-neeraj-chopra-nikhat-zareen-wrestlers,,None,India's Only Two Individual Olympic Gold Medallists Have Now Voiced Support for Protesting Wrestlers,"New Delhi: A day after Indian Olympic Association chief P.T. Usha said the ongoing protest by wrestlers “amounted to indiscipline,” top athletes of the country like Neeraj Chopra and Nikhat Zareen have tweeted their support to the medal-winning wrestlers who are protesting at Jantar Mantar against the police’s refusal to lodge an FIR against a BJP MP accused of sexual harassment by six women and a minor.

The wrestlers are protesting against the lack of an FIR against Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who is battling serious allegations including those which should come under the POCSO Act.

Their protest, which follows a similar sit-in in January this year which was suspended after the Union government assured them of an investigation, has not seen any attention from the government this time.

Worlds medallist Vinesh Phogat, who has led the protests alongside Olympics medallists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, had also slammed the country’s cricketers over their silence. Since she spoke, India’s first World Cup winning cricket caption, Kapil Dev, has uploaded an Instagram story asking, ‘Will they ever get justice?’ with a photo of the protesting wrestlers.

On Friday, April 28, javelin thrower and one of India’s most successful Olympians, Neeraj Chopra, tweeted a note on Friday, saying, “What’s happening should never happen.” Chopra’s tweet is significant because he is easily the most high profile of working athletes to have made his stand clear on the issue.

Abhinav Bindra, who is one of two Indians to have ever won individual Olympic gold – the other is Chopra – had tweeted his support on April 26.

“As athletes, we train hard every day to represent our country on the international stage. It is deeply concerning to see our athletes finding it necessary to protest on the streets regarding the allegations of harassment in the Indian wrestling administration. My heart goes out to all those who have been affected,” he said.

“We must ensure that this issue is handled properly, with the athletes’ concerns heard and addressed fairly and independently. This incident highlights the crucial need for a proper safeguarding mechanism that can prevent harassment and ensure justice for those affected. We must work towards creating a safe and secure environment for all athletes to thrive in,” Bindra said.

Boxing World Champion Nikhat Zareen has also tweeted today, noting that it breaks her heart to see bright sportspersons “in this state.”

The wrestlers, who include Olympics, Commonwealth and world championships medal winners, have been sitting in at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi since last weekend. Indian Express has reported how Worlds’ medallist Vinesh Phogat has pointed to the silence of top cricketers on the matter.

One of India’s most successful Olympians, javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, tweeted a note on Friday, saying, “What’s happening should never happen.”

India’s only other Olympic gold medallist, Abhinav Bindra, had tweeted his support to the wrestlers on April 26.

A day ago, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief P.T. Usha had said the ongoing protest by wrestlers was “not good for the game and the country”, and told them to wait until the report of a committee that is looking into their allegations was made public. She said the protest “amounts to indiscipline,” leading the wrestlers’ and several other commentators to note that they were disappointed by her stand.

On April 27, representatives led a protest in the national capital and some of them were detained by police.

The letter notes that the women’s organisations are “appalled at the unabashed refusal of Delhi Police in filing the FIR as is mandated by law.”

“Here’s a complaint of sexual harassment, Mr CP, by India’s star women wrestlers of international fame, who have brought laurels to the country. How are we projecting India when our top sportswomen, including Olympic medallists who bring honour and prestige to the country by winning medals internationally are forced to sit in dharna demanding justice.”

The signatories are representatives from the All India Democratic Women’s Association, the All India Mahila Sanskritik Sangathan, the All India Progressive Women’s Association, the Centre for Struggling Women, the National Federation of Indian Women, the Pragatisheel Mahila Sangathan, the Purogami Mahila Sangathan Sucharita and the Swastik Mahila Samiti Kusum Sehgal.

The memorandum further says that when the wrestlers had last protested in January of this year, they had ended the protest after having been assured of an investigation.

“The investigation that turned out to be anything but transparent. They, therefore, had no choice but to come back asking for the report of the oversight committee which probed the wrestlers’ allegations. All they demand is a fair investigation.”

The letter also slams the apparent motives of law enforcers.

“The sexual harassment by the WFI chief and some other coaches employed by WFI is deeply concerning. Instead of supporting women (remember “beti bachao,…”), what we see is a callous attitude and deaf ears to their deafening cries for justice. All this for shielding a politician of the ruling dispensation?

It poses two vital questions to the Commissioner of Police:

1. Since when have we decided to first conduct a preliminary investigation before an FIR is filed?

2. Isn’t an FIR itself a preliminary first step towards proceeding with the case?

Registering their outrage the representatives have demanded the registration of an FIR without further delay and fast-tracked investigations into the serious charges, including those under the POCSO Act which deals with sexual harassment of minors.

“The sportswomen and the women of this country are determined not to backtrack on this issue. Remember “nari shakti” that is invoked time and again by the powers that be,” the memorandum notes.","The wrestlers, who include Olympics, Commonwealth and world championships medal winners, have been sitting in at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi since last weekend.

Usha for Calling Their Protest 'Indiscipline',"New Delhi: The wrestlers who are demanding action against BJP MP and Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brijbhushan Singh said they are “hurt” by Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief P.T. Usha’s criticism of their protest.

Usha said the ongoing protest by wrestlers was “not good for the game and the country”, and told them to wait until the report of a committee that is looking into their allegations was made public. She said the protest “amounts to indiscipline”.

“The players should not have protested on the streets. They should have at least waited for the report of the committee. What they have done is not good for the game and the country. It is a negative approach,” Usha said, according to NDTV. The wrestlers had written to Usha asking her to act on their demands.

“Our feeling is that for sexual harassment complaints, IOA has a committee and athletes’ commission. Instead of going to the street (again), they should have come to us, but they have not at all come to IOA,” Usha told reporters after the sports body’s executive committee meeting, according to Indian Express.

She also went on to say, “They are sitting on a dharna and asking all political parties to join them, and that is what disappoints me.”

Wrestlers hit back

Responding to Usha’s criticism, Sakshi Malik, one of the protesting wrestlers, said, “We feel hurt by P.T. Usha’s comment. She is not supporting us despite being a woman herself. What indiscipline have we done? We are sitting here peacefully. If we had got justice, we would not have done this.”

Wrestler Vinesh Phogat said she had tried to reach Usha over the phone but did not receive any response from her. “… We don’t know whether she is under some kind of pressure,” she added. “When Olympic medallists from the nation are sitting on the streets in protest, I think PT Usha ma’am should have come to us. She should have asked us why we were in tears.”

Bajrang Punia called Usha’s statement “shocking”. “She herself was an athlete and she is also a woman. We did not expect this harsh reaction from her, we expected support,” a flustered Bajrang Punia told PTI.

Several wrestlers who have won medals at prestigious international tournaments resumed their protest against the WFI chief on April 23, three months after ending their dharna after an oversight committee was probed to examine allegations of sexual harassment. While the report has not yet been made public, the wrestlers say it has not been able to do them justice.

The findings of a six-member oversight panel that submitted its report on April 5 have not yet been made public by the sports ministry. The Delhi Police in the Supreme Court on April 26 said it “felt” that “some preliminary inquiry” may be needed before registering an FIR on the sexual harassment complaints against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, in his urgent mentioning for the police on Wednesday, justified the non-registration of the FIR by highlighting the “need” for a “preliminary inquiry”. Though he also added that if the court felt an FIR was required to be registered immediately, the police would definitely do so.

The Indian Express has interviewed the physio who told the newspaper that he had told the women’s coach Kuldeep Malik about this and also shared details formally while appearing before the oversight committee set up by the Sports Ministry. He appeared before them in February, once in person and then on a video call.

The newspaper says it could get no response from Brij Bhushan Singh or Kuldeep Malik.

The Hindu reports that wrestlers have upped the ante on their charges with wrestler Sakshi Malik reaching out to PM Modi and Women and Child welfare minister Smriti Irani, questioning their silence on the matter, “Modi ji talks Beti Bachao and calls us home when we win medals, talks about Mann ki Baat. This time we want him to listen to our Mann ki Baat, maybe he isn’t aware of our complaints so far. Why is Smriti Irani ji silent so far?”

Well, two of Haryana’s world-renowned daughters – Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik – along with other international medal-winning wrestlers, are once again obliged to be protesting on a Jantar Mantar pavement in the capital city of New Delhi against, as they have been claiming, persistent sexual harassment of women wrestlers by the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, six times member of parliament from the ruling BJP.

Welcome to “party with a difference” that sets high store by the so-high-minded values of Sanatan Dharma.

When you recall with what demonstrative alacrity Narendra Modi greets such ones when they return from abroad with international laurels, you would have thought that their shaming plight would have brought him out to be by their side, leaving electioneering to satraps.

Far from any such thing, these national treasures have not succeeded in persuading the Delhi Police even to file a mandatory FIR in the matter.

Given that one of the seven complaining daughters of India is a minor, inviting the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act provisiona, the refusal by the Delhi police to file a first information report (FIR) points but to one thing – that the police may not be as “free” an agent as we are asked to believe.

Is it to be thought that the all-knowing numero uno has not heard of this matter yet?

The more fool you if you so believe.

After their initial protest at Jantar Mantar when they scrupulously disallowed any “political” agent to use their platform, a Committee was set up to look into their complaint.

How them committees come to the rescue of the dissembling state you may not wonder.

The Committees’ Report, unsurprisingly, remains under wraps, barring the leak that it has skirted the specific issue of their complaint against the chief, Brij Bhushan, and recommended closer interaction between players and administration.

Was there ever a more familiar non-sequitur?

The complainants have had no choice but to approach the top court, which, upon hearing the redoubtable Kapil Sibal, has encouragingly observed that the matter is a “serious” one, and issued notices to the Delhi Police and the Wrestling Federation, returnable on Friday, April 28.

Long live the Supreme Court.

One may ask, as these so-distinguished daughters of India who have brought glory to Bharat hold back their tears, sitting and sleeping on a city pavement, where are the thousands who once went to greet them on their triumphant return from international wrestling events?

Were these fair-weather followers who appear when the going is good, and disappear when the clouds gather, especially the dark ones that challenge the sunny, vote-catching affirmations of the powers that be?

How many Bharatis truly do care for daughters, especially when not their own, and still more especially when the wolves who prey on them wear official lapels on their patriotic hearts?

Most heinously, news is that under the watch of this federation chief, who was once also an accused under the stringent TADA law, hoodlums are busy threatening the girls whose names have come to be leaked unlawfully.

Reports suggest that they are sought to be “persuaded” in every conceivable way to drop their allegations, or else.

And the likes of Phogat and Malik are sought to be maligned as wrestlers who are past their prime and thus busy calumniating the federation chief; the fact is that these wrestlers continue to be in prime standing and performance.

Their request that the chief be subjected to a narco test, one that they are willing to be so subjected to themselves, so that the truth be out thus far finds no takers.

Is it not time that the long-standing sordid control of entrenched politicians over India’s sports federations be ended, and outstanding sportswomen and sportsmen be asked to take over the running of these federations?

Know that the stakes, both financially and politically, are too high for such a thing to happen any time soon.

Of course, had this been the case of a Suresh Kalmadi (remember Commonwealth Games?) instead of a Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, the latter’s party would have gone to town to seek his Congress head.

Watch | Protesting Wrestlers Say They Are Receiving Threats for Complaint Against WFI Chief

Tailpiece

Do recall how the Delhi Police scooted with dispatch to 12, Tughlak Road, once the residence of Rahul Gandhi, in order to seek an explanation from him on a remark he had made at the conclusion of his Bharat Jodo Yatra in Srinagar.

They did so in their grave anxiety to follow up on his information that some women he said had shared with him there, to the effect that they had been sexually harassed.

Thus, the great protector of women, the Delhi Police, lost no time to dash to him so as to efficiently investigate the matter and punish the guilty.

You may well ask why it is that the publicly voiced plight of India’s women wrestlers, put in written complaint to the police, has not drawn the same sort of anxiety on behalf of the betis of India (and famous ones at that), and prompted the police to make a dash for Jantar Mantar as they did to 12, Tughlak Road.

Is it, after all, yet again the case where the establishment says “show me the face (especially of the culprit) and I will show you the law”?

Several wrestlers who have won medals at prestigious international tournaments resumed their protest against the WFI chief on April 23, three months after ending their dharna after an oversight committee was probed to examine allegations of sexual harassment. While the report has not yet been made public, the wrestlers say it has not been able to do them justice.

According to the news agency PTI, the wrestlers said on Wednesday, April 26, that they are “surprised that PM Modi felicitates them and clicks pictures with them when they win medals but now he has turned a blind eye to their plight when they are on road, seeking justice”.

“PM Modi sir talks about ‘Beti Bachao’ and ‘Beti Padhao’, and listens to everyone’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’. Can’t he listen to our ‘mann ki baat’? He invites us to his home when we win medals and gives us a lot of respect and calls us his daughters. Today, we appeal to him that he listens to our ‘Mann Ki Baat’,” said Sakshi Malik, who won a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

Malik also asked why Union women development minister Smriti Irani was silent. “We are not being allowed [by Delhi Police] to prepare food and train, why are you silent? I just want to say that you come here, listen to us and support us,” added Malik.

Vinesh Phogat, who has won multiple medals at the Commonwealth Games and Wrestling Championships, told PTI that the protesting wrestlers do not have the telephone numbers of people who can help in reaching out to the prime minister. “So we are appealing to PM Modi through [the] media to raise issues. Maybe he can then listen to your cries. Our souls are almost dead, maybe he will see,” she said, according to the news agency.

“He does his programme ‘Mann ki Baat’ but has he, even for a minute given a thought to our ‘Mann ki Baat’, how much dilemma, does he think we face that daughters of the nation are sitting on the roads and are on the cusp of quitting wrestling by standing against a big criminal?” she continued.

Bajrang Punia, who won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, also appealed to Prime Minister Modi to “do justice” to the daughters of India.

The wrestlers told The Wire‘s Arfa Khanum Sherwani on Tuesday that many of them were receiving threatening calls. They said that the names of the complainants have been leaked to Singh, and they are concerned for the safety of the victims.

Vinesh Phogat asked all athletes to extend support. “Can’t we put greed, fear and self-interest behind us? I appeal to all sportspersons of the nation, Olympic medallists, national medallists and world championship medallists to come together and stay united. If we come together, there is no reason why we can’t be number one nation in Olympics one day,” she said, according to PTI.

Satya Pal Malik extends support

Former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik met the wrestlers on Wednesday and said “it was a matter of shame” that athletes have been forced to take to the streets to fight for justice.

“When our daughters win medals and unfurl the tri-colour, at that time very shamelessly, we invite them for tea to honour them and to click pictures with them, and today they are on road. We should drown in shame,” Malik said, according to PTI.

“I appeal to all of you that you support them till their fight ends and this gathering should get bigger and bigger,” Malik said.

Malik, who has been critical of the Modi government recently, said it was unfortunate that women wrestlers are asked to provide evidence of sexual exploitation.

“It is not just your fight, it is a battle for dignity of our daughters. Chaudhary Charan Singh used to say that if a woman is complaining of sexual exploitation, she should not be questioned and no evidence should be demanded from her. We must accept and trust what they are saying,” he said, according to PTI.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/law/wrestlers-petition-fir-brij-bhushan-wfi-sexual-harassment,,None,Wrestlers' Petition for FIR Against WFI President: SC to Examine If Enquiry Needed Before FIR,"New Delhi: Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court today, April 26, that the Delhi Police feels that it ought to initiate a preliminary enquiry in the sexual harassment allegations against BJP MP and Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, before registering a first information report, as directed by the court earlier.

SG Mehta said this before a bench of Chief Justice of India, D.Y.Chandrachud.

The bench of the CJI and Justice P.S. Narasimha had issued notice in the case on Tuesday, April 25. Top wrestlers of the country – including Olympic, Commonwealth and world championship medallists – are protesting at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar against the Delhi Police’s purported refusal to register an FIR against serious allegations of sexual harassment including that of a minor against Singh.

CJI Chandrachud told Mehta that he could present the material which, according to him, justifies a preliminary enquiry before FIR in this case to the hearing bench on Friday, April 28.

“Normally, I am averse to the Court looking at any material, without showing it to the other side, but in this case, we will examine whether there is really any merit in what you are requesting,” he said.

When the SG told the CJI that he wanted to mention it because it should not appear that the Delhi Police is not complying with the court’s mandate to register FIR in this case, the CJI replied: “It’s all right”.

Senior advocate, Kapil Sibal, appearing on the other side, said he would like to file an affidavit. The CJI took note of his submission.

Olympic medalist Sakshi Malik, who is among the protesting wrestlers who recently spoke to The Wire, expressing her frustration with the government’s lack of response to their demands for justice. Malik stated that she and her fellow athletes will not leave the protest site until their voices are heard and suggested that there may be government pressure to prevent the filing of an FIR.

According to another Olympic medalist Bajrang Punia, the complaint had been lying unattended for three months. “I believe police are not filing the FIR because of pressure from someone,” he told The Wire.

Protesting wrestlers said on Sunday, April 23, that even though they had filed a police complaint at Connaught Place police station, with details of six women and one minor girl accusing Singh of sexual misconduct, no FIR had been filed yet. Cops have been repeatedly instructed by courts to act quickly in cases where the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act can be invoked.

Among those protesting are Olympics medallists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia and Worlds medallists Vinesh Phogat and Deepak Punia.

Hearing Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared on behalf of the country’s leading wrestlers, Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud noted that a remedy to approach the Police Superintendent is available under Section 156 of the Criminal Procedure Code, reported LiveLaw.

Noting that the wrestlers staging a sit-in at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar, Sibal said, “Seven women have complained and one is a minor. The FIRs have not been registered. The law of this court has been violated.”

The court said, “There are serious allegations at the behest of professional wrestlers concerning sexual harassment. Issue notice returnable on Friday.”

The court also granted the petitioners the right to conceal their identities.

On April 23, Vinesh Phogat, one of India’s leading wrestlers had tagged CJI Chandrachud on her Twitter note alleging lack of action against Singh.

In January, the Union sports ministry had formed a committee in the aftermath of an unprecedented protest by the country’s most successful wrestlers, in which they alleged grave wrongdoings by the WFI and especially its chief, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Singh was asked to “step aside” by the Union sports ministry.

However, the wrestlers who had earlier said that the committee was consulted without their inputs, said that its reports were not made public either.","Hearing Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared on behalf of the country’s leading wrestlers, Chief Justice of India D.Y.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/politics/brij-bhushan-sharan-singh-profile,,None,"Who Is BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, at the Heart of Serious Charges By Wrestlers?","New Delhi: “I have committed a murder in the past. Let people say what they want…I did commit a murder.”

This is not the confession of a convicted criminal, but a bold declaration made by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a BJP leader and six-time Lok Sabha MP who has never been tried for murder.

Though tales of the muscle power wielded by Singh, the MP from the Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh, are well-known, especially in Gonda and its surrounding districts, it is likely that no one knew that Singh had committed a murder until an interview he gave to a web portal in 2022. His affidavit submitted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections did mention four criminal cases, including one under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 307 (attempt to murder) and other serious crimes.

Singh has also been the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) since 2011, and there are allegations that he often resorts to the use of muscle power in running the federation. As a result of his tyrannical attitude, Olympic-level wrestlers were forced to hold a protest against him, staging a dharna at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar from January 18.

The protestors made serious allegations against Singh, including sexual harassment of women wrestlers, physical abuse, dictatorial functioning and financial irregularities in the management of WFI. The players called off the protest after a late-night meeting with sports minister Anurag Thakur on January 20, in which they were given an assurance that Singh would be relieved of his duties as WFI president and an inquiry committee would be set up.

Now, saying that they have lost faith in the committee, the wrestlers are back on protest. They have filed a police complaint against Singh, which also includes allegations of sexual assault on a minor. However, the police are yet to register an FIR – and the protesting wrestlers have said they will not leave Jantar Mantar until an FIR is filed. They have even approached the Supreme Court on the matter.

Meanwhile, regarding the allegations levelled against him, Singh claimed that he would hang himself if the charges were found to be true. He refused to resign from his post as president, calling the allegations politically motivated and terming it a Congress-sponsored protest. He even warned that if he opened his mouth, it would bring a ‘tsunami’. He compared the wrestlers’ protest with the Shaheen Bagh protest and added that a few players whose careers are over are levelling allegations against him.

However, Singh, who calls the protesting sportspersons as pawns of the Congress, does not have a slate as clean as he pretends. While he himself proclaimed on camera that he has committed a murder, on another occasion he reportedly confessed that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had held him responsible for “another murder”.

The many crimes of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh

Ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Scroll had quoted senior journalists from Gonda district as saying that Singh’s involvement in crime in the 1980s ranged from motorcycle/bike theft to running liquor shops. He even used to get boys to hunt for coins lying at the bottom of temple ponds. Soon he became a civil contractor. Vinod Kumar Singh alias Pandit Singh, a former minister in the Samajwadi Party cabinet in UP, was his associate in all these activities.

Later, Brij Bhushan and Pandit Singh turned from friends to foes and in 1993 Brij Bhushan was charged under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (spreading nuisance), 148 (possessing deadly weapon) and 149 (offence committed by every member of an unlawful assembly with common object) for shooting at Pandit Singh. Pandit Singh had claimed in an interview to Scroll that 20 bullets were fired at him and he was hospitalised for 14 months.

In the case which lasted for 29 years, Brij Bhushan was acquitted in December last year due to the lack of evidence. However, the court pulled up the investigators, saying that during the investigation no effort was made to collect evidence and even the weapon used in the crime could not be recovered.

In his defence, Brij Bhushan had argued that he was in Delhi at the time of the attack. In response, the judge said that no effort was made by the investigators to verify this claim, which makes the entire investigation questionable.

Pandit Singh, the victim in the case, died in May 2021 after contracting COVID-19 about a year and a half before the verdict. One of the reasons for Brij Bhushan’s acquittal in this case was that Pandit Singh did not appear to record a statement against him. When asked why in an interview in 2014, the latter replied, “If I decide to testify against Brij Bhushan in the 1993 firing case, I can get him behind bars. But I have restrained myself from doing so because I want to keep him alive. It is fun to fight with a strong person. You stay alert and don’t make mistakes.”

‘… I did commit a murder’

Pandit Singh had a brother, Ravinder Singh, who was a very close friend of Brij Bhushan’s. Both of them were contractors and used to work together. Once they had gone to hold a panchayat meeting where shots were fired in the air and one bullet hit Ravinder while he was standing next to Brij Bhushan. It enraged Bhushan so much that he snatched the rifle from the hands of the person who had fired the shot and shot him. The person died on the spot.

This incident was narrated by Brij Bhushan himself in an interview to the online portal Lallantop. In the interview, he said, “I have committed a murder in the past. Whatever people may say, I did commit a murder. I immediately shot and killed the person who had shot Ravinder dead.”

He further said in the interview that Lallu Singh, who is currently the BJP MP from the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat in Ayodhya district, is a witness to the incident.

He added that some time after the incident, he was sent to jail under the Gangster Act by veteran leader and former minister of Gonda, Kunwar Anand Singh.

Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had also suspected Bhushan of committing another murder, the latter confessed. After the death of the BJP candidate of Gonda Lok Sabha seat, the former prime minister had said, “(You) got him killed.”

Brij Bhushan is a six-time MP, winning five times on a BJP ticket and once (in 2009) on an SP ticket. He won the first two elections in 1991 and 1999 from the Gonda Lok Sabha seat. In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP gave him a ticket from Balrampur and nominated Ghanshyam Shukla from Gonda. Shukla died in a road accident on the day of polling.

Recalling it in a conversation with Scroll, Brij Bhushan said, “My opponents spread rumours that it was not an accident but a murder. Atal ji called me and said,‘Marwa diya (You got him killed).’”

Brij Bhushan added that this led to his differences with the BJP. As a result, he made headlines by cross-voting against his own party in a crucial confidence motion by the opposition against the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2008. The BJP expelled him, but the SP opened its doors for him.

He was elected MP from Kaiserganj Lok Sabha seat in 2009 on an SP ticket. In 2014, he rejoined the BJP and again became an MP from Kaiserganj, repeating his victory in 2019 as well.

It is noteworthy that he remained in the BJP even after the then prime minister had expressed his suspicion of that Bhushan had murdered a BJP candidate. The BJP expelled him only after his cross-vote.

However, Brij Bhushan’s political clout remained unaffected. Despite his confession of having committed a murder and being accused of another murder by the then PM, both the BJP and the opposition SP embraced him and covered up his crimes as he continued to get tickets and win election after election. For more than a decade, he has been the president of a national sports association.

According to the Indian Express, he likes to be referred to as ‘powerful’ and believes that he doesn’t need the BJP as much as the BJP needs him. In his home district of Gonda in Uttar Pradesh and at least half a dozen adjoining districts, he wields a lot of influence.

A local BJP leader from Gonda told the newspaper, “Brij Bhushan only borrows the party symbol, he doesn’t need it to win the election. He wins them on his own.”

He has more than 50 educational institutions running in Bahraich, Gonda, Balrampur, Ayodhya and Shravasti districts of UP which is also a source of his political domination in the region, something he admits.

He said, “I did not establish them (college) with any political motive, but today boys rally around me. People may call me mafia, but my students idolise me. Earlier I used to touch the feet of Brahmins, today young Brahmins touch my feet calling me Guruji.”

This is the reason why Brij Bhushan, who maintains a stature bigger than the party in the region, challenges his own party and its decisions with hardly any adverse consequences.

In October last year, while targeting the BJP government in UP, he said that he had never seen such poor management of floods and that people are at God’s mercy. On a question asked regarding chief minister Adityanath, he said, “Don’t make me say anything.”

In addition, he even praised SP leader Azam Khan, the biggest thorn in the BJP’s side in UP, by calling him a ‘leader of the people’.

In June last year, when Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray expressed his desire to visit Ayodhya, Brij Bhushan went against the party line and opposed Thackeray’s visit at a time when the BJP was considering MNS as an ally during a tumultuous phase of Maharashtrian politics.

“I will not allow Raj Thackeray, who insulted North Indians, to enter Ayodhya until he apologises to all North Indians with folded hands,” he claimed. “I request chief minister Yogi Adityanath to not meet him. The RSS, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the common man played a role in the Ram Mandir movement. The Thackeray family has nothing to do with it.”

He also launched a tirade against yoga guru and businessman Ramdev, accusing his company Patanjali of selling spurious ghee and warned him of a nationwide agitation against Patanjali’s products, terming him the ‘king of adulteration‘. He also called upon the Sant community to stand against Ramdev and appealed to the Centre as well as the UP and Uttarakhand governments to take action against the latter.

Brij Bhushan Singh’s image of a staunch Hindutva leader also corresponds with the political ideology of the BJP. His controversial remarks, for instance, about the ancestors of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, calling them Hindu, only help the BJP’s cause. This is perhaps why his defiance against the party is largely ignored by the top brass.

Brij Bhushan’s long tryst with controversies

Brij Bhushan joined the BJP in the late 1990s having studied law at the Awadh University. It was the era of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and he caught the BJP’s eye because of his good standing in the areas around Ayodhya. Today, his wife Ketki Devi Singh is the Gonda District Panchayat President while his son Prateek Bhushan Singh is the MLA from Gonda Sadar seat.

Brij Bhushan was one of the prominent faces of the Ram Mandir movement and was also arrested along with senior BJP leader L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and former chief minister Kalyan Singh in the Babri demolition case in which he was the main accused. In 2020, the court acquitted all the accused including Brij Bhushan.

In an attempt to cash in on his image as a staunch Hindutva leader, he boasts, “During the movement, I was the first person from the area to be arrested by Mulayam Singh. I was also the first person arrested by the CBI after the controversial structure was demolished.”

In the mid-1990s, his relationship with the underworld also came to the fore. He spent several months in Tihar Jail on charges of harbouring members of the Dawood Ibrahim gang. A case was registered against him under the Terrorist and Divisive Activities Prevention Act (TADA). He was later acquitted due to the lack of evidence.

While he was in jail, his wife contested on the BJP ticket from Gonda Lok Sabha seat and won.

In 2004, Brij Bhushan’s 22-year-old son Shakti Singh died by suicide, leaving a suicide note in which he blamed his father Brij Bhushan for the act. “You could not prove to be a good father. You did not take care of my siblings and me. You always thought about yourself and did not care about us. We see our future in darkness. That’s why there is no point in living now,” the note read.

Tyrannical attitude as wrestling federation head

In managing the WFI, Brij Bhushan has often been accused of being a self-centred narcissist, which is also reflected in his remarks. For instance, he reportedly said in an interview to the Indian Express in 2021, “They (wrestlers) are strong boys and girls. You need someone strong to control them. Is there anyone stronger than me here?”

The report stated how his is the final word in every matter related to wrestling in the federation. He keeps an eye on every minor and major wrestling tournament and often gives instructions to the referee and even punishes the judges.

Referring to a few standout anecdotes about his dictatorial attitude, the report said that he suspended a railway coach during a national championship in Noida in January 2021. He asked the referee to penalise a wrestler from Delhi because the wrestler’s supporters had entered the playing arena. The referee said there was no such rule but Singh insisted upon it.

If he is unable to be physically present at a tournament, he monitors it from home by getting cameras installed everywhere at the venue, something he himself admitted.

The report further added that the wrestlers are well aware of Brij Bhushan’s attitude. Therefore, when they lose in a controversial match, instead of going to the judge, they appeal directly to him.

Meanwhile, scenes of wrestlers bowing before Brij Bhushan and seeking blessings from him are also common during the matches of the national championship in Indian wrestling.

His influence is such that he recently lashed out at the Union government’s ‘Target Olympic Podium (TOP)’ scheme for the preparation of athletes for Olympics, and asked the government not to directly approach the athletes under this scheme.

Meanwhile, after the Tokyo Olympics last year, he had said that the federation would keep an eye on private, non-profit organisations supporting wrestlers.

Speaking to The Print, a former Sports Authority of India coach said, “Brij Bhushan is the goon that wrestling needs. Without him, it would be very difficult to discipline or keep wrestlers under control.”

His hooliganism was witnessed in 2021 during a junior level wrestling tournament in Ranchi, when he started hitting a wrestler on stage.

Dronacharya awardee Mahavir Phogat had also told the media in detail about Singh’s attitude in running the federation and claimed that apart from interfering with the diet of the wrestlers, he also takes half of the sponsorship money they receive.

A group of renowned wrestlers including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and others have reconvened to protest at Jantar Mantar, even spending the night there on Sunday night. They had said that they will continue their protest and not leave Jantar Mantar until an FIR has been filed.

While protesting in January, wrestlers had asked CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat to leave the stage, saying that it was an athletes’ protest and they did not want it to be politicised. This time, however, they have welcomed all political parties to join them if they like – including the BJP, of which Singh is a leader. Last time, they said, they did not accept political support and were “misguided”.

Allegations of sexual harassment

Seven wrestlers have filed a police complaint against Singh, president of the WFI, accusing him of sexual harassment. He was elected president of the WFI for a third consecutive term in February 2019. Singh is also a BJP MP from Kaiserganj, Uttar Pradesh.

Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia confirmed that a police complaint had been lodged at New Delhi’s Connaught Place police station, reported ANI.

A complaint has been filed with the Delhi Commission for Women, too, IE reported. It quoted the commission chief Swati Maliwal as saying that “several women including a minor have alleged that the accused person has indulged in the crime of sexual harassment against them during his tenure at the helm of Wrestling Federation of India”.

ANI also reported on April 23 that Maliwal issued notice to the Delhi Police for reportedly failing to register an FIR in the matter. The wrestlers had told the Commission that they had given a written complaint to Delhi Police two days ago but their FIR had not been registered yet.

Indian Express quoted a police officer saying that they had received a complaint from the wrestlers at the station, and that they had begun their enquiry before filing an FIR.

‘No action being taken’

IE quoted one wrestler as saying that they had taken this step since there has been “no action” taken even though they lodged their protest with the sports ministry. “We are now waiting for the police to take further action,” IE quoted the wrestler as saying.

The wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshee Malikkh, also resumed their sit-down protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on Sunday.

“We have just one issue. The reason for the protest is that nothing has been done so far…We are here to save wrestling. We will sit at 4 pm and talk,” ANI quoted wrestler Punia as saying as he headed to Jantar Mantar on the day.

Wrestlers Phogat and Malikkh broke down while interacting with the media during their sit-down protest on Sunday, ANI reported.

“We have been going through mental torture, it’s about the respect of women athletes…We aren’t receiving any response from Sports Ministry, it’s been three months,” said Phogat and other wrestlers at the protest.

“A news report recently claimed that one of the members of the oversight committee, which was constituted by the sports ministry to probe the allegations, was not in agreement with its final report. It indicates something suspicious is being done either by the committee or the ministry. Someone is doing something wrong,” Punia told The News Indian Express.

On January 23, after weeks of protest by a number of prominent Indian wrestlers, the Union sports ministry constituted a six-member committee headed by Olympic medallist and boxer Mary Kom. The other members of the committee were former CEO of Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) Capt Rajagopalan, former SAI Executive Director (Teams) Radhika Sreeman, former badminton national champion Trupti Murgunde, Olympic bronze medallist Yogeshwar Dutt and Commonwealth wrestling champion Babita Phogat. Phogat was added only after wrestlers expressed displeasure at the committee’s membership.

One of the members of the committee told Sportstar on the condition anonymity that they had objections to the way the committee’s report was drafted and so have signed it with objections.

“Members of the committee had to sign the report before it was submitted to the Sports Ministry. I wrote on the report that I will sign with objections to this report,” the member said. “I was not allowed to read the final report in full and I had objected about it. The report was submitted to the Sports Ministry on the April 5 and that morning, I realised that certain objections I had earlier raised had not been included in the report. When I asked the committee to include these points, this was not done. I signed and registering my protest.”

“I wrote in my objection that no document submitted by witnesses or the Wrestling Federation or recording of witness statement was shared with the members of the committee. None of the witness deposition was signed by either the witness or by the members of the committee. We did not cross-check or verify with any of the witnesses if their testimony was right or wrong. We only recorded what was said. There were individuals who had an incentive to speak in favour of one party,” the member continued.

Responding to this report, Punia told The New Indian Express, “Through your newspaper, I wanted to tell the people of this country that the statements given by the women wrestlers against the WFI chief should be made public so that they also know the truth. The whole process was videographed. These videos should be run on news channels. These statements should be made public to decide whether he (Singh) was guilty or not. I don’t know who wants to save him, who all are supporting him. We had faith in the government that it would give justice to us. However, the way things are going on, we don’t feel like the government will support us or go with the truth.”

Two upcoming events announced by the WFI have also come under the scanner, according to The Print, because they are being held in Singh’s stronghold – Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda. Both the U-17 National Championships on April 16 and Senior Open National Ranking Wrestling Tournament on April 18 are to be held at the Nandini Nagar Mahavidyalaya, a college that Singh helped found.

WFI general secretary V.N. Prasood told The Print that the events were being held because the investigation committee had submitted its report to the government.

Punia told The New Indian Express that it was unfair for the WFI to resume functioning without telling the complainants or the public the findings of the probe. “The WFI has resumed its activities even as the report of the oversight committee has not been made public yet. We don’t know whether the committee has submitted its report or not. We don’t have any information on it yet,” he said.","One of the members of the committee told Sportstar on the condition anonymity that they had objections to the way the committee’s report was drafted and so have signed it with objections.

Taking to Twitter on Sunday, February 26, Phogat sought action against the member, alleging that he has been leaking contents of the complaint of sexual harassment to the media. This, she said, not only affects the impartiality of the probe into the ongoing MeToo investigation but also amounts to an undermining of women’s dignity and safety due to the member’s “reckless” attitude.

“It has come to my recent awareness that a sportsperson member of the Oversight Committee has been allegedly leaking contents of the complaint of sexual harassment while reading certain media reports since yesterday,” Phogat wrote in a long post on Twitter, tagging Union sports minister Anurag Thakur.

The said committee was constituted by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) after wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik on January 18 accused BJP MP and WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh of sexual harassment. Several other women athletes also joined the chorus, alleging that coaches often sexually harass women athletes and spoke out about an alleged culture of impunity within WFI.

The wrestlers, who sat in an unprecedented protest at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar, had pointed to Singh’s alleged “dictatorship” in running the federation, noting that mistreatment of wrestlers had been going on for years. Among the 30 gathered at the protest were also Sarita Mor, Sangeeta Phogat, Satyawart Malik, Jitender Kinha, and Commonwealth Games medallist Sumit Malik. Following the Union government’s order, Singh stepped down as the chief of WFI.

Phogat, in her tweet on Sunday, alleged that it is a “sportsperson member” of the oversight committee who has been compromising the investigation into sexual harassment.

“It is even more appalling that this sportsperson is a member of both the committees enquiring upon the sexual harassment allegations against high-ranking office bearers of the WFI. All this has placed great mistrust towards the committee proceedings. I am feeling let down at the not just weak but also strategic attempts of this committee member towards what should have been a fair and just investigation,” her tweet said.

Seeking the removal of the said member from the committee, Phogat said, “This member has been acting against the interest of women from day one. The lack of empathy and insensitivity displayed by this sportsperson was shocking during the proceedings of the committee. I request this matter to be investigated and all necessary actions to be taken immediately.”","Taking to Twitter on Sunday, February 26, Phogat sought action against the member, alleging that he has been leaking contents of the complaint of sexual harassment to the media.

With activities of the body governing the sport – the Wrestling Federation of India – suspended over grave charges levelled by top sportspersons, the oversight committee has approved of a 55-member contingent to participate in the Zagreb Open Grand Prix.

The committee, formed in the aftermath of an unprecedented protest by the country’s most successful wrestlers, has cleared the names of 36 wrestlers (11 Greco-Roman, 12 women’s wrestling and 13 freestyle) for the tournament, the Press Trust of India has reported.

The competition, which is a series that will affect players’ world rankings, is to be held from February 1 to 5. The government usually bears the cost of sportspersons attending such tournaments.

However, The New Indian Express has reported that it is unlikely that Olympics medallists Ravi Dahiya and Bajrang Punia and Worlds medallists Vinesh Phogat and Deepak Punia – who played an important role in leading the protests against WFI chief and Bharatiya Janata Party MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh – will agree to participate, even though their names have cleared. The wrestlers had accused Singh of sexually harassing multiple sportspersons.

A day ago, Phogat, Punia and others had said that they were not consulted when the government formed the oversight committee to look into their claims.

Headed by boxing MC Mary Kom, the committee includes former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, Mission Olympic Cell member and former badminton player Trupti Murgunde, ex-CEO of Target Olympic Podium Scheme, retired Commander Rajesh Rajagopalan, and former top official at SAI, Radhica Sreeman.

One reason behind the players’ inability to join the competition is their lack of training at this point, considering the turmoil in the sport recently, TNIE reported quoting unnamed sources.

The news outlet has also reported that there are also formal issues pertaining to visa procurement as Croatia has recently become a Schengen nation, leading to certain changes in rules.","New Delhi: Top names in wrestling are unlikely to compete in a crucial Zagreb meet for which their names were approved by the Union government-appointed oversight committee, reports say.

Neither Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malilk, nor worlds medallists Vinesh Phogat and Sarita Mor were part of the process, they have alleged.

The four were part of an unprecedented protest by wrestlers in which they alleged grave wrongdoings by the WFI and especially its chief, the Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Singh has been asked to “step aside” by the Union sports ministry, which also promised the wrestlers that it would take concrete measures to inquire into their allegations.

“We were assured that we would be consulted before the setting up of the Oversight Committee. With sadness we say that our opinion was not taken at all before this committee was formed,” Vinesh Phogat tweeted in Hindi.

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/women/wrestling-sandeep-singh-sexual-harassment-bjp,,None,"In Sports or Otherwise, Failing to Act on a Complaint of Sexual Harassment Is Criminal","All the while that the nation has been applauding our sportswomen who have shown amazing talent and grit in international competitions, these remarkably talented women, it now turns out, have been silently fighting another battle – against a vicious nexus of patriarchy, power and privilege.

If there was any doubt in the minds of people with regard to the nexus it should be put to rest by the fact that both Sandeep Singh, the minster accused of sexual harassment by the athlete in Haryana, and Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the head of the Wrestling Federation of India, who faces grave allegations of similar nature are still in the saddle.

It is reported that while the former has given up charge of the concerned portfolio the other been asked to ‘step aside’ and will not participate in decision making.

While an enquiry is proceeding based on the FIR lodged by the complainant, what should be noted is that a committee headed by the additional director general of police (Rohtak Range) Mamta Singh, deputy commissioner of police at Panchkula Sumer Pratap Singh, and additional commissioner of police at Panchkula, Raj Kumar Kaushik, has been constituted to enquire based on a complaint lodged by the accused minister. However, Singh still holds charge of the department of printing and stationery. However, as chief minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar would have us believe, this will ‘not affect the probe’.

Meanwhile, the junior athletics coach – who is also a 400m national-level athlete – who lodged the complaint against Singh was transferred to Jhajjar, where she said that the necessary facilities for her sport were unavailable.

The reportage on both the Haryana incident and that relating to the Wrestling Federation speaks of the accolades those accused have won for the nation and their public stature.

This despite the fact that there have been attempts to silence the protests.

Players simply want self-respect as they prepare for big sporting events. Referring to the pressure on those seeking justice from the predatory behaviour of those in the WFI, champion wrestler Vinesh Phogat has stated, “We won’t bog down anymore and will fight for our rights.”

For sportswomen – supported by their male colleagues in the case involving the WFI – to come forward and highlight the vicious cycle of sexual harassment within the sports establishment requires tremendous courage. Such complaints threaten to disrupt the ties that have evolved between the sports bureaucracy, politicians and the corporate sector.

The complaints that have been registered need thorough investigation. That is necessary if others who may be silently suffering are to pick up the courage to speak up.

There is an urgent need to put procedures to handle such complaints in place, as per the law. These are required at all levels, be it talent search, training, selection processes, awards and the administrative sphere.

Democratisation of these bodies is urgently required to instil confidence in the players, as well as to garner fresh talent, as are transparency and accountability, specifically in handling complaints of sexual harassment, including the actions or inactions of those holding charge and responsibility for enquiry into complaints made. A person in authority who fails to act on a complaint of sexual harassment is equally guilty of violating the law. There is need to deal with incidents of sexual harassment by meting out exemplary punishment.

It is criminal to have ministers and senior people hold positions when, as per the law, they have been accused of crimes which include sections that are non-bailable.

Governments and those presiding over these bodies must be made to answer.

Finally, there is a need for greater transparency in processes of decision making. This also includes selection, training, awards and talent search across the country. It is important that eminent sportspersons come forward to initiate such processes to restore the confidence of the people, especially women, who have contributed in no small measure to achievements in this sphere.

The women’s movement in India has long argued that violence, including sexual violence – of which sexual harassment is a critical aspect – across a spectrum of socio-political institutions needs to be addressed if women are to attain equality as also equality of opportunity. Such incidents cannot be approached as a one-off, with delayed responses mired in calculations which smack of political considerations.

While campaigns such as #MeToo go a long way in enabling individual women to come out and speak, the lack of response and abdication of responsibility at the top ensures that many go scot-free. As the Supreme Court of India averred in the Vishaka Guidelines, employees and women are entitled to a workspace free of discrimination on account of sexual harassment, which creates a hostile work environment.

Equal opportunity and a level playing field are the least that women in sports in India are entitled to while we expect them to win laurels for the country, even as they perform in extremely competitive conditions under extreme pressure, having fought patriarchy and prejudice all along the way.

As for those who still choose to speak up for the rights and reputation of the accused, one is reminded of an incident in 1998 when Rupan Deol Bajaj, an officer of the Indian Administrative Service, spoke out against senior police officer K.P.S. Gill. At that time a senior editor had (in)famously opined that India as a nation ‘does not know how to honour its heroes.’ Bajaj took her fight to court, which ruled in her favour in 2005.

One can only say that contemporary India does not know how to ensure the safety of, leave alone honour, its heroines.

It said that “considering the unprecedented situation which calls for immediate measures to ameliorate the grievances of sportspersons, and to promote good governance in the WFI,” the ministry has asked the executive committee of the WFI to abstain with immediate effect from administering and managing the day-to-day activities of the Federation.

The committee is mandated to enquire into the allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment and/or intimidation, financial irregularities and administrative lapses, levelled by prominent sportspersons; undertake day-to-day administration of WFI. The Oversight Committee was asked to complete the enquiry in four weeks.

To demand a clean-up of the sports body, the country’s top wrestlers sat on a dharna at Jantar Mantar, which was termed by Singh, also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP, as “dharna of Shaheen Bagh”.

On January 18, top Indian wrestlers Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, Anshu Malik, Bajrang Punia, among others, accused the BJP MP of sexual harassment and physical abuse. Singh has denied the allegations but has reportedly agreed to step down.

However, it appears that the government has only asked him to “step aside” and not “step down” from his post.

The wrestlers decided to call off their protest on January 20, which began on January 18, saying the government and the sports minister have promised them justice.

The wrestlers have also sent a letter to P.T. Usha, head of the Indian Olympic body, seeking action against Singh.

“Vinesh Phogat was mentally harassed and tortured by the WFI chief after she missed out on an Olympic medal in Tokyo. She almost contemplated suicide,” the athletes wrote in their letter to Usha, adding that “they fear for their lives”.

A general council meeting of the WFI at Ayodhya, scheduled for today, January 22, has been cancelled.

Times of India has reported that the assistant secretary, Vinod Tomar, was let go because of his remarks defending Singh. A wrestling championship at Gonda which Tomar attended was also cancelled, it reported.

Union sports minister Anurag Thakur told TOI that Tomar had called the charges levelled against Singh “baseless.” In his post at WFI since 2002, Tomar has also been accused of embezzling scholarship funds.

On Friday night, Union sports minister Anurag Thakur announced that Singh has been asked to step aside and will be probed by an oversight committee, which will have four weeks to complete the inquiry.

Thereafter, the wrestlers decided to call off their protest, which began on Wednesday, January 18. Bajrang Punia said, “We are calling off the protest as the government and the sports minister have promised us justice.”

However, on January 21, NDTV reported him as saying: “If I make a statement, there will be a tsunami. I am not here on anyone’s charity. I am an elected representative.” Singh is a sixth-time Lok Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaisarganj constituency.

“There is no question of resigning. I have not spoken with the prime minister’s office and home minister,” he said.

The sports minister cautioned him against making any statement to media over the worry that it will exacerbate tensions.

But no official statement has been issued on Singh’s resignation as of yet.

According to news agency Press Trust of India, the agitating wrestlers reached out to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), demanding formation of an enquiry committee to probe the allegations of sexual harassment against Singh.

In a statement, the IOA said that following its executive committee meeting, it was decided to form a committee in “accordance with the prevention of sexual harassment of women act of 2013” that would hear both sides and submit its report at the earliest.

The seven-member IOA panel will include noted athletes Mary Kom, Dola Banerjee, Alaknanda Ashok, Yogeshwar Dutt and Sahdev Yadav.

Singh is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Kaiserganj in Uttar Pradesh.

The wrestlers, who have accused the WFI President of sexual exploitation and intimidation, continued their dharna for the second day at Jantar Mantar as more people joined them in what they called was a fight to give “a new life to Indian wrestling”.

On January 18, top Indian wrestlers Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, Anshu Malik, Bajrang Punia, among others, accused the BJP MP of sexual harassment and physical abuse. Singh has denied the allegations and told ANI that if such a thing has indeed happened, he will “hang” himself.

They alleged that the mistreatment of wrestlers at the federation has been going on for years, and demanded that a new federation should come into existence for the safety of sportspersons.

“Wrestlers are being harassed by the Wrestling Federation of India. Those who are a part of WFI know nothing about the sport,” Punia, who has won an Olympic Bronze, said on Wednesday.

According to PTI, three-time Commonwealth Games medallist and BJP leader Babita Phogat came to the protest site with a “message” from the government and assured the sportspersons that their demands will be met as the athletes took turn to share their bad experiences.

Twenty-one-year-old Anshu Malik narrated how the WFI president’s presence in the players’ hotel in Bulgaria during the world junior championship last year made the women wrestlers uncomfortable.

“WFI president stayed on the same floor and across the room from the junior girls at the Junior World Championships. He would leave his door open. Every girl was made uncomfortable,” she told Sportstar.

“We want the federation removed,” she added.

According to the news agency, a team of wrestlers, including Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Anshu, Sakshi Malik, and her husband Satyawrat Kadiyan, was called for a meeting with the government as they discussed their issues with sports secretary, Sujata Chaturvedi, director general of Sports Authority of India, Sandip Pradhan, and joint secretary (sports), Kunal.

During the one-hour meeting, the wrestlers were asked to end their protest and assured that their grievances will be addressed.

However, the sportspersons wanted a concrete and immediate action and decided to continue their protest unless the WFI president is removed and the national federation is disbanded along with all the state wrestling associations in the country.

Vinesh Phogat did not disclose what transpired at the meeting but said that they didn’t get a satisfactory response.

“Yesterday, we had one to two victims amongst us but now we have five to six wrestlers, who were harassed (sexually). We can’t name them now, after all they are the daughters and sisters of somebody. But if we are forced to disclose their identity, it will be a black day,” she said.

“We are World Championship and Olympic medallists, don’t suspect us, we are telling the truth, believe us,” she added.

Phogat, who has been at loggerheads with the WFI since the Tokyo Olympic Games, also claimed that several coaches at the national camp in Lucknow exploited women wrestlers, adding that there are a few women at the camp who approached the wrestlers at the behest of the WFI president.

Meanwhile, the Congress on Thursday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should break his “silence” on the allegations of sexual harassment against the BJP MP and asked why the resignations of those involved have not come in till now.

Congress’s media department head Pawan Khera said that sports minister Anurag Thakur should speak out on this matter. “The prime minister should speak out, there should be resignations, and heads should roll immediately. This should have happened long back, 24 hours is too long a time. The silence is more shocking than what has happened,” he said at a press conference at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi.

“Our players are the pride of the country. They bring laurels to the country by their performance at the world level,” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra said in a tweet in Hindi. The players have made serious allegations of exploitation against the WFI and its president and their voices should be heard, she said.

Singh is president of the Wrestling Federation of India. He has denied the allegations and told ANI that if such a thing has indeed happened, he will “hang” himself. In 2021, Singh had been caught on video slapping a wrestler at the Under-15 Nationals in Ranchi.

The wrestlers, who sat in an unprecedented protest at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar, pointed to Singh’s alleged “dictatorship” in running the federation, noting that mistreatment of wrestlers had been going on for years. Among the 30 gathered were also Sarita Mor, Sangeeta Phogat, Satyawart Malik, Jitender Kinha, and Commonwealth Games medallist Sumit Malik, according to India Today.

“Women wrestlers have been sexually harassed at national camps by coaches and also the WFI president,” Vinesh Phogat said, stressing that the WFI president is also involved in the sexual harassment of “so many girls.”

Some coaches who the federation considers “favourites” misbehave with women coaches too, Vinesh said.

“Today I have said this, I don’t know if I will be alive tomorrow. People in WFI are very powerful,” Vinesh was quoted by Indian Express as having said.

Part of Haryana’s Phogat wrestling family, Vinesh is the first Indian woman wrestler to win gold in both Commonwealth and Asian Games. She has multiple golds from the World Wrestling Championships. Vinesh’s cousin, wrestler Babita Phogat and her uncle, Mahavir Phogat, had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2020.

Vinesh reportedly said that she had been trying to get the federation to listen to her concerns for a decade now. She told ANI that she and other wrestlers are ready to “submit evidence” to the prime minister and any high court that might ask for it.

“This is not fair and we have been silently tolerating this. But not anymore,” Bajrang Punia, who has won Olympic Bronze, told Indian Express.

Punia also added that wrestlers have taken care not to involve politicians in their protest, but told the news agency PTI that while their grouse was not against a political outfit or the Sports Authority of India, this was going to be a “fight to the finish.”

“Wrestlers are being harassed by the Wrestling Federation of India. Those who are a part of WFI know nothing about the sport,” Punia told reporters as well.

Wrestler Sakshi Malik, also an Olympic medalist and related to the Phogats, said that the wrestlers are ready to “speak to the prime minister and home minister to reveal details.”

“Whole federation should be removed so that the future of new wrestlers is safe. A new federation should come into existence,” she said.

MP’s response

MP Singh has responded to the allegations by asking Vinesh Phogat why she wore “a costume with a company’s logo on it” at the Olympics.

“Is there any person in front who can say that the Federation harassed any athlete?” he asked news agency ANI. He also said that there has been “no incident of sexual harassment” and that he would hang himself if such a thing has happened.","New Delhi: Top Indian wrestlers Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik, Anshu Malik and Bajrang Punia are among a group of sportspersons who have accused Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Kaiserganj, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, of sexual harassment and physical abuse.

Singh is accused of sexually harassing several female players, including an underage girl. The country’s top wrestlers have been staging a sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi since April 23 demanding Singh’s arrest. Although the Delhi Police have registered two first information reports against Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP, he has refused to step down from the top post.

On May 5, the Haryana Amateur Wrestling Association suspended secretaries of three district units – Virender Singh Dalal of Jhajjar, Sanjay Singh Malik of Hisar and Jai Bhagwan of Mewat – with immediate effect.

The managers of Hisar district’s Shaheed Bhagat Singh Wrestling Academy – Ajay Singh Dhanda and Jai Bhagwan Lathar – were also suspended for their alleged involvement in activities against the Wrestling Federation of India and Haryana Amateur Wrestling Association.

Haryana Amateur Wrestling Association president Rohtash Singh said that the five members were suspended after they being warned in January not to participate in the agitation, reported The Hindu.

“In March, we asked them for an explanation and gave a 20-day period,” Rohtash Singh said. “We received no response, hence they have been suspended.” He also alleged that the managers “misguided” their students and took them to Jantar Mantar to protest. However, Dhanda said that he never took any of his students to the protest site.

The agitation against Singh had first started in January. However, the wrestlers had withdrawn the agitation after the Centre formed an oversight committee to look into the allegations. It was only after the protests were resumed last month and the wrestlers moved the Supreme Court that Singh was booked.

On Wednesday, a Delhi court sought a status report from the police in connection with the first information reports by May 12, PTI reported. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Harjit Singh Jaspal was hearing a petition by the protesting wrestlers seeking that the investigation be monitored and that the statements of the complainants be recorded.","The Haryana Amateur Wrestling Association suspended five officials for expressing support for the protest against Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, reported The Hindu.

Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said that the allegations against Singh were serious and the Central government should not play politics in the case.

Write to me at theindiafix@scroll.in.

In January, some of India’s top wrestlers began a street protest in the capital, New Delhi, demanding that Brij Bhushan Singh, president of Wrestling Federation of India, be arrested on charges of sexual harassment.

The protesting wrestlers included some of the top names in the sport, including men and women who have won medals for India in the Olympics. On the other side was Singh, a powerful member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh belonging to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

In response, the Modi government used a tried and tested tactic to quell agitations: it appointed a committee. Frustrated with this delaying tactic, the wrestlers restarted their agitation in April. This had more success than the January agitation. On April 28, after the case had been heard in the Supreme Court, the Delhi Police relented and filed first information reports against the BJP MP. One of them was under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act given that Singh was accused of sexually harassing a minor.

Backing Singh

In spite of the severity of the allegations as well as the fact that the people making them were some of the most prominent Indian sportspeople alive today, the BJP has stuck by Singh. The Delhi Police, controlled by the Modi government, filed an FIR only after pressure from the Supreme Court. However, even then, it has not arrested Singh. In fact, Singh has released statements brazenly saying that he will not resign as president of the Wrestling Federation of India.

How is the BJP managing to resist the political pressures that such a grave incident could potentially put on the party?

Part of the answer lies in the unfortunate fact that women’s safety plays out in complex ways when it comes to voting. In spite of the fact that women make up half the electorate, by itself it is rare for women’s safety to feature as a major issue during elections. Instead, communitarian identity – caste and religion – usually dominate Indian elections along with economic factors such as inflation and welfare.

This cold political calculus probably explains why the BJP thinks that it might gain more by backing Singh than by supporting the sportspeople who allege they have been harassed. The wrestling chief started out life as a so-called bahubali or gangster and has been accused of working with terrorist Dawood Ibrahim. Later he built an impressive political network in Uttar Pradesh, with strong backing from his Rajput community.

Lack of impact

The fact of community identity trumping gender violence is true not only for the 2023 wrestler’s protest: it has been a longtime feature of Indian politics. The 2002 Gujarat riots, for example, saw mass sexual violence against women. However, this played out electorally along the lines of communal identity. The violence ensured a Hindu vote bank for the BJP, catapulting Modi to the status of a national figure. As part of this politics, the BJP-led Gujarat government last year released some criminals convicted of gangrape during the riots and the party felicitated them after they walked out of jail.

As if to illustrate this political phenomenon, on Sunday, in fact, one of the protesting wrestlers shared a message in support of the BJP’s Hindutva push in the Karnataka elections.

So strong is this communitarian superstructure in Indian politics that even the wrestler’s protest has used it. Khap panchayats of the powerful Jat caste from Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh have backed the wrestlers, ensuring that the protests continue even in the face of strong pressure from the Delhi Police.

Apart from straight electoral calculation, the BJP is also helped by the fact that much of the Hindi- and English-language mass media in the country does not report critically on the Modi government. Part of this has to do with the government’s ability to use the legal framework to reign in recalcitrant media houses. In other cases, owners of media companies are friendly with the government. It is also a fact that members of the upper castes, who dominate the national media, tend to be strong supporters of the BJP.

The UPA exception

This stands in stark contrast to the second term of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, where the issue of women’s safety actually did acquire the political prominence it deserves. The Manmohan Singh-led government was strongly attacked by the media in the wake of the horrific 2012 Delhi gangrape and murder. In contrast, in 2020, a gangrape in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh saw much more limited media outrage in spite of the fact that the BJP-led government actually moved to quell protests using draconian force by summarily burning the body of the victim.

In 2012, Delhi had seen large protests for women’s safety. In 2020, the Delhi Police used force to make sure no protests happen given that even a limited protest in the capital would generate TV images that could be beamed across the country and undermine the BJP’s political capital.

With strong media control and support from powerful upper castes, the BJP has ensured that the media is unable to repeat the strong watchdog role it played during the Congress years when it comes to women’s safety.

While media control is a strong factor that helps the BJP government control the political narrative, it is not impossible to overcome. In fact, sustained protests seem to be the one thing that can break it. Farmer protesters have successfully rolled back the farm laws while protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act seem to have led to the law being frozen. As a result, while Modi’s BJP has successfully prevented women’s safety from being an issue that could erode its political capital, a sustained protest by the wrestlers against allegations of sexual harassment by a BJP MP could, in theory, change that.","In fact, Singh has released statements brazenly saying that he will not resign as president of the Wrestling Federation of India.

Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh, has denied the allegations and refused to step down from his post in the wrestling body.

On April 28, the Delhi Police had filed two first information reports against him, roughly four months after the wrestlers first went public with the charges.

Khap president (Palam) Chaudhary Surender Solanki said that protests will continue till the wrestlers get justice. “How we take it [the protest] forward, will be decided by all of us today,” he said.

“We have put more cameras and CCTVs on the ground,” an unidentified police officer said. “The officers will also be armed with cameras…We have also made adequate traffic arrangements to help commuters and other protesters who are coming from Punjab and Haryana.”

Meanwhile, Singh again refuted the allegation against him.

In that time she has won several medals in championships organised by the Haryana Wrestling Association. She also participated in last year’s Khelo India Youth Games. Now, though, she is no longer sure about staying in wrestling.

Reason: the protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar by the country’s top wrestlers against Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and what it has revealed about the state of professional wrestling in India. The wrestlers, who include star names such as Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat, are seeking the removal and arrest of Singh, a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh, whom they accuse of serial sexual harassment of female athletes. At their insistence and the intervention of the Supreme Court, Singh was booked by the Delhi Police on April 28, but has escaped further action thus far.

“Those who have made India proud time and again are facing such grave injustices. If they can be brought to tears, who will listen to us if anything untoward were to happen?” Kajal said during a break from training at an akhada in Rohtak’s Khidwali village where she has been practising since she was 12. She was referring to Phogat and Malik, who broke down on camera during a recent press conference at the protest site. “We may even have to quit wrestling if the situation remains the same.”

Kajal’s friend and fellow wrestler Simran, 18, echoed her. “We will switch to kabaddi or boxing. We are not sure at this moment,” she said. “What we are sure of is that we cannot continue being wrestlers if he remains in his position.”

She meant Singh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by at least seven female wrestlers, one of whom is a minor. Although the Wrestling Federation chief has been booked for outraging the modesty of a woman and under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, his alleged conduct has distressed many budding female wrestlers and their parents in Haryana. Scroll met and spoke with at least 15 such wrestlers and their parents in Titoli, Khidwali and Sunderpur villages in Rohtak, Chhara in Jhajjar, and Gohana in Sonipat. The three districts have been called the “wrestling belt of India” by former wrestler Satpal Singh, and have produced such athletes as Sonam Malik, Pinki Malik, Sakshi Malik, and Reetika Hooda.

“Trainees in my akhada are inspired by such personalities and, like them, they want to be known nationwide for their talents,” said Joginder, 40, who runs the only akhada for female wrestlers in Khidwali. “But now, there is additional vigilance by parents. They accompany their children even to practice sessions every morning and evening. This started only after chatter about the allegations against Brij Bhushan started circulating among pehelwans.”

Joginder’s akhada also trains girls from neighbouring Titoli and Sanghi villages. But he has lately noticed a decline in youngsters or their parents approaching him to be admitted.

Nearly 28 km away in Gohana, trainer Ajmer Malik, 53, echoed these concerns. After the allegations against Singh emerged, he said, parents have been reluctant to leave their girls out of sight even inside the akhada. Ajmer started his Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Academy over a decade ago and has coached Sonam Malik, who won a silver medal at the 2022 World Junior Wrestling Championships held in Bulgaria.

“Parents look with suspicion even at me and I understand why. The stories of Brij Bhushan’s conduct towards female wrestlers have evoked a sense of fear among them,” he said. “I only wish the best for my students and hope that more girls from my academy reach the world stage.”

For the parents, although having a medallist in the family would be a pride achievement, their sense of assurance has been shaken by the allegations of sexual misconduct against the head of the national sports body that would exercise considerable control over their careers.

Virender Dalal, 55, who runs the only akhada for girls in Chhara village and has trainees from as far as Rajasthan, said he never lets them go alone to any wrestling camps. “The local camps are daylong and I ensure that I accompany them, along with a few other pehelwans from our village. But parents can’t stay with their children when it comes to national camps run by the WFI,” said Dalal, who also trains his two daughters. “Everybody has now become afraid of that. We don’t know what will happen but I am not letting them be there alone, ever.”

This hesitation is swiftly shrinking the opportunities available to young female wrestlers, according to Dalal’s daughter Swati, who recently won a gold medal in an inter-university championship. “Being in those camps is important for national events,” she said.

Moreover, escorting pupils to camps and tournaments is expensive. In Titoli, Antim, 17, who has a box full of gold and silver medals, said her uncle, a farmer, goes with her everywhere now, from the morning practice to tournaments like Khelo India. Some of the trips have ended up costing him Rs 35,000.

But he doesn’t see any other option. “She is very talented and it is our duty to encourage her. All our hopes are pinned on her,” the uncle said. “But if we do not go with her, who will be responsible for her safety?”

Girls who come from families that cannot afford to travel with them are slowly dropping out of practice, according to Joginder. At least two girls from Titoli have stopped coming to his akhada because their parents were not in a position to accompany them every day.

Nisha, 17, a pupil of Joginder, said some of her peers, including one friend of hers, are being told to leave wrestling for good. “There were girls here who came from families where every member was working to sustain themselves. This sport is expensive as it is and revelations about Brij Bhushan’s actions have only made it all worse,” she said.

It would help ease the prevailing anxiety, she said, if Singh were removed from the Wrestling Federation. “If we succeed in the sport and go further, we may have to face the same harassment,” she explained. “This is why we feel it would be better if he quits WFI.”

On May 1, Nisha, along with her friends from the akhada, participated in a rally organised in her village by the Hooda Khap to seek Singh’s removal. They burnt his effigies and shouted slogans. They also threatened to march to Delhi, like the farmers had two years ago, if the protesting wrestlers’ demands weren’t met.

On May 4, all of Joginder’s pupils, along with their parents, reached Jantar Mantar to lend their support to the protest, barely a few hours after a late night scuffle between the wrestlers and the police. “They are our seniors. They are doing this for us, so that we don’t have to face what they did,” said Kajal, who sat in solidarity with her seniors at the protest site after missing a day’s practice. “Of course, we will support them with all our might.”

Most of the young wrestlers and their trainers that we spoke with for this story were reluctant to be identified by their full names for fear of reprisals.","She was referring to Phogat and Malik, who broke down on camera during a recent press conference at the protest site.

The wrestlers, in their petition, had sought a first information report against Wrestling Federation Of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who they have accused of sexually harassing several female players.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court closed the proceedings after noting that two FIRs have now been filed against Singh. The court also noted that seven complainants have been provided adequate security.

A bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha allowed the petitioners to move the jurisdictional magistrate or the Delhi High Court if they felt that further directions were needed, according to The Indian Express. The court, however, did not entertain a plea to appoint a retired judge to monitor the investigation.

Commonwealth Games gold medal winner Vinesh Phogat, one of the protesting wrestlers, said that the petitioners will abide by the court’s order.

“Whatever the Supreme Court has done, we will be indebted to them from the bottom of our heart, because for six days the police didn’t even register an FIR,” she said. “When the Supreme Court ordered, only then the FIR was registered.”

Phogat said that the wrestlers have several options open in case their demands are not met.

“We knew what was in the hands of the Supreme Court,” she said, according to PTI. “Everyone’s hands are tied, because our country is governed by the Constitution and not by protests. Protests cannot force them to change Constitution.”

The athletes have been staging a sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar since April 23 , demanding Singh’s arrest.

Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh, has denied the allegations and refused to step down from his post in the wrestling body.

The Delhi Police last week filed two FIRs against him, roughly four months after the wrestlers first went public with the charges.

On Wednesday night, the wrestlers alleged that they were manhandled and abused by the police while they were trying to bring folding beds to the protest site. Former wrestler Rajveer alleged that one policeman, who was drunk, abused Phogat and got involved in a scuffle with others.

The athletes have been staging a sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar since April 23. They are demanding the arrest of Wrestling Federation Of India chief Brij Bhushan Singh, alleging he has sexually harassed several female players.

Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh, has denied the allegations and refused to step down from his post in the wrestling body.

The Delhi Police last week filed two first information reports against him, roughly four months after the wrestlers first went public with the charges.

On Wednesday, Phogat said that the protesting wrestlers are not criminals and do not deserve such treatment.

“The cop jumped in and stopped us – didn’t wait for a woman cop and just started pushing us,” Phogat said at an impromptu post-midnight press conference. “Some of us were hit on the head with a stick. Did we win medals for the nation to see such days...Where were the women cops when the constable was pushing us around?”

Following the chaos, Punia and Phogat said that they are ready to return all the medals that they have won to the government, reported PTI.

“Take it all away,” Phogat said, “We have been humiliated so much. We are fighting for our respect but we are being crushing under their feet. Do all men have the right to abuse women?”

Punia also exhorted farmers and members of the public to reach Jantar Mantar to support the protestors, reported PTI. “This is the time,” he said. “If not, then when? This is a question of the dignity of our daughters. People like Brij Bhushan are roaming freely despite being criminals and all this is happening to us.”

Soon after Punia’s call to protest, the Delhi Police instructed heads of all districts in the national capital, especially those deployed in the border areas, to be on alert, reported ANI.

The directions were issued after the police allegedly received inputs that a large number of people can reach Jantar Mantar, an unidentified police official told the news agency.

“They have also been asked to take special care and keep watch on roads which go towards Central Delhi,” an unidentified police official told PTI. “Barricades have been put up at several locations across Delhi as part of precautionary measures to ensure no untoward incident takes place.”

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Delhi) Pranav Tayal claimed that the late-night incident took place after Aam Aadmi Party MLA Somnath Bharti arrived at the site without permission and carrying foldable beds.

“On being asked about the beds, his supporters became aggressive and tried to get the beds from a truck,” Tayal said. “Subsequently, a minor altercation took place following which Bharti, along with two others, was detained.”

Congress leader Deepender Hooda and chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal were also among those detained. “I am concerned for their safety,” Maliwal said on Thursday morning. “Why is Delhi Police protecting Brij Bhushan Singh? Why is Delhi Police not arresting him?”

The protesting wrestlers also told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the Delhi Police have not taken any action after filing two cases against Singh.

“The police is yet to record our statement under Section 161 of Code of Criminal Procedure,” their counsel told a bench a comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha.

The judges accepted the wrestlers request to place additional material in a sealed cover ahead of a hearing on Thursday.

That was what Vinesh Phogat said in a tweet on April 24. “From the podium to the footpath,” said the wrestler with several medals at the World Championships, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games. “In the hope of justice under the open sky at midnight.”

Since April 23, several champion Indian wrestlers have descended from the podiums and the mats to stage a sit-in on the streets of Jantar Mantar in the heart of New Delhi in an attempt to seek a fair hearing. Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia are the face of a protest demanding that Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh be removed as president of the Wrestling Federation of India for allegedly sexually abusing several wrestlers. They also want him arrested.

Update: Wrestlers protesting at Jantar Mantar allege they were manhandled by Delhi Police

The wrestlers say they hope to end the culture of unchecked power and subservience that engulfs the Wrestling Federation of India. Adding to the impression of such imperiousness is the fact that Singh is a Bharatiya Janata Party MP.

This is the second time in five months that the wrestlers have taken to the street. They staged their first protest in January but dispersed after Sports Minister Anurag Thakur promised an investigation into the allegations.

From the first time they hit the streets to the current protests, there has been a great deal of discussion about the wrestlers and their battle against Singh. What are their motives? Why now? Who is making them do it? But though all the noise, one thread stands: these wrestling stars decided to risk it all by taking this position. Serious headway is yet to be made, although finally Delhi Police registered First Information Reports.

Could this entire saga have been avoided in an ideal world? And what can India’s sports federations do to ensure things don’t come to this again?

Grievance redressal

Observers say there are many lessons to be drawn from this controversy. To begin with, what many have failed to recognise is that sports is a non-traditional livelihood. For many Indians, there is a simple motive for pursuing sport, one that goes beyond acquiring national and individual glory: it is a means to make ends meet and provides employment. This means that for athletes, arenas and training camps are a workplace.

That makes the absence of a framework like the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, in Indian sports a major lapse.

“Every case of sexual harassment that happens in institutional space is down to the kind of power dynamic that exists,” said Shadab Bano, a professor at the Centre of Advanced Study in History, Aligarh Muslim University, and Joint Secretary of the Indian Association of Women’s Studies. “And for that matter, all these institutions are expected to have an Internal Complaints Committee and it’s very strange that a committee was not in place when sexual harassment is so rampant.”

Another important point raised by this episode is the need to address the failure of the system and why the athletes thought that a public protest was their only resort, said Deepthi Bopaiah, Chief Executive Officer of GoSports Foundation.

“We should be able to have a dialogue and close it, and at least, make them feel like they’re being heard,” Bopaiah said.

She added: “In the sporting world, in one of the most developed countries in the world, in a sport like gymnastics... something like that had been happening for years despite multiple complaints. More than 360 kids were getting abused by Larry Nassar. We don’t need to wait for something like that to happen, right? This should actually urge us to create something and put in a process.”

Nassar, the team doctor for the United States of America’s gymnastics team, was named in hundreds of complaints filed by athletes who claimed he engaged in sexual abuse for at least 14 years while purporting to provide medical treatment. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

On paper, the Wrestling Federation does have a Sexual Harassment Committee. According to the wrestling federation’s website, that is the official name of the organisation’s Ethics Commission, which also deals with issues like doping, age fraud and match fixing.

However, according to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, an organisation’s Internal Complaints Committee needs to be headed by a woman and more than half of the members on the panel need to be women. That is not the case here.

The panel has four men and one woman. But the only woman on the committee, 2016 Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik, is among those at the Jantar Mantar protest. The committee also lacks an external member who would be specifically equipped to deal with challenges like these without a bias.

The federation’s website also mentions a Grievance Redressal Committee. But it is headed by Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the very person against whom the grievance is directed.

While it is vital to look at sports through the prism of employment and livelihood, the unique characteristics of the discipline must also be kept in mind. Athletes are required to stay away from home for long periods, travel with others frequently and need the constant guidance of their coaches. As a consequence, professional relationships with fellow athletes, coaches and support staff often become friendships.

Dealing with abuse requires a sensitised redressal system within a framework like the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, backed by something like the Vishaka Guidelines. The Vishaka Guidelines are a set of procedural directions issued by the Supreme Court of India in 1997 for use in sexual harassment cases in the workplace.

Aparajita Bharti, Founding Partner at The Quantum Hub Consulting, a public policy research firm, said that it is essential for sportspeople to feel a sense of security. “Safety is a huge determinant of whether women participate in the workforce, whether they feel safe in travel, whether they feel safe at their workplace”. The same standard should apply for sports, she said, because it is a profession.

“We are now building an ecosystem where we are excelling at sports,” said Bharti. “It is something that we aspire for as a country. If the narrative that women are not safe in sports gets built, it can actually have an impact on women participating in sports going further, which would eventually be bad for the country too.”

#WrestlerProtests

Reforms are essential

The protest also points out an administrative failure by India’s sporting federations. Following the first demonstrations by the wrestlers in January, the Sports Ministry and the Indian Olympic Association set up committees to investigate the allegations and manage the functioning of the wrestling federation.

However, the oversight committee appointed by the Sports Ministry reportedly could not come to any conclusion about the allegations against Singh. The fact that this information was leaked to the media by unidentified sources and has not been made public has angered the wrestlers particularly.

During the second round of protests, the Indian Olympic Association set up an ad-hoc committee to manage the wrestling federation until a new body is elected. However, the wrestlers felt let down by the comments of Indian Olympic Association chief PT Usha on April 27 at which she claimed that the public protest was a sign of indiscipline.

IOA chief PT Usha: ‘Wrestlers going to streets to protest is not good for sport, shows indiscipline’

Said Phogat: “If we are sitting out in the streets, there must be some reason, a reason that nobody listened to us, be it IOA or Sports Ministry. Her saying this is insensitive. I even called her, but she did not pick up my phone.”

Bopaiah said that the wrestlers have probably taken to the streets because they do not feel they have been heard. “I think having the empathy and the ability to speak, console, care and giving them some confidence that ‘we don’t have the outcome yet but we are with you,’ was the need of the hour,” she said.

She added: “Empathy is so important. Maybe you don’t have a solution but are you there, are you making them feel seen and heard? Are you sharing that you are going to do everything in your capacity to get them to the right person?”

Another theme that is often discussed when reports of sexual harassment surface is the role of women in creating safe spaces. Still, while it is vital for women to occupy leadership roles, this does not necessarily ensure swift or just action in such situations.

Bharti said that while spaces do not automatically become safer by having women at the helm, they become safer when more women are present. “Women also sometimes have a lot of internalised patriarchy,” she said. “They also need to be trained about rights.”

The escalation of the protest by wrestlers has directed attention towards the need to institute mechanisms to safeguard the rights of athletes. As is evident in this protest, powerful politicians continue to be associated with sporting bodies and standing up against them is doubly hard.

Bopaiah said that the administrators must publicly announce those frameworks so that all stakeholders know that they are protected. If something happens, they will know what steps to take

“Sometimes policies and processes exist on paper but neither the communication around it, nor the training for it is happening,” she said.

‘All resistance is political’

In January, the protesting wrestlers declared that they did not want any political support for their demands, despite Singh’s own background in politics.

This time around, Jantar Mantar is being frequented by current and former chief ministers, members of the Opposition party and other active politicians. The wrestlers are more than willing to accept support from all sides. Unsurprisingly after the renewed protests, Singh hit out saying that they are politically motivated.

Why did the wrestlers modify their position? Bano has a simple explanation.

“Every resistance is political...even if the individual is not very conscious of this,” she said.

In a long-drawn protest, she said, participants consider various strategies that could possibly resolve their problem. “They might have felt that involving politicians at that stage might distract them or might disturb their protests,” she said. “They might have also assessed how the protests are being received...It is natural that upon realising that the resolution of such a serious matter is taking a long time, they are wanting to adopt different ways of reaching out. ”

What does it say of the country when it takes so much for hard-working athletes to be heard? One thing is clear: Indian sports administration is in dire need of reform.","They staged their first protest in January but dispersed after Sports Minister Anurag Thakur promised an investigation into the allegations.

Last week, Usha had stoked a controversy when she said that the wrestlers’ protest on the street showed they were indisciplined.

Since April 23, several wrestlers, including Olympic and Commonwealth Games medalists, have been staging a sit-in protest demanding Singh’s resignation and legal action against him for allegedly sexually harassing several sportswomen. The Delhi Police have filed two first information reports against Singh, but he has refused to step down from his post in the wrestling body.

On Wednesday afternoon, Usha told the wrestlers that she was an athlete first and then an administrator, Olympic medalist Bajrang Punia said, according to PTI.

“Initially when she said that [Usha’s previous comments], we felt very bad but then she said that her comments were misinterpreted,” Punia said. “We told her that we want justice. We don’t have a fight with the government or opposition or anyone else. We are sitting here for the betterment of wrestling.”

However, when asked if Usha had offered a solution to the matter from the government, Punia said: “Nothing of that sort... she only said that she is with us.”

Usha herself refused to speak to reporters, according to PTI. A video on social media showed her walking away from protestors after one of them confronted her and accused her of insulting women.

Usha and Indian Olympic Association Joint Secretary Kalyan Chaubey last Thursday had said that an ad-hoc committee has been formed to govern the Wrestling Federation of India so that the day-to-day activities of the sport are not affected. She insisted then that the protesting wrestlers should have addressed their concerns to the association before taking to the streets.

“Thoda toh discipline hona chahiye (there should be some discipline). They should come to us earlier. Instead of coming to us they have gone straight to the streets. It’s not at all good for sport,” the former sprinter said.

Then they were asked if the wrestlers are setting a wrong precedent by engaging in these protests for which Usha insisted they had to come to the Indian Olympic Association first.

Chaubey then added, “What Dr. PT Usha would like to say again and again is that this kind of agitation is not good for the country’s image. India is the fifth largest economy in the world and has a good reputation globally. This negative publicity is not good for the country.”

Usha then is heard saying, “Yes, it’s not good for the country.”

#WATCH | Indian Olympic Association president PT Usha reached Delhi's Jantar Mantar where wrestlers are protesting since 11 days. pic.twitter.com/Vs3Lp1ZHaO — ANI (@ANI) May 3, 2023

Punia reiterated that the wrestlers will continue to protest till Singh in put in jail, and said that Usha should fulfill her promise to support them.

“We clarified to her that until and unless...we get justice, of which we are very hopeful, this protest will continue,” the wrestler said. “...She said she will try to resolve all our problems. If she wants she can do anything.”

The protests by the wrestlers first started on January 18 at the same venue of Jantar Mantar in Delhi. The wrestlers had called off the agitation after talks with Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.

“Resignation is not a big deal but I am not a criminal,” Singh said. “If I resign, it will mean that I have accepted their [wrestlers] allegations. My tenure [as WFI president] is almost over. Government has formed a three-member committee and elections will be held in 45 days and my term will end after the elections.”

Since April 23, Olympic medal winners Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia and Commonwealth Games gold medal winner Vinesh Phogat are among several athletes who have been protesting at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar seeking action against Singh.

The Delhi Police filed two first information reports against the federation chief on Friday, roughly four months after the wrestlers first went public with the charges and hours after the Supreme Court heard the case. However, the athletes have said that they would continue their agitation until he was arrested.

Singh, a six-time Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj, told reporters on Saturday that he is ready to cooperate with the investigating agencies but everyday the wrestlers are coming up with new demands.

“Now they are saying that I should be sent to jail and resign from all posts,” he said. “I am MP because of people of my constituency and not because of Vinesh Phogat.”

He also claimed that the protesting wrestlers belong to one particular group while 90% players of Haryana support him.

The politician also alleged that some industrialists and the Congress party are involved in the protest against him. “[Congress general secretary] Priyanka Gandhi Vadra does not know facts, when the investigating committee will release its report then she will come to know,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Vadra met the protesting wrestlers at Jantar Mantar and expressed solidarity.

“These are serious allegations and he should first resign,” Vadra told reporters later. “As long as he is still at the post he will continue to tarnish the careers of these players. What is the point of investigation if he is still at the most powerful position in the federation?”

She also said that the Delhi Police should show them a copy of the FIRs registered against Singh.

One of the FIRs against Singh pertains to allegations made by a minor player and was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act along with relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code concerning outraging modesty. The second FIR was filed in connection to allegations made by adult complainants.

On Friday, Vinesh Phogat said at a press conference that the wrestlers have lost faith in the Delhi Police as it took them six days and the intervention of the Supreme Court to take action.

A bench of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice PS Narasimha was hearing a petition by the country’s top wrestlers seeking registration of a case against the chief of the sport’s governing body.

Deputy Commissioner of Police, New Delhi, Pranav Tayal said later the first FIR pertained to allegations made by a minor player and was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act along with relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code concerning outraging modesty.

The second FIR was filed in connection to allegations made by the adult complainants.

On April 23, several athletes, including Olympic bronze medal winners Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia and Commonwealth Games gold medal winner Vinesh Phogat, resumed their sit-in protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar seeking action against Singh.

Seven women wrestlers, including the minor, filed a sexual harassment complaint against him in Delhi on April 21.

The wrestlers had first hit the streets in January but withdrew the protest after the government asked Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj, to step aside for a few weeks and formed an oversight committee to look into the allegations.

At Friday’s hearing, the chief justice directed the Delhi Police to ensure the safety of the minor girl, Bar and Bench reported. Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal submitted in a sealed cover that there were concerns about her security.

“An affidavit shall be filed [by the Delhi Police] regarding the steps taken to provide security to the minor girl,” Justice Chandrachud said while posting the case next week for further hearing.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court said that the allegations in the petition by the wrestlers were “serious”. A day later, the Delhi Police told the court that a preliminary investigation is necessary before the authorities file the case.

Ahead of Friday’s hearing in the Supreme Court, Sangeeta Phogat, national-ranked wrestler and Punia’s wife, asserted that the athletes will stay put at the site until Singh is punished, ANI reported.

“We didn’t get justice earlier,” she added. “The girls have blamed him for sexual harassment so an FIR should be registered and he should get punished according to the acts. As you can see nobody came to us, we didn’t receive a phone call, [and] nobody has told us that we will get justice.”

Pained by silence of top sportspersons: Vinesh Phogat

Vinesh Phogat, meanwhile, objected to Indian Olympic Association President PT Usha’s comments saying the sportspersons protesting on the streets were tarnishing the image of the country. The Indian Olymic Association president had said that their action amounts to indiscipline.

Vinesh Phogat told reporters that Usha’s comments were insensitive. “We live as per the constitution and are independent citizens,” she added. “We can go anywhere. If we are sitting out in the streets, there must be some reason, a reason that nobody listened to us.”

She also told The Indian Express that she was pained by the silence of Indian cricketers as well as other top sportspersons.

“The entire country worships cricket but not even a single cricketer has spoken up,” she said. “We aren’t saying that you speak in our favour, but at least put up a neutral message and say there should be justice for whichever party.”

She pointed out that Indian cricketers had supported the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States in 2020, when people took to the streets against police brutality.

“Don’t we deserve even that much?” the wrestler asked. “I understand that they may be concerned that this could affect their sponsorship and brand endorsement deals. Maybe that’s why they are afraid to associate themselves with athletes who are protesting.”

After her comments, Olympic gold medallist Neeraj Chopra voiced his support for the athletes. This was followed by tennis icon Sania Mirza, among other sportspersons, calling for justice.

WFI chief says won’t go down without fight

Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has denied the allegations against him, in a video message on Thursday said he will fight with all his might to prove his innocence.

“Friends, the day I reflect on my life, what I gained or lost, the day I feel I don’t have the strength to fight, the day I feel helpless, I won’t like to live a life like that,” the wrestling body chief said. “Instead of living such a life, I would wish that death embraces me.”

Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur, who had formed the oversight committee to look into the charges, said the government stands with the protesting wrestlers and he himself spoke to them for 12 hours.

But Punia dismissed his claims. “Once ask the sports minister for how long you were sitting among the players,” he told reporters. “He sat for 2-4 minutes with the players. His officials were mediating with the players.”","Earlier in the day, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court that an FIR will be registered by evening.

Subsequently, seven female wrestlers have lodged complaints against the WFI president. However, the Delhi Police is yet to reportedly file an FIR.

On April 23, several athletes, including Olympic bronze medal winners Punia and Sakshi Malik and Commonwealth Games gold medal winner Vinesh Phogat, resumed their sit-in protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar seeking action against Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Singh.

At a press conference on Thursday, Thakur had claimed that the government gave chances to all the protesting wrestlers to present their case before an oversight committee and reiterated its commitment to an “impartial probe” into the charges against Singh.

“I have spent 12 hours with them – seven hours on the first day and five hours the next day [in January],” claimed Thakur. “I had listened to all their grievances, held a press conference at 2-2.30 at night, formed a committee after talking to them.”

The athletes had leveled the allegations against Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj, first on January 18 during a protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar.

Hours after Thakur’s press conference, Punia refuted Thakur’s claims. “Once ask the sports minister for how long you were sitting among the players,” he claimed. “He sat for 2-4 minutes with the players. His officials were mediating with the players.”

Phogat also echoed Punia’s allegations and said the sports minister didn’t even spend 12 minutes with the sportspersons. Phogat also alleged that the wrestlers were at times even intimidated during the meetings held to resolve the issue.

On January 23, after the protests first began, the sports ministry had formed a oversight committee, headed by boxing legend MC Mary Kom, to investigate the allegations by the wrestlers.

The committee was given a one-month deadline. But the panel submitted its report in the first week of April and its findings have not been made public so far, according to PTI. Singh had appeared before the Indian Olympic Association and the government’s oversight committee in connection with the case.

Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, and Sakshi Malik are the three prominent figures in the fresh protests against Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused by the grapplers of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation.

“Our feeling is that for sexual harassment complaints, IOA has an athletes’ commission. Instead of going to the street (again), they could have come to us earlier itself, but they have not at all come to IOA,” Usha told reporters after IOA’s Executive Committee meeting, reported PTI.

Usha and IOA Joint Secretary Kalyan Chaubey said that an ad-hoc committee has now been formed so that the day-to-day activities of the sport is not affected.

The President insisted that the protesting wrestlers should have addressed their concerns to the IOA before taking to the streets.

“Thoda toh discipline hona chahiye (there should be some discipline). They should come to us earlier. Instead of coming to us they have gone straight to the streets. It’s not at all good for sport,” the former sprinter said.

Then they were asked if the wrestlers are setting a wrong precedent by engaging in these protests for which Usha insisted they had to come to the IOA first.

Chaubey then added, “What Dr. PT Usha would like to say again and again is that this kind of agitation is not good for the country’s image. India is the fifth largest economy in the world and has a good reputation globally. This negative publicity is not good for the country.”

Usha then is heard saying, “Yes, it’s not good for the country.”

However, one primary reason for why the protests were renewed last week is, in fact, because they were dissatisfied with the progress that has been made by the committees that have been formed.

On Thursday, after the Sports Ministry’s directions, the IOA established a three-member ad hoc council to oversee the activities of the WFI until a new body is elected. The committee will be led by a yet-to-be-named retired high court judge including former shooter Suma Shirur and Wushu Association of India chief Bhupendra Singh Bajwa.

“It is important that sports is not affected and the day to day administration is not affected,” said Usha.

The protests by the wrestlers had first started on January 18 at the same venue. They, however, ended after marathon talks with Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.

Responding to the remarks made by Usha, Sakshi Malik told reporters: “Being a woman athlete, she (PT Usha) isn’t listening to other women athletes. Where’s indiscipline here, we are sitting here peacefully.”

Bajrang Punia said later that we went to the IOA three months back while Vinesh Phogat said that they have returned the streets only because no one else heard them, saying Usha hadn’t answered her call.

On Wednesday, former Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra tweeted about the matter, saying he was deeply concerned that the wrestlers had to resort to protesting on the streets.

“As athletes, we train hard every day to represent our country on the international stage.

In the days leading upto WFI’s election, IOA will also appoint a retired High Court Judge to the Ad-Hoc Committee. The WFI Ad-Hoc committee will be responsible to manage the affairs of the federation including selection and participation of sportspersons in international events.

WFI’s earlier proposed May 7, 2023, election now stands null and void, as per the directive given by Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports. New date for the election will be communicated by Ad-Hoc Committee.

In the IOA press release, Usha expressed her disappointment over the protesting wrestlers’ attempt to give this a political color. She said, “Those protesting are renowned wrestlers who brought laurels to the country. They have an equal responsibility of safeguarding the interest of our sports and sportspersons and also the image of our country. However, they are sitting on dharna, asking all political parties to join them etc, is what disappoints me.”

“IOA had constituted a committee chaired by renowned female athlete Ms. Mary Kom, in January 2023 on receipt of the complaint. The committee held various hearings of both the parties.

“He invites us to his home when we win medals and gives us a lot of respect and calls us his daughters. Today, we appeal to him that he listens to our ‘mann ki baat’.”

Top Indian wrestlers protesting at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar to support their demand for action against Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexual harassment, held their morning exercise and training session at the protest site on Wednesday.

After their earlier protest this year didn’t result in any action, the wrestlers resumed their sit-in on Sunday, April 23. They declared they would not leave the protest site until action is taken against Singh, who is also a BJP MP.

A bench headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud said that the allegations against Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh were “serious” and issued a notice to the Delhi Police in the case.

“The matter requires consideration by this court,” the chief justice said.

The development came two days after several athletes, including Olympic bronze medal winners Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia and Commonwealth Games gold medal winner Vinesh Phogat, resumed their sit-in protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar seeking action against Singh.

At Wednesday’s hearing, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told the court that seven women wrestlers, including a minor, have filed a sexual harassment complaint against Singh in Delhi but the police have not filed a first information report.

“Please see the last complaint by the minor…the young girl had won a gold medal,” he told the chief justice.

Sibal said that the police officers can be prosecuted for failing to register the FIR in an offence of this nature.

“The plea is taken on board,” the bench said, according to PTI. “The identity of the petitioners shall be redacted. Only the redacted petition shall be made available in the public domain.”

The country’s top wrestlers had first levelled the allegations against Singh, who is the Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj, on January 18 during a protest at the same site. They, however, ended the demonstration after marathon talks with Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.

On January 23, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports formed an oversight panel, headed by boxer MC Mary Kom, to investigate the matter. The committee submitted its report in the first week of April but its findings have not been made public yet.

On Monday, the sports ministry said the report was “under examination” but flagged some “major findings” after a preliminary scrutiny of it.

It said that the Wrestling Federation of India had no Internal Complaints Committee, which is necessary under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act to deal with allegations of sexual harassment within an organisation.

The ministry also highlighted a lack of awareness-building measures among sportspersons for their grievance redressal and recommended more transparency and consultation between the wrestling federation and the athletes.

It, however, did not comment on the sexual misconduct charges against Singh.","“The matter requires consideration by this court,” the chief justice said.

The chief of the sport’s governing federation, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, is accused of sexually harassing women wrestlers.

The Union government wrote a letter to Indian Olympic Association a day after several athletes, including Olympic bronze medal winners Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia as well as Commonwealth Games gold medal winner Vinesh Phogat, resumed their protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar seeking action against Singh.

In its letter, the sports ministry said the elections of the executive committee, which is headed by Singh, have to be conducted within 45 days of the formation of the ad-hoc panel. The ad-hoc committee has also been tasked to manage the day-to-day affairs of the Wrestling Federation of India till the polls are conducted.

“It is understood that the election to the executive committee has been scheduled on May 7, 2023,” the letter said. “In this regard, considering the current situation, it is expedient that the said election process should be treated as null and void and that fresh elections to the executive committee should be conducted under a neutral body/returning officer.”

The country’s top wrestlers had first levelled the allegations against Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj, on January 18 during a protest at the same site. They, however, ended the demonstration after marathon talks with Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.

On January 23, the sports ministry formed an oversight panel, headed by boxer MC Mary Kom, to investigate the matter. The committee had been instructed to submit its findings within a month. But the committee submitted its report in the first week of April.

Seven women wrestlers, including a minor, have also filed a sexual harassment complaint against Singh at the Connaught Place police station in Delhi. However, a first information report has not been filed yet.

The Delhi Police have asked for a report from the oversight committee after the protest started again, an officer told PTI on Monday. “The FIR will be registered after concrete evidence comes to light,” he added.

In its letter, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports said that the oversight panel investigating the allegations found that the Wrestling Federation of India did not have an Internal Complaints Committee as is mandated under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act.

It also found a lack of awareness-building measures among sportspersons for their grievance redressal and recommended more transparency and consultation between the wrestling federation and the athletes.

On Monday, the wrestlers moved the Supreme Court seeking registration of the first information report against Singh, reported Mirror Now. The court is likely to hear their plea on Tuesday.

‘Podium to footpath’

Earlier in the day, Phogat shared a photo of wrestlers sleeping in the open on a footpath. “Podium to footpath,” she wrote. “In the hope of justice under the open sky at midnight.”

Phogat told reporters that the protesting wrestlers have “lost faith in the system”.

She added that the athletes have been trying to reach out to Thakur and other authorities for three months, NDTV reported.

“The members of the committee are not responding to us, sports ministry has also not said anything, they don’t even pick up our calls,” Phogat said. “We have won medals for the country and have put our careers at stake for this.”

Punia vowed that the athletes will not back down till Singh is punished, reported ANI. “This time, all parties are welcome to join our protest whether it is the BJP, Congress, AAP or any other party,” he added.

Singh, who has completed 12 years as the Wrestling Federation of India president, has denied the allegations against him. Last week, he had hinted that he might look for a new role within the governing body. He is not eligible to contest elections this time under the government’s Sports Code as he has completed three four-year terms as president.

A complaint has also been filed with the Delhi Commission for Women. Its head Swati Maliwal on Sunday wrote to the deputy commissioner of police, saying “this is a very serious matter” concerning the safety and security of women wrestlers.

Maliwal asked the police about the reasons for the delay in filing the FIR. “Some of the complainants and their family members have started getting phone calls enquiring about the identities of the complainants from an IPS [Indian Police Service] officer posted in Department of Sports,” she said.

On January 23, the sports ministry had formed a oversight committee, headed by boxing legend MC Mary Kom, to investigate the allegations by the wrestlers.

The committee was given a one-month deadline. But the panel submitted its report in the first week of April and its findings have not been made public so far, according to PTI. Singh had appeared before the Indian Olympic Association and the government’s oversight committee in connection with the case.

Earlier this month, Phogat had said that the athletes have lost faith in the committee and were considering legal action against Singh.

“Why is there secrecy over the findings of the oversight committee and the details about how they went about the probe?” she had asked. “Women wrestlers have shown the courage to speak about what they faced but it seems like their words don’t matter.”

Singh, who has completed 12 years as the Wrestling Federation of India president, has denied the allegations against him. But the athletes have insisted that they know at least 10-12 women who have been sexually harassed by him.

Wrestlers, including but not limited to Phogat, Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia and Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik organised a sit in protest in New Delhi Jantar Mantar in January to protest the functioning of the WFI.

While Brij Bhushan Singh denied the allegations, the Union Sports Ministry asked the BJP MP from Kaiserganj to step down from his role and set up an Oversight Committee to probe the allegations and set a deadline of one month to submit its findings. Phogat, Punia and Malik had expressed their disappointment in not being consulted by the Sports Ministry in the setting up of the OC.

“Why is there secrecy over the findings of the Oversight Committee and the details about how they went about the probe? Women wrestlers have shown the courage to speak about what they faced but it seems like their words don’t matter. We have raised a very sensitive issue which concerns the safety of women wrestlers,” Phogat, a three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist told The Indian Express.

“We have lost faith in the committee. We received some assurances from the government but they were not fulfilled too. We do not know the status of the report filed by the committee as well. Every time we ask what is the status and finding of the Oversight Committee report, there is no response from anyone,” she added.

Phogat also said that she and Punia tried to reach out to OC member MC Mary Kom and Sports Minister Anurag Thakur but received no response.

“We are left with no other option but to approach the court in our fight for justice. Stepping back is not an option now,” Phogat said.

The 28-year-old also alleged that though the Brij Bhushan had been removed from his post of WFI chief, he still runs the day-to-day affairs of the federation. She pointed out that the Open National Senior Ranking Wrestling Tournament for Women and Greco Roman has been scheduled to be held at Nandini Nagar in Gonda from April 16 to 18.

Brij Bhushan hails from Gonda and the district is a part of his Lok Sabha constituency and is considered to be his stronghold.

“Nandini Nagar in Gonda was chosen despite us saying what all had happened to women wrestlers earlier. How can this even happen?

On January 18, India’s leading wrestlers began a protest at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar demanding action against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the president of the Wrestling Federation of India, following allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse. On January 21, Sports Minister Anurag Thakur said Singh had been asked to step down until a high-level committee completes an investigation into the allegations.

Sexual exploitation in sports is a by-product of the skewed power dynamic between athletes and federations. This flawed structure is the result of decades of misguided, and sometimes malicious, policies formulated for Indian sports, as well as the centralisation of control in the hands of the state.

Change will only come in Indian sport from challenging these entrenched power structures and empowering athletes to speak up against exploitation.

Minimum consensus, power nexus

Sports is one of the few activities that unifies Indians. There is a common minimum consensus among all arms of the state that sports is to remain a closely guarded domain that is under their control. This reflects in the failed attempts at a sports law over the years that garnered cross-party unity in throttling the bills, such as the National Sports Development Bill, 2011, or the draft National Sports Development Bill, 2013.

For instance, in 2011, leaders of the Congress-led ruling United Progressive Alliance opposed the National Sports (Development) Bill because they stood to lose their influence with the national sports federation. The cabinet, thus, vetoed a bill by its own member. A few years later, the Draft National Code for Good Governance in Sports, 2017, was scrapped after disagreements over provisions.

Similarly, every new reform policy that is proposed to enhance the smooth functioning of sports bodies actually comes at the expense of the transparency and accountability of national sports federations.

In Indian sports, power is centralised in a committee or representative of the state – a judge, bureaucrat or politician. Procedural compliance and sports codes change willy-nilly based on the regime in power. Any kind of reform will be futile unless this power nexus with the state is exploded.

The policy of appointing chief executive officers to run national sports federations is flawed as the system of nominations and shortlisting of candidates extends the state’s de facto control. Appointments are politicised and highly subjective. An independent form of recruitment that tests a candidate’s lived and learned experience will be a step in the right direction.

Although there has been a rise of athlete administrators, they remain figureheads with little power without the political backing of the ruling regime. For sports bodies to effectively exercise power, they must be divorced from the state.

Creating a national sports ombudsman, with representatives drawn from civil society and sports, would be a possible alternative to the existing institutional framework.

The formulation of sports policy should involve a mix of experts – as former athletes, policy analysts, academics and human rights or equality opportunity activists – with real say in the process, which will ensure effectiveness, equal opportunity and welfare.

While politicians provide policy direction, it is bureaucrats who write sports codes and policies. Given the power these state actors hold, policy formulation by experts will not be effective unless their overreach is checked. Thus, bureaucrats, judges and other state actors should have clearly defined roles and stick to them.

Policy tweaks

Indian cricket continues to churn out talent and winners not because all the cricketing talent in the world is born in India but because cricket, right from the grassroots level to the top, is an attractive career.

A Ranji Trophy cricketer has financial security, leaving them free to work on perfecting their art, raising the overall level of competition in the country. This incentive is missing in other sports.

The current thrust of India’s strategy for the Olympics is to identify potential talent and give them the best training and facilities to ensure their success. While well-intentioned, a considerable amount of money is being spent on creating the right infrastructure and facilities for athletes.

A good representation of this approach is the Mission Olympic Cell, which runs the Target Olympic Podium Scheme of the Sports Authority of India. It is based on the flawed premise that India needs to find or produce its own Lionel Messi.

Given India’s population, it is a statistical inevitability that people with the once-in-a-generation talent of Lionel Messi or sprinter Usain Bolt are already being born in the country. The problem is that they are not incentivised to keep playing the sport.

To leverage India’s edge over other nations with its population and demographic dividend, sports policies have to be tailored to reduce dropouts. This is only possible if an enabling environment that nurtures athletes is created, complete with avenues for them to find fruitful post-career employment, mid-career training, education and more.

For example, the Short Service Commission model for the armed forces, in which officers serve for a limited period that enables them to change careers after service, could be adapted for the sports ecosystem.

Data vacuum

Research in sports as a field of study is woefully underdeveloped in India. The data on Indian sports is inadequate and a centralised collection system is needed urgently.

Superficial metrics such as financial allocations and output in terms of medals are measured. The focus of data collection needs to move past this to delve into a SWOT analysis of the entire ecosystem to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

Annual data on the number of dropouts from each kind of sport and examining why should be priority. Data on the age, gender and sport category of those dropping out will give a comprehensive picture of the flaws in India’s sports policy.

Such data should widely be made available to independent think tanks and scholars for analysis that will help enhance the academic rigour of sports. Academic programmes in newly established sports universities in India are limited to sports science. The acceptance of sports policy as an emerging and exciting field of research can benefit India across sectors.

Amnesty scheme

Finally, empowering athletes to speak up whenever they are aware of exploitation is key to the success of the sports ecosystem and ensuring that national sports federations are held accountable.

The current system is designed to punish athletes for speaking up. They fear rigged selection trials, the imposition of legal technicalities and strong-arming by office bearers if they speak up.

A way around this is to offer whistle-blowing athletes short-term amnesty from administrative backlash from their federations. If the fear of never playing again in significant competitions is taken away, most athletes will be forthcoming in their experience within the system.

Since sports is a field where performances are easily compared and reduced to numbers that are hard to argue against, ensuring that whistle-blowers are guaranteed a trial and a fair shot at maintaining their careers after they speak up is not a difficult proposition.

An amnesty scheme giving an athlete a transparent yet separate selection trial where they have the opportunity to match the eligibility markers set up for national qualifications will bring further accountability and scrutiny into the politics of sports selections in India.

There is no comprehensive set of reforms that can address all the problems that plague Indian sports, but a major cause has been the historical lack of scrutiny.

Although things are changing, the culture created by vested interests will continue to influence all policies unless it is tackled head-on. All reform must first address this aspect.

The committee also took over the day-to-day administration of the sport’s body till the investigation is completed.

“We were assured that before the Oversight Committee was set up, we would be consulted,” Phogat, Punia and Malik said in a similar tweet. “It is very sad that our views were not taken before the committee was formed.”

In a letter to the Indian Olympic Association on Friday, the wrestlers had demanded that Singh be removed as chief of the sports federation and the Wrestling Federation of India to be dissolved and replaced with a new one in consultation with them.

The three wrestlers had made the allegations last week against Singh and other members of the sport’s body accusing him of sexual exploitation and intimidation. Phogat had alleged that she knows at least 10 to 12 wrestlers who have been sexually harassed by Singh.

Besides allegations of sexual harassment, wrestlers have accused the Wrestling Federation of India of financial mismanagement.

Phogat had alleged that she knows at least 10 to 12 wrestlers who have been sexually harassed by Singh.

The committee, which is expected to complete its enquiry in four weeks, will also oversee day-to-day affairs of the sports body.

Six-time boxing World Champion and 2012 London Olympics bronze medallist MC Mary Kom will head the committee, along with London Olympics bronze-medal winning wrestlers Yogeshwar Dutt and 2006 Commonwealth Games bronze medal winner in badminton and Dhyan Chand Awardee Trupti Murgunde.

Last week, some of the country’s top wrestlers like – but not limited to – Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia, two-time World Championship bronze medallist Vinesh Phogat and 2016 Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshee Malikkh, lodged a protest against the Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, accusing him of sexual exploitation and intimidation.

The wrestlers demanded his removal as chief of the sports federation and the Wrestling Federation of India to be dissolved and created afresh in consultation with the grapplers, according to a letter they presented to the Indian Olympic Association.

Subsequently, the sports ministry asked Singh to step down from his position while an Oversight Committee investigated the matter.

Tomar is a close aide of Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexually harassing female players. Singh is a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj constituency.

Several wrestlers, including Olympic bronze medal winners Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, along with Commonwealth Games gold medal winner Vinesh Phogat, have held sit-in protests in Delhi and meetings with the sports ministry over the last week, demanding Singh’s resignation and the dissolution of the sports body.

On Saturday, the sports ministry said in a circular that Tomar was being suspended as his “continued presence will be detrimental to the development of this high priority discipline [wrestling]”.

The ministry also suspended all ongoing activities of the Wrestling Federation of India and an oversight committee, appointed by the Centre, will take over the day-to-day activities of the sports body.

The developments emerged after the Wrestling Federation of India on Friday told the Centre that the allegations of sexual harassment against Singh were malicious and unfounded. The Centre had sought a response from the sports body to the allegations. It had also told Singh to step aside from his post till an inquiry by the Indian Olympic Association was complete.

The wrestling federation said on Friday that its committee against sexual harassment has not received any such complaint. It alleged that the athletes protesting at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar were part of “a deeper and a larger conspiracy” and had vested interests.

Singh, who has been heading the Wrestling Federation of India since 2011, has denied the allegations against him by saying that the athletes have no evidence to support them.

He likened the protest against him to the demonstrations at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and claimed that it was organised at the behest of the Congress.

In late 2019 and 2020, the locality of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi was the site of a large sit-in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

A group of wrestlers, including Commonwealth Games gold medalist Vinesh Phogat, have accused the federation president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh – who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP – of sexual misconduct and financial misappropriation. They were demanding that he be removed from the post.

As pressure mounted, Sports Minister Anurag Thakur announced on Friday that Singh would step aside until an inquiry into the allegations is completed.

Whispers about the sexual exploitation of Indian athletes by people in power are unfortunately all too frequent. For sportspeople, arms snaking around their shoulders and dreaded phone calls by a coach or selector demanding a “meeting” are well-known experiences. Everybody knows yet nobody speaks out.

Is this India’s Larry Nassar moment, as the country faces a moment of reckoning just like the US did when the doctor for the country’s national women’s gymnastics team was convicted for sexually abusing hundreds of young women? The outcome of the inquiry in light of the protest by India’s wrestlers may well impact many other sports bodies.

Enabling factors

There are reasons to be optimistic. The protest featuring prominent women athletes, had the vocal support of male athletes and has gained the attention of the head of the Indian Olympic Association, PT Usha. However, the nexus of politicians and vested interests who wish to maintain the status quo in sports administration in India is the biggest stumbling block to achieving substantive change.

Indian sports provide predators looking to exploit vulnerable groups of people with a peculiar combination of enabling factors that few other sectors can match.

The supply line of Indian athletes offers a unique set of opportunities for exploitation. Many Indian athletes are drawn from marginalised communities and lack the awareness that could protect them from exploitation by those in power. The Sports Authority of India model of hostels for promising athletes, while not without its merits, also provides a fertile ground for exploitation. Wards cut off from their families, often at impressionable ages, face constant pressure to choose the seemingly easy way to progress.

There are only two ways to progress in sports, regardless of talent – performance and patronage. Since performance can be limited by the opportunity to perform, especially in team sports, patronage is the de facto route to sporting opportunity and success in India.

A feature that is specific to India, which adds greatly to the nature of exploitation in Indian sports, is the lack of alternatives for athletes. Athletes, if they drop out of the education system, seldom have the opportunity to return and find gainful employment via other routes. By the time they start looking for alternatives, many are aged out of the system of recruitment in government jobs and other fields. This adds a desperate edge to their struggle to achieve sporting success, which is frequently exploited by sports administrators.

Due to the historical ties of powerful politicians to sporting bodies, and the revenue sports provide to media institutions, there is almost an incentivised culture of hushing up whistleblowing. Indian athletes will always be vulnerable because the very nature and structure of sports rely on conforming to established norms and existing within the ecosystem.

Institutional monopoly

A sportsperson cannot represent India without an affiliation to a national sports federation. This institutional monopoly underpins the unequal power dynamic between the sporting body vis a vis the athlete. This is at the root of why so few current athletes can call out the exploitation they face. They have too much to lose.

Finally, Indian sports is a systemic black hole that has often escaped the reformative scrutiny afforded other fields of endeavour. The draft national code for good governance in sports (2017) does not have the teeth to enforce the safeguards and policies necessary to protect and empower our athletes. Because these legal provisions are drafted by the same vested interests that wish to protect the status quo, the crucial intent for change is missing.

Many false da wns have come and gone. Sporadic attempts at wresting accountability via efforts like the Lodha Committee reforms or the National Sports Bill (2011) have swiftly been shut down or worked around via a system of proxies and backdoor appointments that maintain the status quo.

But if India is to truly become a global sports power, reform is essential.

“An Oversight Committee will be set up by the Ministry for the Wrestling Federation of India,” read the statement.

“The Committee will enquire into the allegations made by prominent sportspersons of Sexual Misconduct, Financial Irregularities and Administrative lapses; Undertake day-to-day administration of the WFI; Revisit the issues raised by players.

“The Oversight Committee will complete the enquiry in 4 weeks and till then, WFI president will step aside from the day-to-day functioning and he has assured to cooperate in the investigation.”

On Wednesday, the biggest wrestlers in the country – such as, but not limited to, Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia, three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat, and Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshee Malikkh – lodged a protest at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to highlight the misdemeanours they alleged against Singh, and called for the Wrestling Federation of India president to be removed from his post with immediate effect.

Phogat highlighted Singh’s sexual harassment of women’s wrestlers.

“I know at least 10-20 women wrestlers who have told me about the sexual exploitation they faced at the hands of the WFI president,” she said at a press conference.

The wrestlers wrote a letter to the Indian Olympic Association as well, asking for the body to set up a committee to investigate the sexual harassment allegations against Singh, his resignation, the dissolving of the Wrestling Federation of India, and a committee to be formed to look after the affairs of the sports federation.

Additionally, reacting to the letter sent to them by the wrestlers, the Indian Olympic Association will also set up a committee to investigate the allegations.

The IOA Executive Council – which included International Olympic Committee Athletes Commission Member and Beijing Olympics gold medallist Abhinav Bindra – met virtually on Friday before announcing the creation of the committee.

“The EC unanimously decided that a Committee will be formed in accordance with the Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women Act of 2013 and must hear both sides and submit a report to the IOA President. Instructions have been given to committee to meet at the earliest,” read a statement issued by the Indian Olympic Association.

The committee includes, but is not limited to, London Olympics bronze medallist and six-time World Champion boxer MC Mary Kom, Commonwealth Games gold medallist-archer Dola Banerjee, and London Olympic bronze medal-winning wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt.

The Times of India reported that the wrestlers have called off their protest following the statements by the sports ministry and Indian Olympic Association.","Subsequently, the ministry announced through a statement, that a committee will be formed to enquire into the allegations, and while the investigation will go on, Singh will be asked to step down.

His hands-on approach has often seen him overrule referees and even coaching tactics.

On Wednesday, some of the biggest names of the sport in India came out in protest at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, accusing the 66-year-old of sexual harassment, and putting the Bharatiya Janta Party MP’s reign as chief of the national federation under a cloud.

Among those the protestors are three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat and 2016 Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshee Malikkh. They have accused him of sexually exploiting and intimidating some of their fellow women wrestlers.

On Friday evening, Sports Minister Anurag Thakur announced that Singh would step aside until an inquiry into the sexual harassment charges was completed.

Singh’s reign as wrestling chief has had its ups and downs. Under his charge, India has enjoyed regular success in the international arena regularly, with medals in each of the last four Olympic Games. It has also tasted great success at the Commonwealth Games.

Wrestling fans say that Singh has made sure to be present, either in person or virtually (through cameras setup at venues), at all national- and international-level wrestling events in India.

Singh has brought in a fair deal of focus and financial support to the local dangals – regional wrestling competitions played on mud. But he has a reputation of being overbearing.

Singh has denied the allegations of the protesting wrestlers, claiming that they are politically motivated. But this is not the first time the wrestler-turned-politician has found himself in a controversy.

Pending cases

Singh is a six-time MP – five with the BJP and once with the Samajwadi Party in 2009. He is currently the MP from Kaiserganj in Uttar Pradesh.

A budding wrestler in his youth, Singh entered politics during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in the late 1980s and still has a case pending against him related to the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.

He also has four cases pending in Ayodhya and Gonda, according to his election affidavit for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The charges include robbery, attempt to murder and bribery in connection with elections.

In addition, he claimed to Scroll.in that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had accused him of having killed BJP party candidate Ghanshyam Shukla. The BJP had replaced Singh with Shukla as the candidate from Gonda in the 2004 elections, but Shukla died in a road accident on the day of the elections.

Overstepping boundaries

His heavy-handed approach has frequently drawn him into the headlines. In 2021, he suspended a Railways team coach because the coach had been “too animated”, The Indian Express reported. Later that year, he slapped a wrestler at the Under-15 National Championships when the young grappler was protesting a decision.

Singh has also ordered video referrals and attempted to overturn refereeing decisions. At the national trials for the World Championships last year, he even halted a bout so that sadhus from Ayodhya could bless the athletes. Later at the same event, he had all the athletes sit in front of him and he pointed out their technical flaws.

In an interview with The Indian Express, he said: “These are all strong men and women. To control them, you need someone stronger. Is there anyone stronger here than me?”

In 2021, Phogat had been suspended by the Wrestling Federation of India for not wearing the official singlet at the Tokyo Olympics, and later, at the trials for the World Championships team, athletes were told to declare their entire list of sponsors.

Accusations of sexual exploitation

On Wednesday, the wrestlers protesting in New Delhi accused Singh and the Wrestling Federation of India of mental harassment and corruption. Phogat, a two-time World Championship bronze medallist, also claimed that Singh had threatened to kill her and alleged that Singh and the Wrestling Federation of India were sexually exploiting young wrestlers.

“I know at least 10-20 women wrestlers who have told me about the sexual exploitation they faced at the hands of the WFI president,” she said at a press conference. “They told me their stories. I can’t take their names now, but I can definitely reveal the names if we get to meet the prime minister and the home minister of the country.”

A meeting the wrestlers had on Thursday with sports minister Anurag Thakur proved inconclusive.

On Friday, a letter addressed to Indian Olympic Association chief PT Usha was posted on social media signed by Phogat, Malikkh, Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia, Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Ravi Dahiya and World Championships silver medallist Deepak Punia.

They claimed that the Wrestling Federation of India had misappropriated funds related to contract payments. According to the letter, the Singh allegedly “mentally harassed and tortured” Phogat after she failed to win an Olympic medal in Tokyo, which caused her to contemplate suicide.

In addition, the wrestlers wrote: “It has taken a lot of courage for us wrestlers to come together and protest against the Wrestling Federation of India President. We fear for our lives. If he is not sacked then the careers of all the young wrestlers who have joined this dharna will be over.”

The Indian Olympic Association on Friday formed a seven-member committee to investigate the allegations against Singh.

Update: Following a statement by the Sports Ministry, which has asked Singh to step down for four weeks till a committee investigates the allegations, the wrestlers have decided to call off their protest. According to the ministry’s statement, Singh has “has assured to cooperate in the investigation”.","Among those the protestors are three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat and 2016 Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshee Malikkh.

“It would also be worth drawing attention that even the next election for the management of WFI is due in the near future of the year 2023,” it said.

The federation said that under Singh, it has always acted in the best interests of wrestlers.

“The WFI is managed by an elected body as per its constitution, and therefore, there is no scope for arbitrariness and mismanagement in WFI by any one individually, including the president,” the federation said.

Earlier on Friday, the Indian Olympic Association formed a seven-member committee to investigate the allegations against Singh, PTI reported.

The Indian Olympic Association formed the committee after the wrestlers wrote to its president PT Usha seeking action against Singh and the Wrestling Federation of India.

“Vinesh Phogat was mentally harassed and tortured by the WFI chief after she missed out on an Olympic medal in Tokyo,” the wrestlers told Usha. “She almost contemplated suicide.”

The Indian Olympic body’s probe panel is headed by Olympic medalist Mary Kom and includes former archer Dola Banerjee, London Olympic medalist Yogeshwar Dutt and Indian Weightlifting Federation President Sahdev Yadav.

The association, however, did not respond to the athletes’ demands calling for the resignation of Singh and dissolution of the Wrestling Federation of India.

A National Sports Federation cannot be dissolved unless it has violated the Indian Olympic Association rules or has been de-recognised by the world body of the sport.

Meanwhile, the wrestlers met Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur for a second round of talks on Friday night and decided to call off their sit-in protest, which started on Wednesday afternoon at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar.

“It has been decided that an oversight committee will be formed, names for which will be announced tomorrow [Saturday],” the sports minister said after the meeting that lasted close to five hours. “The committee will complete its investigation within four weeks. It will thoroughly probe all the allegations be it financial or sexual harassment that have been levelled against WFI and its chief.”

Singh, who has been heading the Wrestling Federation of India since 2011, has denied the allegations against him by saying that the athletes have no evidence to support them.

He likened the protest against him to the demonstrations at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and claimed that it was organised at the behest of the Congress.

A group of wrestlers, including Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vinesh Phogat, have accused the Bharatiya Janata Party MP of sexual misconduct and have sought his removal from the post. The wrestlers, protesting at Jantar Mantar in Delhi, are also agitating against the functioning of the sport’s governing body.

On Friday, Singh claimed that the agitation by the wrestlers was part of a conspiracy against him and claimed that “big powers” are behind it.

“The picture becomes clear with the tweets and statements by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Deepinder Hooda,” Singh alleged, according to PTI. “This attack is not only on me but on the Bharatiya Janata Party through me.”

Both Vadra and Hooda have demanded an investigation into the allegations by the wrestlers against Singh and other coaches.

Singh is scheduled to hold a press conference in Gonda later in the evening.

Wrestlers approach Indian Olympic Association

On Friday, the protesting wrestlers wrote to the Indian Olympic Association to form an inquiry committee to investigate the allegations of sexual harassment against Singh.

“In addition, there has been financial misappropriation on the part of the WFI,” the wrestlers alleged in a letter to PT Usha, president of the Indian Olympic Association. “Contract payments were agreed with some of the senior wrestlers in the last few years through sponsorship received from TATA Motors. These payments were only partly made by WFI.”

The letter also alleged mental harassment of Vinesh Phogat by Singh after her defeat in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics following which she contemplated suicide.

“The Coaches and Sports Science staff that WFI President puts in the national camp are absolutely incompetent and not on merit,” the letter alleged. “They are just his [Singh’s] informants and they create a very bad atmosphere in the national camp.”

The wrestlers, including international players like Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, Ravi Dahiya, and Deepak Punia have demanded that the Wrestling Federation of India be dissolved and replaced with a new committee which runs in consultation with the players.

“It has taken a lot of courage for us wrestlers to come together and protest against the WFI President,” the letter said. “We fear for our lives. If he is not sacked then the careers of all your wrestlers who have joined this dharna will be over.”

Punia, however, asserted on Friday that the protestors’ fight was not against the government. “All of us sportspersons are protesting against the federation and its chief,” he said on Twitter. “No political party should politicise our agitation.”

Several athletes, including Olympic bronze medal winners Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia and Commonwealth Games gold medal winner Vinesh Phogat, started a sit-in protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on Wednesday.

The meeting with the sports minister on Thursday remained inconclusive as the wrestlers threatened to step up the protest if their demands of disbanding the Wrestling Federation of India and an investigation against the body’s chief, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, are not met, PTI reported.

Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj, has denied the allegations against him. But the athletes have insisted that they know at least 10-12 women who have been sexually harassed by Singh.

On Thursday night, the protesting wrestlers led by Phogat and Punia met Thakur at his home and sought speedy action. The sports minister told them to wait for an official response to the allegations from the Wrestling Federation of India that his ministry has sought, NDTV reported.

Addressing reporters before the meeting, Thakur said: “Government has worked for the welfare and upliftment of sports and players. India has won a lot of medals and delivered good performances at the global level. Work has been done to make federations better. Allegations levelled by wrestlers are serious in nature.”

Earlier on Thursday, the athletes also met Director General of the Sports Authority of India Sandip Pradhan and Sports Secretary Sujata Chaturvedi.

The wrestlers said they have not received any concrete response and “won’t wrestle another day” till their demands are met, NDTV reported. “We will not quit till the federation chief is removed, and he goes to jail,” they added. “If the government does not act, we will go to the police.”

The protestors also received support from wrestler and BJP leader Babita Phogat, who met them on Thursday. Phogat said that she had heard of instances of abuse in her career as a wrestler as well. “There is no smoke without fire,” she added. “These voices are important.”

Vinesh Phogat said the wrestlers were fighting for their self-respect and urged everyone not to force the athletes who were sexually harassed to reveal their identities, Sportstar reported.

“We don’t want to come forward and say this is what happened to us,” she said. “If we are forced it will be a shame that India’s daughters have to come forward with proof in front of the media that this is what happened to us. We hope we will not see this black day.”

The recent accusations against Singh come weeks after a senior woman athletics coach had accused Haryana Sports Minister Sandeep Singh of sexual harassment.

The wrestlers chose instead to continue their protest, however, until the WFI president is removed and the national federation is dissolved along with all of the state wrestling associations in the country.

Addressing the media after the meeting, Vinesh is quoted as saying, “Unfortunately, we did not get a satisfactory response.”

She added: “Yesterday, we had 1-2 victims amongst us but now we have 5-6 wrestlers, who were harassed. We can’t name them now, after all they are daughters and sisters of somebody. But if we are forced to disclose their identity, it will be a black day.

“It’s not just about his (Brij Bhushan) resignation. We will send him to jail. We did not want to take the legal route, because we had hoped for resolution but if a proper solution is not provided, we will lodge FIRs against the President.”

Phogat also added, “We want the government to take control of WFI and we will not compete in any competition under the current President.”

Bajrang and Sakshi also echoed the sentiment that state wrestling associations should be disbanded in the country because the WFI chief has his loyalists occupying top posts in these sports bodies.

Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaiserganj, has denied the accusations.

Phogat made the allegations during a protest against the functioning of the Wrestling Federation of India at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. Besides Phogat, some of India’s top wrestlers such as Sakshi Malik, Sangeeta Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sonam Malik and Anshu were also present.

Addressing reporters, Vinesh Phogat said that while she has not faced any harassment personally, she alleged that she had received death threats at Singh’s behest.

Singh added that some of the wrestlers present at the demonstration had met him last week.

“Why Vinesh did not talk to me or approached the police at that time?” the BJP MP asked. “Why did she not meet the PM or the sports minister? Why is she saying this now.”

He claimed that some new policies of the federation are causing “a bit of discomfort” to the wrestlers.

In December, Singh had courted controversy after he slapped a wrestler during the under-15 national championship when he insisted on competing after being disqualified.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi Police, told a bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice P S Narasimha that the FIR will be registered today.

""We have decided to register an FIR. It will be registered today. I don't think anything survives,"" Mehta told the bench, which was hearing a plea filed by seven women wrestlers alleging non-registration of an FIR on their sexual harassment allegations against Singh.

The country's top wrestlers have been on a sit-in at Jantar Mantar in Delhi since Sunday demanding action against Singh.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the wrestlers, placed or record an affidavit in a sealed cover which voiced apprehension about the safety of a minor girl, an alleged victim of sexual assault.

""Bearing in mind the content which has been placed on record, we direct the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, to make an assessment of the threat perception and provide adequate security to the minor girl involved,"" the bench said in its order.

It said an affidavit be filed before it on or before May 5, the next date of hearing, about the steps taken for the security of the minor girl.

Sibal said there are seven complainants, including the minor girl, and they all should be given protection.

The bench said its direction for providing security to the alleged minor victim shall not stand in the way of the Commissioner of Police making an independent assessment of the threat perception of the other complainants.

The apex court permitted the solicitor general to share the sealed cover documents supplied by the women wrestlers with the police commissioner and said the city police chief shall maintain utmost confidentiality with regard to the documents.

Sibal, while referring to the affidavit, expressed his worries about the safety and security of the protesting grapplers.

Without naming anyone, he said 14 cases are pending against ""this gentleman"", including one under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.

Mehta said the issue should be left to the city police chief and other responsible officers.

""Mr solicitor, we will record your statement that you are registering an FIR. Second, we will say let Commissioner of Police make an assessment of threat perception on what we have on record,"" the CJI said, while making it clear that the apex court is not monitoring the investigation.

When Sibal raised the issue of security to other complainants, Mehta said he has no difficulty over providing them security.

Mehta said, ""There is something else... I will not go into it, it is a sensitive issue. Your lordships know the law. If FIR is not registered, the remedy is 156 (3) (of CrPC). I am not raising that ground... The moment we found there is a cognisable offence, we took a decision that FIR will have to be registered.""

Section 156(3) of the CrPC says any magistrate empowered under section 190 may order investigation by the police in a cognisable case.

""We are in a position that they are in Delhi so they can directly approach your lordships under (Article) 32. There may be similar cases in the country where they would not be able to approach your lordships under 32 and your lordships' judgement takes care and there is already a remedy available if FIR is not registered,"" the top law officer said.

Sibal dwelt on the delay in taking action on the complaint of the protesting sportspersons.

""January 2023 this is formally told that you do something. They did nothing. Nobody does anything. They set up a committee.... these are all part of the records,"" he said, requesting for the probe to be monitored by a retired judge.

Sibal said the moment the federation came to know that something like this has happened, under the law, they were supposed to file an FIR.

""What is the responsibility of an organisation of which I am a member?"" Sibal said, adding, ""They don't do anything.""

""Let the investigation start,"" the bench observed.

On April 26, the Delhi Police had told the top court that some kind of preliminary probe was needed before it can proceed with the registration of an FIR over the sexual harassment allegations.The top court had on Tuesday issued notices to the Delhi Police and others on a plea by the seven women wrestlers, saying the matter is ""serious"" and requires consideration.

Several national award winning wrestlers have been protesting at Jantar Mantar demanding the government make public the findings of an oversight panel that investigated the sexual harassment allegations against Singh, also a BJP MP.

The wrestlers had asserted they won't leave the protest site until Singh is arrested. They had resumed their sit-in protest on Sunday and demanded that the findings of the oversight panel that investigated the allegations be made public.

The committee was set up by the Sports ministry in January after the wrestlers held a three-day sit-in.

Top wrestlers such as Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik staged a sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar in January and accused the WFI boss of sexual exploitation and intimidation. The wrestlers had demanded that WFI be disbanded and its president removed.

The sports ministry had then formed an oversight committee headed by boxing great MC Mary Kom on January 23 and asked it to submit its findings in one month.

Later, it extended the deadline by two weeks and also added Babita Phogat to the probe panel as its sixth member at the insistence of the protesting wrestlers.

But in spite of that, the wrestlers are prepared for a long haul at the famous protest site, where they have assembled to demand the arrest of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who they have accused of sexual harassment and intimidation.

In five days, the wrestlers have spent more than Rs five lakh for arranging mattresses, bed sheets, fans, speakers and microphones, a mini power gen-set, apart from water and food.

Initially, they took mattresses, bed sheets and the sound system on rent, shelling out Rs 27000 for a single day.

Soon they realised that if they have to sit in for a long period, arranging for even little things would become a huge financial burden.

""So we decided to buy mattresses. I bought 80 mattresses from my village Kharkhoda by paying Rs 50,000. We were being charged 12000 a day for all the mattresses. That's a huge sum,"" Somvir Rathi, husband of Vinesh Phogat, told PTI.

""Initially, we had taken speakers and microphones on rent, but the one-day cost was Rs 12,000. It was too much. Now we have bought our own sound system from Chandni Chowk market for Rs 60,000.

""The shopkeeper was nice. He knew that athletes are on the road so he gave us the system on a not-for-profit basis,"" he added.

A few items like fans and generators are still on rent -- both at a combined amount of about Rs 10,000 a day.

""We will buy coolers if the need arises. It's very hot out there. We had brought Rs two lakh cash with us but have already spent about 5-6 lakh rupees so far."" While Vinesh, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia are the face of the protest, people like the unassuming Somvir, his friend Yogesh (Bharat Kesri) and several others are working day and night to keep the protest going.

""We have divided the work among ourselves. A few coaches are ensuring that quality food is being prepared by the cooks while young wrestlers deliver food to the protest site. Another guy makes sure that water supply is uninterrupted and another takes care of cleanliness and one runs errands.

""Even the security personnel help us sometimes."" What will they do with all the things when they wind up from here? ""We will distribute everything to either Gurudwara or a temple. They can make good use of mattresses, speakers and other stuff."" Somvir quietly passed on a big packet of water bottles over the police barricading to one of the wrestlers, who took the package and placed it in one corner of the protest area.

At times Somvir was seen trying to convince the leaders of the 'akhaaras' in Haryana to not send wrestlers to the protest site since handling a big crowd would pose a challenge.

The wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, alleged that the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief is now resorting to strong arm tactics and trying to break the ""victims"" by issuing threats and offering bribes.

Vinesh claimed that the Delhi police has leaked names of the victims to Brij Bhushan, who is using Haryana Wrestling Association secretary general Rakesh and coach Mahavir Prasad Bishnoi to threaten the families of the women wrestlers, who have filed complaints against the WFI chief.

""I don't know who the victims are. I am being dragged into this because I had refused to be on the side of the wrestlers,"" Mahabir Prasad told PTI.

""They wanted me to be with them in the protest but I told them that while they are dear to me and I can help with the coaching part even if they call me in the wee hours, but I won't stand on one side because the federation has also helped me in my career.

Hooda spent about 35 minutes with the wrestlers at the Jantar Mantar, where the grapplers had started their protest in January, demanding the removal WFI President.

While Hooda did not speak, Raj asked the protesting wrestlers to stick to their cause, like the farmers did against the farm laws and said, ""You will emerge victorious"".

On a day when the sports ministry stalled the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) election on May 7 and asked the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to form an ad-hoc committee to run day-to-day affairs of the federation, the protesting wrestlers said they have nothing to do with the polls and would continue to press for a proper investigation into the allegations that Singh sexually harassed women athletes.

Admitting that they made a mistake by ending their protest three months back, the wrestlers, led by Olympians Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, said they were ""manipulated"" by certain people.

""We are not going to listen to anyone now. We will be the face of the protest but we will now be guided by our 'gurujans' (elderly) and 'coach-khalifas' (mentors). It was a mistake to end the protest the last time around. We will not accept any mediator now, we won't let anyone deceive us,"" said Vinesh.

""All we want is that the police files an FIR and investigates the matter. We are citizens of independent India and there are numerous channels to get justice. Won't we get it (justice) from anywhere?,"" she questioned.

The wrestlers have claimed that they went to Connaught Place Police Station to lodge an FIR against the WFI president but the cops refused to entertain their plea.

While Sakshi said they were manipulated, Bajrang also said that they want 'khaps' and other organisations to support their stir.

""We wanted to keep it (protest) apolitical the last time around but now, we want the farmers' organisations, the women's organisation, the 'khaps' to support us."" When wrestlers had began their protest in January, former wrestler and now BJP affiliate Babita Phogat had mediated between the aggrieved wresters and the government.

However it seems that wrestlers are not happy with the way Babita, who was part of the government's oversight panel, conducted herself.

""Maybe she loves politics more than the wrestling now,"" Vinesh said, while taking a jibe at her cousin sister.

Sakshi said their legal team was contemplating approaching the apex court.

""We will go to the Supreme Court. If we are wrong in levelling the allegations, then a counter FIR should be filed against us,"" she said.

Asked if they would reveal the names of the victims, Vinesh said,""The oversight committee was always biased against us. Only the Supreme Court will get to know the identity of the victims, not Brij Bhushan."" Vinesh also said that it benefits only Brij Bhushan that he is an MP from BJP, the party that is currently running the central government.

""Definitely it helps. We don't know if the government is under pressure (from party MP)."" Bajrang added,""You should ask the government why is it quiet? When we win medals for the country, we are felicitated and now that we are on road with our demands, no one is bothered."" On being questioned whether they feel it has become a battle of two states, Haryana from where most wrestlers hail and Uttar Pradesh, the land of WFI supremo, Bajrang shot back, ""When we win medals for the country, we are known as Indian sportspersons. And now when we are fighting for justice, people label it as UP vs Haryana. They (Brij Bhushan) have money and muscle power but we have truth on our side."" Asked if they presented solid evidence before the probe panel, Vinesh said, they told the panel that Brij Bhushan called a woman wrestler in his room and tried to impose himself on her.""

Delhi Commission for Women president Swati Maliwal also took notice of the matter and has also issued a notice to the Delhi Police and has asked why now no FIR has been registered against the complaint filed by the seven female wrestlers.

Speaking about the matter DCW chief Swati Maliwal said, ""The complainant has informed the Commission that several women wrestlers including a minor have alleged that the accused person has indulged in the crime of sexual harassment against them during his tenure at the Wrestling Federation of India.""

""It is my request to the Prime Minister that we should be heard in the matter for which we first sat so that India's wrestling goes into safe hands.

Where did we end up? We want the truth to prevail and India's wrestling to go in safe hands"", Sakshi Malikkh said to ANI.

Coming back to the matter, after the matter came to the notice of the Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur he took the matter seriously and also called the wrestlers for talks after they protested against the WFI president in January this year.

The wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya, had in January raised the issue, but ended their three-day long sit-in after marathon talks with Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.

Thakur had announced the five-member oversight committee, headed by legendary boxer M C Mary Kom, to look into the allegations. The Delhi Commission For Women (DCW) on Sunday said it has received a complaint from the women wrestlers alleging that they had given a written complaint to the city police two days back, but no FIR had not been registered till now.

The complainant informed the Commission that several women wrestlers, including a minor, had alleged that Singh sexually harassed them during his tenure at the WFI. She also said that a complaint was filed at the Connaught Place police station on April 21. She claimed that no action has been taken by the Station House Officer (SHO), Connaught Place police station on the complaint. She also said that when she called the SHO to enquire about the status of the complaint on April 22, she was informed by him that no FIR had been filed and that action shall be taken on the complaint post Monday.

The complainant also alleged that when she asked him for assurance that the FIR shall be filed by Monday, he answered that he could not guarantee it, according to the DCW.

A senior police officer said they have received seven complaints so far. He said some of the complaints pertain to Delhi and some from outside the city. ""We are conducting an inquiry. No FIR has been registered yet,"" he said.

The Delhi Commission For Women (DCW) also noted that they have been informed that some of the complainants and their family members had started getting phone calls from an IPS officer posted in the Department of Sports, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS) enquiring about the identities of the complainants.

Meanwhile, the panel has issued notice to the Delhi Police in the matter and sought an action taken report by April 25. The Commission has sought a copy of the FIR and asked the police to explain the reasons for delay in registration of FIR. The panel also sought details of security provided to the complainants along with details of the persons who allegedly shared the information regarding the matter with officials from the Department of Sports.

""How long is it going to take for the (government) committee to submit its report? It has already been three months and we are still waiting to hear from them. Will the report come out after the girls, who have filed complaints, die?"" questioned world championship medallist Vinesh Phogat.

""We are tired of asking the government to release the findings... We have nothing to do with the (WFI) election process. We are more concerned about our careers. The (Paris) Olympics are upon us and we want to begin preparations in right earnest,"" she added.

Rio Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik said, ""We will not budge from Jantar Mantar"" adding that ""this fight will not stop"".

Expressing solidarity with the protesters, Sharad Pawar's NCP said Union ministers Anurag Thakur and Smriti Irani should step in to address the concerns raised by the top wrestlers.

""Why is Woman and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani avoiding this issue. Would she have not raised it if it had happened in Amethi or Wayanad,” the NCP spokesperson asked.

Crasto said it was sad to see the kind of treatment meted out to the country's wrestlers. “The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and their ministers bask in the glory of our sportspersons when they win laurels, but now the same are betraying them in their hour of need,” the NCP spokesperson said.

The Committee, led by legendary boxer MC Mary Kom, was formed on January 23 to investigate into the claims made by country's top wrestlers that Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) boss Brij Bhushan has sexually harassed several women wrestlers, intimidates the athletes and run the sport body in an autocratic manner.

Brij Bhushan arrived with his 20-odd supporters for the meeting which went on for nearly three hours.

""Brij Bhushan appeared before the committee today. He straightaway denied all the allegations. He said he never did anything wrong,"" a sports ministry source told PTI.

Brij Bhushan, however, evaded the waiting media at the SAI headquarters here, saying the investigation is still on and he won't like to make any comment at this point of time.

The allegations were levelled by prominent grapplers such as Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya.

The wrestlers have already deposed before the committee.

In January, the country's top wrestlers had staged a three-day sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar, demanding that Brij Bhushan be removed and WFI be disbanded.

The BJP MP was later asked to step aside till the completion of the probe into his alleged misconduct.

The Mary Kom-led committee has former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former shuttler Trupti Murgunde, SAI member Radhica Sreeman and Rajesh Rajagopalan, ex-CEO, Target Olympic Podium Scheme and CWG gold medallist Babita Phogat as its members.

The wrestlers have also alleged that one member of the committee, apparently 2012 London Olympic bronze medallist Dutt, is leaking sensitive information related to the probe with media.

In a statement, Vinesh Phogat requested protesters to maintain peace and urged police not to stop the protesters. Sakshi Malik said in her statement she was yet to decide the next course of action, and her lawyers were working on the plan. She further said Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had not approached them yet. She said, “He already knows our demands, so it doesn’t make sense to meet him again. If he wants to talk to us, we will definitely talk.”

According to PTI, a group of farmers who tried to enter Delhi to join protests were stopped by Delhi Police at the Tikri border.

Meanwhile, the Home Minister of Haryana Anil Vij also extended support to the protesting wrestlers. He said, “This entire matter is now being addressed at the highest level. Since I have also been a sports minister, my sympathies and support are with the protesting wrestlers. If they want me to meditate and talk to the government, I am willing to do so.”

In a statement, Anurag Thakur said the police were conducting an unbiased investigation into the matter. He said, “A demand had been put forward to form a committee and a panel was constituted. Two FIRs have also been registered by Delhi Police and Supreme Court also gave its verdict. Delhi Police is conducting a fair investigation.” He further added free and fair elections of the WFI were also being taken into consideration and Indian Olympic Association was working towards it.

Wrestler protest

On April 23, ace wrestlers Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat, and Bajrang Punia launched a second round of protests against Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, alleging he sexually harassed hundreds of female wrestlers. The first round of protests took place in January this year. It was called off after Sports Minister Anurag Thakur formed a committee to investigate the matter. Following the fresh wrestlers’ protest, Delhi Police filed FIRs against Singh based on the complaints of seven athletes.","On Sunday, May 7, Khap panchayat leaders from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana are gathering at Jantar Mantar in Delhi to show solidarity with the protesting wrestlers.

The woman who heckled PT Usha was later seen crying with the protesting wrestlers in the night. She has been identified as Sudesh Goyat, a career protestor who was seen at almost every protest that made national and international headlines.

Can't believe IOA president legend athlete PT Usha is being humiliated like this. Protester wrestlers won't achieve anything out of this. Why media is not covering this?pic.twitter.com/N2n7SfM9hc — The Hawk Eye (@thehawkeyex) May 3, 2023

In the video, Goyat points the finger at PT Usha and says, “But you have disrespected women”. When someone asked her not to disrespect her, she said, “Why not? When she got medals, we respected her. Now she is disrespecting those who got medals…” and then she went inaudible in the video.

OpIndia decided to dig into her career as a professional protester. During the recent protest, she is being widely covered by several media outlets for two reasons. First, she is a popular face in protests. Second, she is the wife of an Army veteran.

In a 23-minute long video by National Dastak dedicated to Goyat’s thoughts on the wrestler’s protest, she claimed that the administration cut the electricity supply. Interestingly, it was earlier reported that the administration does not provide electricity to any protesters at the site. They have to arrange their own generator. She further claimed that the wrestlers are not seeking Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s resignation but are protesting to get justice for the athletes who were allegedly harassed. However, one of the demands that wrestlers have put forward is the resignation of Singh.

She further claimed no one questioned when only one state brought medals to the wrestling tournaments. Notably, WFI changed the selection process in 2021 to ensure other states get a chance in qualification rounds for the international tournaments. It is allegedly one of the reasons that the wrestlers of Haryana are not happy with Singh’s leadership at WFI. Recently, in a statement in front of the media, Vinesh Phogat clearly stated the wrestlers protesting would not compete in nationals and would prefer to compete in the Olympics directly.

In a recent interview with The Janta Live, she claimed the government sent PT Usha as part of its conspiracy to end the protests. When it did not work, they attacked the wrestlers at night. Her claims do not add up with the series of events that happened last night. There were clear instructions from the Police that no one could enter the protest site at night. However, AAP leader Somnath Bharti brought cots at around 11 PM. When he was stopped, a scuffle broke down between wrestlers and police. Later, DCW chairperson Swati Mahiwal also reached the spot after 12:30 AM, but the police detained her. When she refused to leave, female police personnel gently picked her up and put her in the van and made sure she did not get hurt during the process.

Notably, Goyat was seen crying when Vinesh Phogat gave a statement to the press after the scuffle between wrestlers and police.

Goyat claimed the Pulwama attack happened inside Army Cantt

In an interview with The Janta Live on April 26, Goyat made a bizarre claim that the Pulwama attack happened inside Army Cantt. She accused the government of conspiring the attack that resulted in the death of 40 soldiers. However, her claims are false, as the attack occurred on a National Highway from where the convoy carrying the soldiers passed.

Essentially, Goyat used the wrestlers’ protest to lie about the Pulwama Attack and also shift blame from Pakistan to Indian govt.

OpIndia scrolled through the social media accounts of Goyat. We found that whenever a protest found its way into the national and international media, Goyat became part of it.

She was actively involved in the farmer’s protest. In a video during the protests, she claimed women are not considered farmers. It is notable that the government has worked extensively for the women indulged in farming. The government of India had instructed states and other implementing agencies to incur at least 30% of expenditure on women.

Schemes like Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) are proving to be beneficiaries for women in farming. Despite such schemes, protesters like Goyat often use different platforms to make unsubstantial claims.

Twitter user Total_woke_ pointed out that Goyat has been seen in every possible anti-Modi protest. She allegedly abused Hindus and even supported Khalistanis.

She also found her way to Time magazine. Time wrote, “A gender-rights activist from Haryana, Sudesh Goyat, has been at the Tikri protest site since the very beginning, helping mobilize women and organize for January 18 to be recognized as Women Farmers Day. “Women work equally in the fields with the men. It’s only right they should be here to protest,” she says. “The awareness among women about their own power has never been higher than now.”

Twitter user Mr Sinha pointed out Goyat protested against Agnipath Scheme as well.

She was there in protest against the Agnipath scheme as well.

After politicians made a beeline to the protest venue for their political benefits and ‘Modi Teri Kabar Khudegi’ slogans were raised, now any-India ‘Azadi’ slogans were raised in the venue on 4th May 2023. A group of Muslims and other self-styled activists appeared at the protest venue and raised various slogans against PM Modi, RSS, and BJP in the name of supporting the wrestlers who are protesting at Jantar Mantar in Delhi.

According to a report by Khabar India, a group of Muslims and other self-styled activists appeared at the protest site in the afternoon and raised Azadi slogans, and slogans against PM Modi, RSS, and BJP. The protestors alleged that Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is the culprit and the BJP government is sacking him. The protestors demanded the arrest of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and alleged that the Delhi police are working under the pressure of the central government.

The protestors newly joining the wrestlers today included many students and youths including hijab-clad young Muslim girls. Along with various placards, an apparently scripted list of slogans written on paper was also seen with the protestors. Some of them also used mobile phones to read out the slogans.

The sloganeers also mentioned the so-called Muslim victims of mob lynching including Mohammad Akhalaq and Junaid Khan. Salman Abbasi – one of the Muslims supporting the wrestlers said that there is unrest in the minds of Muslims in India. He said that the whole Muslim community is against the government in this protest and supports the wrestlers. He said that Beti Bachao and Beti Padhao is just a slogan for BJP. “They do not save girls and they do not educate girls. See what they have done in Madhya Pradesh. If a person from another party does anything, they put the entire IT cell after him. We hope for justice from the courts and Allah”, he said. He also added that if any Muslim in the country raises his voice for justice, he is likely to be jailed under this regime.

Another protestor said, “They are asking why are we asking for freedom. We are asking for freedom which means Azadi. Why a wrestler like Vinesh Phogat has to suffer? She is a diamond of the country.”

The wrestlers who have levelled allegations of sexual harassment against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who is also a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar since 23 April.

The scuffle yesterday is said to have broken after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) politician and an MLA from Malviya Nagar, Somnath Bharti arrived at Jantar Mantar with folding beds for the wrestlers without any permission. The Delhi Police spotted Bharti and said that he did not have permission to see the wrestler, given that in the evening, no outsiders were allowed inside the barricade.

After a few minutes, the wrestlers also got involved and the Police detained Bharati and his supporters who arrived at the spot. The matter further escalated as the wrestlers claimed that the Delhi Police were drunk and they misbehaved with the wrestlers. The police, according to the wrestlers, also caused injuries to Dushyant Phogat and other wrestlers. Now, Azadi slogans are raised at the wrestlers’ protest.

It is notable that similar slogans were raised by protestors in many protests in the past. Anti-CAA protests, Shaheen Bagh protests, farmers’ protests, and various other protests in JNU are known for these Azadi slogans. Now, these sloganeers have also joined the wrestlers’ protests.","After politicians made a beeline to the protest venue for their political benefits and ‘Modi Teri Kabar Khudegi’ slogans were raised, now any-India ‘Azadi’ slogans were raised in the venue on 4th May 2023.

The wrestlers who have leveled allegations of sexual harassment against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh are protesting at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar since 23 April.

The bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narsimsha, and Justice JB Pardiwala stated that the plea had been filed by the wrestlers seeking registration of an FIR against Singh. It noted that the purpose of the plea had been served with Delhi Police registering an FIR in the case.

SC says that we have closed the proceedings at this stage. SC says if petitioners wish for something else, they can… pic.twitter.com/irIqwLuZv8 — ANI (@ANI) May 4, 2023

The bench further offered liberty to the applicants to go to the jurisdictional magistrate or invoke the remedy under Section 482 CrPC before the Delhi High Court in case of any further problems. Senior Advocate Narender Hooda, the attorney for the petitioners, asked the court to keep an eye on the inquiry while taking into account the Delhi Police’s alleged behavior in holding off the action till the Supreme Court intervened. The bench, however, rejected this argument and stated that the petitioners were free to pursue other remedies.

“Keeping in view the conduct of the Delhi Police, I request the investigation to be monitored by either this court or a retired judge. Once it is disposed, the Delhi police will drag its feet”, the petitioner’s counsel urged. To this, the CJI responded by saying, “We have only said that we are closing the proceedings at this stage, confining ourselves to the prayers. We have not said that this is not worthy of being monitored. You can approach the Magistrate or the Delhi HC if there are any issues.”

The court further observed in the decision that the Delhi Police recorded the statement of the minor plaintiff on April 29 and the testimonies of four others on May 3 and that police are taking procedures to record their statements before the Magistrate under Section 164 CrPC. The order also included a statement from the police about the precautions taken to protect the complainants.

The Delhi Police was represented by Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, who informed the bench that security arrangements had been provided for the juvenile complainant in accordance with the court’s instructions. The Delhi police investigation determined that there is no perceived threat in relation to the six additional adult complainants, but security was deemed appropriate and has been provided.

According to the SG, three of the complainants are stationed at Jantar Mantar where they are conducting demonstrations against Brij Bhushan. Three armed police officers are also stationed there. The SG said that the case’s inquiry is moving forward.

The petitioners’ attorney cited media accounts of the altercation that took place between the Delhi police and the wrestlers at the protest site last night. The SG responded by stating that two party leaders went there with beds, which the police attempted to stop, resulting in an altercation. The medical exams, according to SG, disproved the claims that the cops were intoxicated. The bench informed the petitioners’ attorney that other matters were outside the petition’s purview because it had essentially been filed to get an FIR.

The Delhi Police informed the Supreme Court during the last session that it would file an FIR against WFI President Singh over the complaint of female wrestlers. Later, two FIRs were filed against him, the first under the POCSO Act on the basis of complaints from a young wrestler and the second on the basis of complaints from other wrestlers who are female.

One of the protesting wrestlers, Vinesh Phogat also meanwhile claimed that drunk police officers abused her during the scuffle. “I was abused and pushed around by policemen. Where were the women police personnel? If you want to kill us, kill us. Did we win medals for the country to see this day? We have not even eaten our food. Does every man have a right to abuse women? These policemen are holding guns, they can kill us,” she was quoted as saying.

Geeta Phogat also tweeted to claim that the Delhi Police had caused injury to her little brother, Dushyant Phogat. However, the viral video tells a different story.

Reportedly, Bajrang Punia, another wrestler has called for support from farmers in their protest against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. “Delhi Police’s high-handedness will not work anymore. We will call farmers to assemble here in numbers. We will not tolerate it anymore. Tractors or trolleys, whatever you get, just come here. I request everyone to reach Delhi by Thursday morning. This is the time. If not, then when? This is a question of the dignity of our daughters. People like Brij Bhushan are roaming freely despite being criminals and all this is happening to us,” he said.

According to Delhi Police, a confrontation between Bharti and his followers and law enforcement officials occurred when they attempted to remove the folding beds from their vehicles in an ‘aggressive’ manner.

“During the protest at Jantar Mantar, Mr Somnath Bharti came to the protest site along with folding beds without permission. On intervention, the supporters became aggressive in trying to get the beds out of the truck.

No. Here are the facts,"A copy of a letter claimed to be written by Indian wrestlers Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on behalf of the protesting wrestlers following the alleged altercation between the wrestlers and the police at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on Wednesday (May 3) has gone viral on social media.

Several social media users including some ‘journalists’ have taken to Twitter to share a copy of the purported letter. Various media outlets have also reported on this purported letter claimed to be written by Bajrang Punia to HM Amit Shah.

However, the letter has turned out to be fake, as the wrestlers themselves have fact-checked the assertion and confirmed that no such letter had been written to HM Amit Shah by them. In fact, Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who has been protesting with her peers at Jantar Mantar, took to Twitter on May 4, to call the letter fake.

Phogat has, in fact, put out two tweets on the issue. In her first tweet posted earlier in the day, she shared a screenshot of a tweet posted by ‘journalist’ Ranvijay Singh wherein he had shared a copy of the purported letter. The ‘journalist’ captioned the tweet, in Hindi which translates to, “Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat have written a letter to HM Amit Shah, hope Amit Shah would pay heed.”

Notably, the journalist deleted his tweet after Vinesh Phogat took to Twitter to fact-check him.

In the subsequent tweet, Vinesh Phogat reconfirmed that no such letter has been written to HM Amit Shah on behalf of the protesting wrestlers.

It may be recalled that yesterday (May 3) at around 11 PM, a scuffle broke down between the protesting wrestlers and Delhi police at Jantar Mantar after police stopped AAP leader Somnath Bharti from entering the protest site to give folding cots to protesters. Soon after, this purported letter, signed by Bajrang Punia and addressed to Home Minister Amit Shah started circulating on social media.

Several users shared a copy of the letter which was dated May 4, 2023, with claims that the protesting wrestlers have written to Amit Shah after the scuffle broke out at Jantar Mantar yesterday (May 3).

The letter also spoke about the scuffle that had broken down between the protesting wrestlers and Delhi police at Jantar Mantar.

PT Usha heckled by protestors, late-night scuffle with Delhi police

On May 3, at around 11 PM, a scuffle broke down between the protesting wrestlers and Delhi police at Jantar Mantar after Aam Aadmi Party leaders, including Somnath Bharti and DCW chairperson Swati Mahiwal, visited the protest site with the police detaining Somnath Bharti and AAP supporters.

Yesterday’s fiasco at Jantar Mantar started much earlier with PT Usha being heckled and manhandled by the protestors. PT Usha had visited the protest site to meet the wrestlers. A video made it to social media where she was seen being hackled by some protesters that raised concerns about her safety at the protest site. She had to escape with the help of security personnel present at the site.

Here it becomes imperative to recall that it was after the video of PT Usha being manhandled went viral, did news emerge of another scuffle at Jantar Mantar. As per Delhi Police, the entry of any outsider was banned post-evening. Reports suggest that Somnath Bharti visited the protest site to provide them with folding cots in the late hours on the instructions of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Protesters called for mass movement towards Delhi

After the alleged scuffle, Bajrang Punia said, “We’re in need of the support of the whole country; everyone must come to Delhi. Police using force against us, abusing women and doing nothing against Brijbhushan.” He called for everyone to pick up tractors and march towards Delhi. Another protester said, “Do not wait for the morning. Reach here by morning”.

Wrestlers protest

On April 23, ace wrestlers Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia launched a second round of protests against Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, alleging he sexually harassed hundreds of female wrestlers. The first round of protests took place in January this year. It was called off after Sports Minister Anurag Thakur formed a committee to investigate the matter.

Following the fresh wrestler’s protest, Delhi Police filed FIRs against Singh based on the complaints of seven athletes. The entry of politicians in the protests and slogans like ‘Modi teri kabar khudegi’ have raised concerns over the actual motive behind the protests.

The ‘journalist’ captioned the tweet, in Hindi which translates to, “Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat have written a letter to HM Amit Shah, hope Amit Shah would pay heed.”Notably, the journalist deleted his tweet after Vinesh Phogat took to Twitter to fact-check him.

They are in protest against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), who they claim has sexually assaulted a number of female competitors.

She was spotted conversing with the wrestlers including Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat, and Bajrang Punia. Nearly a week after she slammed the athletes protesting on the streets constituted indiscipline and damaged the nation’s reputation, she arrived at the protest site.

According to Bajrang Punia, she stated that she is supporting the wrestlers and will seek justice on their behalf. She also added that she is an athlete first. She promised to look into the matter and resolve it immediately. She also affirmed that she was misinterpreted.

She (PT Usha) said that she is standing with us and will get us justice and that she is an athlete first and then anything else. She said that she will look into our issue and resolve it as early as possible. We will remain here till Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh goes to jail:… pic.twitter.com/qhKi1jNtow — ANI (@ANI) May 3, 2023

However, the former track-and-field icon left without speaking to the media gathered at the protest site.

This fresh development was witnessed after Sports Minister Anurag Thakur emphatically mentioned that “Prime Minister Narendra Modiji’s government has always stood with players” and “sports and athletes are their priority.”

Boxing legend MC Mary Kom, who also served as the chair of the sports ministry’s oversight committee that produced a report on the allegations of sexual harassment, has not responded to the current demonstrations.

On Tuesday, Om Prakash Karhana, a 36-year-old former shot putter and Asian champion who was on the IOA’s athletes committee, spoke out in favour of the wrestlers. “I’m not speaking on behalf of the athletes commission but my personal view is that if athletes have come out in the open to fight for their rights, the system in the country should take steps to deliver justice to them as soon as possible,” he remarked.

He further pointed out that denying the wrestlers’ accusations would damage Indian sport because the athletes would lose faith in the system. The 36-year-old retired last year.

Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janta Party MP and WFI supremo Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has defended himself against the wrestlers’ charges. He argued that the majority of wrestlers in the nation back him and that just a small number of wrestlers connected to a Congress leader have brought accusations against him.

“90% of the athletes & guardians of Haryana trust the Wrestling Federation of India. A few families and the girls who have levelled allegations belonged to the same Mahadev Wrestling Academy. The patron of the academy is Deepender Singh Hooda,” he countered.

Following their initial protest in January, several prominent wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia, and Vinesh Phogat, returned to Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on April 23 to voice their opposition to the WFI chief.

Hours after the Supreme Court heard the case, the Delhi Police filed two FIRs in connection with allegations that named the six-term member of parliament as an offender.

The IOA had established a committee headed by M C Mary Kom to probe the accusations before the wrestlers made the decision to withdraw their protest. Vinod Tomar, the Wrestling Federation’s Additional Secretary, had also been suspended by the Union Sports Ministry.","The head of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), PT Usha, visited Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on Wednesday, where the country’s top wrestlers have been staging a demonstration for the past 11 days.

He said that the charges against him are levelled by only a small group of wrestlers linked to a Congress leader, and the majority of the wrestlers in the country support him. He also faulted the wrestlers protesting against him for not going to the police and holding protests at Jantar Mantar in Delhi instead.

“90% of the athletes & guardians of Haryana trust the Wrestling Federation of India. A few families & the girls who have levelled allegations belonged to the same Mahadev Wrestling Academy. The patron of the academy is Deepender Singh Hooda,” Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh stated while talking to the media. Deepender Singh Hooda is a Congress leader and currently a member of Rajya Sabha.

“They are also attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The individuals speaking against him and those present around are railway employees. It should be investigated,” he remarked.

He asked the wrestlers to approach the police and the court and assured that he will respect the decision of the court. “You don’t get justice from Jantar Mantar. If you want justice, you have to go to the police, court. They never did that until now. All they did was hurl abuses. We will accept whatever the court decides,” the WFI president said.

“Akhilesh Yadav knows the truth. We know each other since childhood. 80% of the wrestlers in Uttar Pradesh belong to families with Samajwadi Party ideology. They call me ‘Netaji’. They know how their Netaji is,” he responded when questioned about SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s absence from Jantar Mantar even when several opposition leaders including Priyanka Vadra Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal visited there.

In a recent interview, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said, “I am content with the decision of the honourable court. The wrestlers have been raising their demands for so many days and they were protesting for the same. They went to the court and the court also took cognizance. The Supreme Court has ordered that an FIR should be registered and the matter be investigated. I am totally content with the decision. I will cooperate in the investigation wherever necessary.”

“Their demand changes every now and then. You should consider the agitation right from the beginning. At that time they demanded that the WFI president should resign. After that, they brought up the issue of sexual harassment. After that, they demanded that the government should conduct an inquiry,” he continued.

The WFI supremo further commented, “The government formed two committees. the inquiry was completed. They did not wait for the report of the probe by the committees and started a sit-in protest on some other issue. Then they reached the Supreme Court. If they will be satisfied just with my resignation, I will send it to you, and show the resignation to them.”

“Even if I resign, they will say that he is not favouring anybody by resigning, as anyways his term was already over. You tell them to start their practice and stop this protest, I send my resignation to you. If you are asking me to resign, I can resign, but not as a criminal,” he emphasised.

Anti-Modi slogans including “Modi Teri Kabar Khudegi, Aaj Nahi To Kal Khudegi” (Modi you will be buried, tomorrow if not today) were recently heard at the protesting event in the presence of several wrestlers including Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat, Sangeeta Phogat.

Several top wrestlers including Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia, and Vinesh Phogat, returned to Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on April 23 after their initial protest in January, to demonstrate against WFI head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra and former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev have come forward in support of the wrestlers, whereas, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president and former track and field athlete, PT Usha slammed them. “Indian Olympic Association is having a committee for sexual harassment, instead of going to the streets they (protesting wrestlers) could have come to us earlier but they didn’t come to IOA. It isn’t good for sports not only for wrestlers. They should also have some discipline,” she voiced.

Yogeshwar Dutt, a former wrestler who served on a standing committee that first looked into the allegations asserted that without a complaint, police cannot take any action. He added that the wrestlers need to have brought up the issue sooner.

Dutt, who was part of the 6-member Standing Committee that initially probed the accusations, said that police can’t take any action if there is no complaint. He also said that the wrestlers should have raised the matter earlier. He remarked, “Police only act when there is a complaint. They will not do things out of their own accord. Wrestlers must have done this 3 months ago. I have said this before.”

“The government had made two committees but they cannot rule anyone innocent or guilty, they can’t punish anyone. Only the court can do that… Committees are designed to listen to the grievances of both sides and forward the findings,” he emphasised.

Yogeshwar Dutt also extended his support to Rajya Sabha MP PT Usha, who also serves as the President of the Indian Olympic Association. The latter had earlier courted controversy for suggesting that the protests by the wrestlers amounted to indiscipline and that they were damaging the nation’s reputation.

PT Usha had said, “Indian Olympic Association (IOA) is having a committee for sexual harassment, instead of going to the streets they (protesting wrestlers) could have come to us earlier but they didn’t come to IOA. It isn’t good for Sports not only for wrestlers, they should also have some discipline”

While speaking about the ongoing controversy, Dutt emphasised, “Police report has now been lodged…I don’t know what will be the next move of the wrestlers. They will do what they deem fit. Now, the next course of action has to be taken by the police and the Board.”

“Wrestlers wanted FIR to be registered. It has now been done. They should now focus on their practice,” he added. Earlier, on Friday (April 28), the Delhi police registered two First Information Reports (FIRs) against the chief of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

As per reports, the FIRs were lodged at the Connaught Place police station on the complaint of two female wrestlers (one of whom is said to be a minor). Meanwhile, the WFI chief has rubbished allegations of sexual harassment levelled at him by professional wrestlers.

“You should consider the agitation right from the beginning. At that time they demanded that the WFI president should resign. After that, they brought up the issue of sexual harassment.

It was claimed that the Olympics had kept aside a few medals for the protesting wrestlers so they could take them home without competing.

The screenshot read, “We have been closely monitoring the protests by wrestlers in India, and it has been conveyed to us that they want a direct entry in the Olympic games without playing at national level and medical clearance. Hence, the international Olympic committee has decided to keep a few gold medals reserved for the Phogat sisters, which they can take home without playing any game at the Olympics.”

The screenshot, however, was a fake. OpIndia checked the timeline of the Olympics’ Twitter handle and did not find any such tweet.

The origin of the sarcastic tweet

The origin of the sarcastic tweet is the statement that the protesting wrestlers have made. Notably, the wrestlers who are protesting claiming the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh sexually harassed the athletes. In several statements during the protests, they demanded direct entry to the Olympics without competing for the nationals. Ideally, athletes who compete at the national level should get a chance to show their potential on the international platform.

Thank you Vinesh Phogat for exposing yourself..

The issue between the federation and athletes has been boiling up for a long time as these international players want direct entry into the Olympics and other international competitions, without competing in the nationals which is being opposed. In a recent statement, Vignesh Phogat said a separate federation for wrestlers in Haryana has been created and none of the protesting wrestlers would compete in nationals. She claimed they are ready to compete at the Olympics directly.

A video from the protest site shows anti-Modi slogans raised during the protests by some people. Several people were present today at the protest site. It is seen in the video one of them took up the mic and shouted various slogans. However, the slogans were against prime minister Narendra Modi, not Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Others joined him in raising the slogans.

The controversial slogans included “Modi Teri Kabar Khudegi, Aaj Nahi To Kal Khudegi” which means ‘Modi you will be buried, tomorrow if not today’. The person raising slogans also said that if justice is not done, all people from Haryana will come there.

When these slogans were being raised, several wrestlers including Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat, Sangeeta Phogat etc were also present there. However, they didn’t participate in raising these slogans. But when asked about the anti-Modi slogans, some wrestlers defended it, saying that people are angry. Wrestler Sangeeta Phogar said that people are angry against PM Modi for not taking action against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over allegations against him. She claimed that everyone present at the protest site is there to support the protesters, not to indulge in any politics.

On the other hand, Vinesh Phogat tried to distance from the slogans, as she said that nobody can dig anyone’s grave, and she does not believe in such thoughts.

However, the slogans were not the first politicisation of the wrestlers’ protests. Politicians have already started to use the protest for their political benefit by using the protests to target the Modi govt. Politician Pappu Yadav, who is accused in multiple criminal cases including allegedly misbehaving with an air hostess and threatening to hit with slippers, today joined the protest at Jantar Mantar and addressed the gathering. More importantly, he targeted and mocked UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in his speech, clearly indicating his objective behind attending the protests.

Former governor Satyapal Malik also joined the protests on 26 April, who have created controversies by making several comments attaching the Modi government recently.

On Friday, 28th April 2023, the Delhi police told the Supreme Court that it is ready to file an FIR against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, amid a second round of protests by several wrestlers demanding action against him alleging sexual harassment. In his initial reactions to this, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has said that he respects the court order.

When asked whether he will resign, the BJP MP has an indirect answer saying that even if he resigns, wrestlers will say that his term was already over and he is doing no favour by resigning. However, he added that he is ready to resign if that will satisfy the protesting wrestlers.

This is not the first time that Modi Teri Kabar Khudegi slogans are raised. On 23rd February 2023, Pawan Khera and other Congress leaders raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying “Modi Teri Kabar Khudegi”. the opponents of the BJP government in the centre and various states have often used the phrase of burying somebody while registering their so-called protests. Many other Islamists have also raised slogans to bury Hindutva in the past few years, especially during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in 2019 and 2020.

A complaint was lodged with the Aligarh police station regarding certain slogans that were chanted against Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister Yogi Adityanath at Aligarh Muslim University. The shocking slogan in the protest in AMU was ‘Yogi teri kabar khudegi, AMU ki dharti par’ meaning “Yogi, you will be buried in the AMU’s soil”. Similarly, AMU students had raised slogans during the anti-CAA protests saying Hindutva, Savarkar, etc. will be buried in AMU.

While speaking to India Today, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said, “I am content with the decision of the honourable court. The wrestlers have been raising their demands for so many days and they were protesting for the same. They went to the court and the court also took cognizance. The Supreme Court has ordered that an FIR should be registered and the matter be investigated. I am totally content with the decision. I will cooperate in the investigation wherever necessary.”

He further said, “I am not only content with the decision but also I agree with it because I am a citizen of this country and the Supreme Court is the apex court in this country. We cannot disagree with or raise questions on the court. We welcome the decision of the Supreme Court.”

When asked if he would resign for ensuring a fair trial, he said, “Their demand changes every now and then. You should consider the agitation right from the beginning. At that time they demanded that the WFI president should resign. After that, they brought up the issue of sexual harassment. After that, they demanded that the government should conduct an inquiry. The government formed two committees. the inquiry was completed. They did not wait for the report of the probe by the committees and started a sit-in protest on some other issue. Then they reached the Supreme Court. If they will be satisfied just with my resignation, I will send it to you, and show the resignation to them. Even if I resign, they will say that he is not favouring anybody by resigning, as anyways his term was already over. You tell them to start their practice and stop this protest, I send my resignation to you. If you are asking me to resign, I can resign, but not as a criminal.”

According to a report by ABP News, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said that he is happy with the court’s decision. He added that he believes in his Karma and that he will get justice.

Wrestler Vinesh Phogat said, “The court’s decision has come, but we do not trust the Delhi Police. We have been sitting here for 6 days. Our next step will be based on the action of the Delhi Police. Our demand is that he (WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh) be put in jail. I appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on moral grounds that he should be removed from every post. As long as he remains in that post, he will misuse that position and influence the investigation. We have full faith in the Supreme Court.”

Another protesting wrestler Bajrang Punia said, “He (Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh) should be put in jail immediately. We are waiting for the police FIR. We will see under which sections the case is registered. Our phone was not picked up by Union Minister Anurag Thakur.” Sakshi Malik said, “Our protest will end only after he is put in jail and removed from all posts.”

In the meanwhile, some unusual appearances were seen at the protests by wrestlers, which have the potential of raising questions about the true motive of the protests. Politician Pappu Yadav, who is accused in multiple criminal cases including allegedly misbehaving with an air hostess and threatening to hit with slippers, today joined the protest at Jantar Mantar and addressed the gathering. More importantly, he targeted UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in his speech.

Former governor Satyapal Malik also joined the protests on 26 April, who have created controversies by making several comments attaching the Modi government recently.","In his initial reactions to this, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh has said that he respects the court order.

On Sunday, they went back to Jantar Mantar and requested PM Narendra Modi for a meeting to talk about the serious accusations against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president.

Neeraj Chopra, India’s lone Olympic gold medalist in track and field, joined the wrestlers in their call for action and demanded that immediate action should be taken in the matter.

“It hurts me to see our athletes on the streets demanding justice. They have worked hard to represent our great nation and make us proud. As a nation, we are responsible for safeguarding the integrity and dignity of every individual, athlete or not,” he wrote.

“What’s happening should never happen. This is a sensitive issue and must be dealt with in an impartial and transparent manner. Pertaining authorities must take quick action in order to ensure that justice is served,” he added.

India’s World Cup-winning former captain Kapil Dev also posted a story on his official Instagram profile to share his support for the wrestlers. “Will they ever get justice,” he asked posting a picture of a press conference featuring Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik among others.

Earlier, Ravi Dahiya, another wrestler, expressed support for his colleagues. “An army man and a sportsperson is the pride of every nation, and to respect them is the nation’s duty,” he remarked.

The Delhi Police have also received a notification from the Supreme Court about the petition filed by wrestlers against the WFI chief. The wrestlers filed a writ suit asking for the registration of an FIR against the head of WFI for sexually assaulting the female wrestlers.

The president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and former track and field athlete, PT Usha, recently stated that sportspersons protesting on the streets amounted to indiscipline and were tarnishing the image of the country.

Indian wrestlers initially took part in a demonstration at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on January 19, 2023, calling for the dissolution of the WFI and a police inquiry into the accusations against its chairperson of sexually abusing female athletes. Vinod Tomar, assistant secretary of the WFI was suspended as a result of the protest.

Anurag Thakur, the Union Minister of Sports had met the wrestlers and announced the creation of an oversight committee to look into the accusations. The IOA established a seven-member committee under the leadership of M C Mary Kom to look into the allegations before the wrestlers decided to end their protest.

IOA has not finished its probe into the accusations and the panel’s findings have not yet been made public. Now, the wrestlers have returned to Jantar Mantar to resume their agitation after three months, on April 23.","Neeraj Chopra, India’s lone Olympic gold medalist in track and field, joined the wrestlers in their call for action and demanded that immediate action should be taken in the matter.

The IOA also established a three-person ad hoc panel, comprised of former shooter Suma Shirur, Bhupendra Singh Bajwa, and a yet-to-be-named retired high court judge, to manage the WFI’s operations until a new body is elected.

After the protest first began in January, the IOA and the government were able to pacify the wrestlers by promising to look into their claims against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and the WFI.

On the other hand, wrestler Bajrang Punia, on Thursday, refuted Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur’s assertion that he engaged with the protesting wrestlers for 12 hours to settle their issues.

Bajrang Punia said, “The sports minister is saying that he spoke to the players for 12 hours. Once ask the Sports Minister for how long you were sitting among the players. He sat for 2-4 minutes with the players. His officials were mediating with the players.”

Vinesh Phogat, a wrestler and one of the three main protesters against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, claimed that at the meetings that were held to find a solution, the wrestlers were occasionally even intimidated.

Earlier in the day Anurag Thakur held a press conference in Shimla where he spoke about the issue. In addition to reiterating its commitment to an “impartial probe” into the allegations against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, he said that the government provided all of the protesting wrestlers the opportunity to state their cases before the monitoring committee.

He said, “A few wrestlers are sitting in protest at Jantar Mantar. I have spent 12 hours with them — seven hours on the first day and five hours the next day (in January). I had listened to all their grievances, held a press conference at 2-2.30 at night, and formed a committee after talking to them.”

On Monday, the wrestlers filed a writ petition seeking the registration of an FIR against the President of the Wrestling Federation of India Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh for allegedly sexually assaulting the women wrestlers.

On Monday, senior counsel Narender Hooda, who represents the wrestlers, mentioned the petition before a bench led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud. Because the petition was not on the initial list of listed things on Monday, the CJI directed Hooda to bring it up again on Tuesday. The petition is currently being heard on Tuesday at 10.30 am by a bench led by CJI Chandrachud.

The wrestlers’ appeal cites an unjustified delay in the registration of an FIR by Delhi Police against the WFI president and asks the Supreme Court to issue a directive to the police. “Clearly, the Delhi Police is under political pressure. If this was a regular case, the accused would have been arrested by now. The complainants include a minor, so a case under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act) should also be registered,” advocate Hooda said.

This comes a day after several top Indian wrestlers resumed their protest at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on Sunday, April 23, three months after the allegations were first made public. The protesting wrestlers had levelled an array of accusations against Singh and the federation, including money embezzlement, mental and sexual abuse, threats of death, and sexual exploitation.

Speaking about the matter, Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia said, “This time, all parties are welcome to join our protest, whether BJP, Congress, AAP, or any other party. We are not affiliated with any party.” He added that it is the flag of the country that is held high when the wrestlers win media and not of any party.

“We play and win for the country, not for any party. Not only one party but everyone congratulates us on our win. So, this time, we welcome all parties and countrymen to join our protest,” Punia added.

Talking about the protest, Punia said, “If today we don’t fight for the respect of our daughters and sisters, then we won’t be able to fight against anyone ever.”

It may be recalled that the wrestlers had initially launched a protest against the President of the Wrestling Federation of India Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh in January this year and again resumed their sit-in protest in Jantar Mantar in Delhi in April 2023. In these few months, in stark contrast to his initial stance of asking politicians to refrain from joining the protest saying that they do not want it to be politicised, wrestler Bajrang Punia has now urged political parties to join the protests.

Notably, on January 19, when Communist Party’s Brinda Karat reached the site where wrestlers had sat on a protest over accusations against the federation chief and several coaches of sexually harassing multiple athletes, Punia had asked her to step down from the stage and not to make the issue political. This time, in contrast, Punia has welcomed people from all political parties, be it the BJP, the Congress, or the Aam Aadmi Party, to join the protest.

Here is a timeline of the Indian wrestlers’ protest against WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh:

Three months ago on 18 January 2023, a controversy erupted between the president of the Wrestling Federation of India and some Indian wrestlers when the latter held a press conference and levelled an array of accusations against Singh and the federation, including money embezzlement, mental and sexual abuse, threats of death, and sexual exploitation.

The wrestlers demanded that the wrestling federation be dissolved and Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh resign and be sent to jail.

Following the protests in January, Brij Bhushan Singh rejected allegations of dictatorship and sexual harassment raised by wrestlers on 18th January 2023. Brij Bhushan Singh has said, “I am ready to face an FIR, or CBI inquiry and even face the highest legal authority in India. I will hang myself if the allegations are found to be true.”

On January 19, a group of elite wrestlers, including Ravi Dahiya, Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Babita Phogat conducted an over-three-hour-long meeting with union sports minister Anurag Thakur in an effort to resolve the issue, but it proved to be inconclusive.

The wrestlers continued to express their displeasure by holding press conferences. They demanded a meeting with PM Modi.

On January 20, the Olympic Association, headed by PT Usha, established a seven-member committee to look into the matter and investigate the charges. The panel, led by legendary boxer MC Mary Kom, also included some eminent athletes such as wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, archer Dola Banerjee and Indian Weightlifting Federation president and IOA treasurer Sahdev Yadav. Wrestlers once again met with Anurag Thakur for the second round of talks.

The WFI chief termed the demonstration the “dharna of Shaheen Bagh” and declared Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh wouldn’t step down from his position.

Following this, an Oversight Committee was formed by the government on January 23, with star boxer Mary Kom as its head. Yogeshwar Dutt, an Olympic medal-winning wrestler, former badminton player, and member of the Mission Olympic Cell, Rajesh Rajagopalan, a former CEO of the Target Olympic Podium Scheme, and Radhica Sreeman, a former executive director (teams) of the Sports Authority of India, are the other members of the Oversight Committee.

The committee was tasked with investigating the allegations levelled against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and a one-month deadline was also set.

The sports minister assured the wrestlers that justice would be delivered to them.

On January 21, the first round of protests was called off.

After almost 55 days into the controversy, last month, it was announced that the sports minister’s oversight committee would soon submit its report to the ministry, however, till now the findings of the committee have not been made public. A report by the Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar had then quoted sources as saying that the committee tasked with conducting an investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment levelled at the WFI president has not found evidence against him, however, OpIndia cannot confirm the authenticity of the information shared by Dainik Bhaskar.

On Sunday, April 23, several top Indian wrestlers including Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia, and Vinesh Phogat returned to Jantar Mantar in Delhi to protest against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

It is notable that a complaint has also been lodged at Connaught Place Police Station by several female wrestlers on Friday this week against Singh accusing him of sexual harassment. The Delhi Police has not yet registered an FIR in the matter.

A complaint has also been submitted to the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), taking to Twitter DCW chief Swati Maliwal informed that a notice has been issued to the police.

On Monday, the wrestlers, eventually, knocked the doors of the Supreme Court, seeking the registration of an FIR against the President of the Wrestling Federation of India Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh for allegedly sexually assaulting the women wrestlers.","On Monday, the wrestlers filed a writ petition seeking the registration of an FIR against the President of the Wrestling Federation of India Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh for allegedly sexually assaulting the women wrestlers.

The suspension came following the protest by the wrestlers against the wrestling federation and its president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

Tomar’s presence will be “detrimental to the development of this high-priority discipline,” the ministry stated in a letter shared by PTI.

The letter further said, “The Ministry has taken note of the reports about the functioning of the WFI, including the role of Shri Vinod Tomar, and, has reasons to believe that his continued presence will be detrimental to the development of this high-priority discipline.”

The ministry decided to suspend him “with immediate effect”, to ensure the proper functioning of WFI. In addition, the ministry has ordered the WFI to halt all ongoing activities with immediate effect, including the Ranking Tournament in Brij Bhushan’s hometown of Gonda, Uttar Pradesh.

In a statement to ANI, earlier on Saturday, Tomar claimed that the wrestlers who staged a dharna at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar, and accused the WFI president of financial irregularities and sexual harassment, had not provided any proof to back up their claims.

The suspended WFI official said that when ANI approached him to seek his response to the development, that is how he learned of it. He denied receiving any information regarding his removal.

Tomar was removed a day after Anurag Thakur, the Union Minister of Sports, announced the creation of an oversight committee to look into the accusations made against Brij Bhushan and his organization by some of the best wrestlers in the nation, including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, and Ravi Dahiya. The committee will have the authority to decide on any issues relating to Indian wrestling and will also be in charge of managing the federation’s daily operations.

In a press release, the ministry said it has communicated to WFI that in view of the Government’s decision to appoint an Oversight Committee to investigate the various allegations raised by athletes, WFI will suspend all ongoing activities with immediate effect.

It added, “In view of the direction to suspend all activities immediately, the Sports Ministry has asked WFI to also cancel the ongoing Ranking Tournament in Gonda, UP.” In this connection, the ministry has additionally directed WFI to refund the entry fees that were collected from the attendees for the ongoing event.

Earlier, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh had received a deadline from the Ministry of Sports on Thursday, January 19, to resign from his position, after protesting wrestlers met Sports Minister Anurag Thakur at his home. The wrestlers decided to terminate their protest after the Sports Ministry promised to take measures and conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations.

The Indian Olympic Association has established a seven-member committee under the leadership of M C Mary Kom to look into the allegations against Brij Bhushan before the wrestlers decided to end their protest.

We will protest till the culprits are punished. No athlete will participate in any event.”

Vinesh Phogat accused Brij Bhushan Singh of sexual harassment. She also complained about the coaching staff. She said, “Coaches sexually harass wrestlers. I raised my voice against this. Brij Bhushan Singh also sexually harasses women wrestlers.”

Vinesh Phogat said that no one takes responsibility when injured. She also said that the president talks about not playing on the national level. She said crying, “After the Tokyo Olympics defeat, the WFI president called me a ‘Khota Sikka’ (false coin, meaning non-reliable player). The WFI tortured me mentally. I used to think about ending my life every day. If something happens to a wrestler, the responsibility will be on the WFI president.”

The national president of the Wrestling Federation of India Brij Bhushan Singh has rejected allegations of dictatorship and sexual harassment raised by wrestlers on 18th January 2023. Brij Bhushan Singh has said, “I am ready to face an FIR, or CBI inquiry and even face the highest legal authority in India. I will hang myself if the allegations are found to be true.”

Reportedly, Brij Bhushan Singh is likely to resign on January 22nd at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Wrestling Federation of India.","On Thursday, January 19, the Ministry of Sports has reportedly given an ultimatum to the Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to tender his resignation from the post.
The protesting wrestlers have demanded Brij Bhushan Singh’s resignation as well as urged the Ministry to dissolve the wrestling federation.

The wrestlers staged a protest at Jantar Mantar against him, and demanded his removal from the post.

The wrestlers said that they will fight this battle till the end and will not sit silently until Brij Bhushan Singh is removed from the post. Brij Bhushan Singh is also a BJP MP from the Kaiserganj seat in Uttar Pradesh.

Among the athletes who have at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar are 30 wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh, Rio Olympics medallist Sakshi Malik, world championship medallist Sarita Mor, Sangeeta Phogat, Satyavrat Malik, Jitendra Kinha and Commonwealth Games medallist Sumit Malik.

The wrestlers said that they are opposing some policies of the Wrestler Federation of India. Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, and Vinesh Phogat addressed a press conference during the protest. The wrestlers protesting at Jantar Mantar said that ever since they raised their voices, they have been threatened. They said, “We have all the wrestlers here today. What is being done to us will not be allowed to happen further. The mental harassment that is being done will not be allowed to happen.”

Bajrang Punia has accused the president of the Wrestling Federation of using abusive words and abusing him. He said, “We are here to play. He is specifically targeting the players and the state. We are being mentally tortured by the federation. The rules are made by the federation just one day in advance. The president is playing the entire role. The president abuses us. He even slapped the players.”

Bajrang Punia added, “Wrestlers do not want to tolerate this dictatorship. We want a change in the management of the Wrestling Federation of India. We hope the Prime Minister and the Home Minister will support us.

Vinesh Phogat accused the President of the Wrestling Federation of India of sexual harassment. She also complained about the coaching staff. She said, “Coaches sexually harass wrestlers. I raised my voice against this. Brij Bhushan Singh also sexually harasses women wrestlers.”

Vinesh Phogat said that no one takes responsibility when injured. She also said that the president talks about not playing on the national level.

I used to think about ending my life every day. If something happens to a wrestler, the responsibility will be on the WFI president.”

Vinesh Phogat added, “They (the federation) also interfere in our personal lives and harass us. They are exploiting us. When we went to the Olympics, we didn’t have a physio or a coach. Coaches are harassing women wrestlers and some of the federation’s favorite coaches also misbehave with women coaches. The WFI president sexually assaulted several girls.”","We want a change in the management of the Wrestling Federation of India.

As per ANI, the farmers were being escorted by the police to Jantar Mantar; however, without caution, the cohort of farmers broke past the barricades to join the protesters’ group.

The Delhi Police has further issued calls for appeal to abide by law and cooperate as the forces continue to facilitate entry for protesters.

Notably, the farmer unions, known for their protests in 2021 against the farm laws, had announced support for the protesting wrestlers recently through their spokesperson Rakesh Tikait.

The protesting farmers, including large groups of women are reported to have poured in groups of vehicles from Punjab and Haryana, to express solidarity with the wrestlers protesting at the site.

The Delhi Police has heightened security arrangements at the Jantar Mantar and in border areas of the city. Vehicles entering Delhi are being checked and pickets have been increased at Delhi-Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu borders.

BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), the collective active during farmers’ protests of 2021, and led by the communist leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan, has also announced support for the wrestlers and joined the protesters.

Interestingly, amidst the support pouring in for the protesting wrestlers from the opposition parties and farmer unions, top wrestler Bajrang Punia had issued calls to not politicise their protest and its cause.

However, with the agitation gaining a character increasingly like the ‘farmers’ agitation’, not to mention the involvement of leaders from a particular community of Haryana, Punjab and Western UP, some say that the protest is actively becoming an anti-government platform.

While the protesters claim lack of action against Brij Bhushan Singh due to no arrest so far, the Delhi Police has already registered two FIRs against the WFI president.

The protesting wrestlers have set a 21 May deadline to the Centre for accepting their demands.

At the venue, she expressed solidarity with the cause of the protestors.

Notably, on 27 April, in a meeting of an ad-hoc committee to overview the administration of WFI, PT Usha had stated to the media with reference to the protests – “This kind of agitation is not good for the country’s image and amounts to indiscipline. This negative publicity is not good for the country. We want to be with any athlete who has represented India, but under the rules, regulations, and law of the land.”

While this statement of hers had drawn flak from the protesting wrestlers who said they felt let down, Usha herself visited the protest site and spoke to the top wrestlers yesterday.

“Initially, when she said that, we felt very bad but then she said that her comments were misinterpreted. She said that she is first an athlete and then an administrator and that she is with us,” said Bajrang Punia , the Olympic wrestler, on PT Usha’s visit to the site.

Wednesday, 3 May’s night saw reports of a police scuffle at the protest site.

However, before this, a video did the rounds on social media which showed Usha being heckled at the protests site. A video of the wrestling site showed a woman waving a finger at the face of Usha and speaking in a harsh tone to the IOA president. Following this, Usha was taken away from the site with police escort.

Reports have now emerged which claim that the woman in the video is one Sudesh Goyat. According to this report , Goyat has been involved with more than one protest. Notably, the report credits Goyat with inspiring women in rural Haryana to take part in the ‘farmers protest’ of 2021.

Readers may be reminded that by January 2021 the 'farmers protest' was seeing participation of organisations and people that were seen a threat to national security.

Goyat has been regularly seen with the wrestlers in their current round of demonstrations.

The wrestlers’ protests alleging sexual misconduct against WFI president Brij Bhushan Singh began in January this year. The Sports Ministry has then announced the formation of a five-member oversight panel, led by Mary Kom, to investigate the allegations.","Days after condemning the ongoing wrestlers’ protests for indiscipline and tarnishing the image of the country, famed athlete, Rajya Sabha MP, and Indian Olympic Association President PT Usha visited the protest site at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday, 3 May.

Wrestlers from the states of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, and western parts of Uttar Pradesh were among those participating.

On the third day of the protest, posts that seemingly sought to represent the demonstration as a conspiracy by ""Jatt"" wrestlers against ""Thakur"" dominance in the WFI started doing the rounds on social media.

Allegations On The WFI President

Woman wrestler, Vinesh Phogat, flanked by Olympic medalists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik alleged sexual harassment of junior female wrestlers by the WFI Chairman and BJP MP, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

A memorandum submitted to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) by a group of protesting wrestlers, stated that Vinesh Phogat was subjected to mental torture by the WFI President, to the point that she considered taking her own life.

Singh has been on the post since 2011.

Brij Bhushan Singh's Declining Influence

Once considered among the top Thakur leaders in Uttar Pradesh, Singh has appeared to lose his influence in the last few years.

He is a five time-MP, with his first foray in 1991 on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket. Singh joined the Samajwadi Party (SP) in 2008 and even got elected on an SP ticket in 2009 from Kaiserganj constituency. He again jumped the ship to join the BJP in 2014. He fought again in 2019 from Kaiserganj and won.

However, the sway he had once enjoyed within the party, seems to be waning of late. In 2021, he openly criticised his own party's government in the state and charged it for not doing enough to prepare for floods. He alleged that speaking out would lead to being labeled a dissident.

His hostile attitude suggested that he had fallen out of favour with the Yogi government.

Swift Response By Sports Ministry

With the current controversy erupting, Bhushan found it difficult to continue his reign as the head of the WFI.

In response to the demonstration by top Indian wrestlers, the government has taken swift action. Following discussions with the protesters, it announced the suspension of all ongoing activities, including the Ranking Tournament in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, which is a stronghold of the federation president.

On Sunday (22 January), the Sports Ministry, led by Anurag Thakur, suspended WFI Assistant Secretary Vinod Tomar and called for Singh to resign within 24 hours.

Manufacturing Caste Angle

The government's actions seem to have come in time to prevent the issue from taking on a 'caste dimension'.

Singh belongs to the Thakur community. After the controversy broke out, some Twitter accounts had attempted to frame the wrestlers' demands as a ""Jatt vs Thakur"" conflict.

A campaign with hashtag 'Stand with Singh' was also started in support of the former WFI President. This portrayed him as a victim of caste politics.

Trying to turn the protest into a 'caste conflict' could be an attempt to undermine the genuine concerns of the Indian wrestlers.

There were also reports of Haryana's Khap panchayats joining the protest. That could have further inflamed the situation and potentially done more harm than good for the cause.

Wrestlers Keeping Politics Out

The wrestlers, however, have so far successfully avoided any political or casteist association with their protest. Athletes like Bajrang Punia have made appeals to refrain from politicising the issue and have expressed trust in the government to address their concerns.

They have also actively prevented political figures, such as Brinda Karat, from using the protest as a platform for their own motives.

For now, the wrestlers assured by the government response have called off their agitation.

A five member Oversight Committee has also been constituted to investigate sexual harassment charges against the WFI president.

MC Mary Kom, a renowned boxer, will head the committee, which will also manage the WFI's daily operations for the next month.

Other members of the panel include Olympic medallist wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former badminton player and Mission Olympic Cell member Trupti Murgunde, ex-TOPS CEO Rajagopalan, and former SAI executive director - teams - Radhika Sreeman.

The bench comprising of CJI DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narsimha and Justice J B Pardiwala decided to close the case after noting that it was filed seeking registration of an FIR against the WFI President over the allegations, and the same has been done by the Delhi Police.

Further, the three-judge bench granted liberty to the petitioners in case of any other grievances, to approach the jurisdictional magistrate or invoke the remedy under Section 482 CrPC before the Delhi High Court.

Senior Advocate Narender Hooda, appearing for the petitioner wrestlers’, pleaded before the bench to monitor the investigation on the consideration that the Delhi Police had taken no action or registered FIR until the intervention of the Supreme Court.

However, the court refused the same, referring to the liberty available to the petitioners to seek further remedies before other jurisdictional forums as directed.

Notably, the seven complainants in the case, which includes a minor, had approached the Delhi Police with the complaint on 21 April, and the FIRs were lodged only after April 28 once the petition had been filed before the Supreme Court.

Two FIRs were registered against Brij Bhushan Singh by the Delhi Police, one under the POCSO Act on allegations of a minor wrestler and the second, based on the complaints of other women wrestlers.
