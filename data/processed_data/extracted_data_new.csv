Bank stocks were among the worst affected as Nifty Bank lost over 1,300 points or 3.1%. PSU bank stocks, which were outperforming in the last few months, were among the worst hit with losses going up to 7% as investors were worried about the contagion impact of exposure to Adani Group.

In 1937, a hydrogen-powered German airship flying into New Jersey caught fire and crashed, killing 35 passengers on board. It was sort of a man-made disaster as some 100 people were loaded on to a balloon filled with the most flammable material in the universe. The airship was named Hindenburg. Eight decades later, in 2017, a graduate of international business management from the University of Connecticut founded a ""forensic financial research"" firm to specialise in spotting wrongdoings and frauds, or what it calls man-made disasters, at companies around the globe and take market bets against them. Founder Nathan (Nate) Anderson named his firm Hindenburg Research.Last week, a report from Hindenburg Research on Indian tycoon Gautam Adani 's business empire sparked a USD 51 billion sell-off in shares of his group companies, pushing him four places down on the world billionaire index The report said that the Adani Group had ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"". The disclosure came just ahead of Adani Enterprises ' Rs 20,000 crore open offer of shares to investors.Adani group has since rubbished the report as a ""malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations"". That, however, hasn't stopped investors from selling off.On Friday, shares of Adani Group companies continued their loosing streak for the second day with Adani Enterprises dropping a massive 18.5 per cent and Adani Ports & SEZ 16 per cent, taking the broader benchmark index -- the Sensex - down by 874.16 points or 1.45 per cent.Hindenburg engages in activist short selling, which involves selling borrowed stocks in hopes of buying at a lower price later. If prices fall expectedly, short sellers make a killing.Hindenburg, which invests its own capital, takes such bets based on its research, which looks for ""man-made disasters"" such as accounting irregularities, mismanagement and undisclosed related-party transactions.It especially looks for ""accounting irregularities; bad actors in management or key service provider roles; undisclosed related-party transactions; illegal/unethical business or financial reporting practices; and undisclosed regulatory, product, or financial issues"" in companies.""While we use fundamental analysis to aid our investment decision-making, we believe the most impactful research results from uncovering hard-to-find information from atypical sources,"" the company website says.Hindenburg's past targets include Lordstown Motors Corp (US), Kandi (China), Nikola Motor Company (US), Clover Health (US) and Tecnoglass (Colombia).Short sellers, however, aren't admired by most. Companies targeted by the activists have been pushing regulators to go after these short sellers as they may be indulging in some sort of insider trading. Supporters, however, say that the research actually uncover frauds and do more good than harm to investors.Not much is known about the company, besides its 38-year-old founder Anderson, who lived in Jerusalem, Israel before returning to the US where he first took up a consulting job with a financial data company FactSet and then worked at broker dealer firms in Washington DC and New York.Before he founded Hindenburg, Anderson worked with Harry Markopolos, who had flagged Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, to investigate Platinum Partners, a hedge fund that was eventually charged with fraud worth USD 1 billion.While living in Jerusalem, Anderson volunteered for a local ambulance service.Hindenburg is best known for its bet against electric truck maker Nikola Corp in September 2020 for its ""alleged lies and deceptions"" in years leading up to its proposed partnership with General Motors.Among dozens of other issues, it challenged a promotional video Nikola produced showing its electric truck cruising at high speed. This it said was nothing more than a truck being rolled down a hill in the Utah desert, a claim the company later admitted and its founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton resigning.Nikola, which agreed in 2021 to pay USD 125 million to settle a case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, listed in June 2020 and its valuation touched USD 34 billion at peak but is now worth USD 1.34 billion.Hindenburg's website lists over a dozen companies where it has flagged alleged wrongdoings. These include WINS Finance, which Hindenburg revealed had failed to disclose to US investors an RMB 350 million asset freeze imposed on one of its subsidiaries in China; the ""zombie company"" China Metal Resources Utilization which had a ""100 per cent downside"" and was ""under severe financial distress"" with ""numerous accounting irregularities''; SC Worx's ""completely bogus"" Covid-19 testing deal; ""massive undisclosed related party transactions, including a USD 509 million merger"" at HF Foods; ""billions of dollars in undisclosed off-balance sheet liabilities"" of Bloom Energy; and a whistleblower report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ""relating to RD Legal, a hedge fund that was later charged by the commission for allegedly making material misstatements to its investors"".Almost all of Hindenburg's work has been followed up by legal or regulatory action, according to its website.To take a short position, investors sell borrowed stock in hopes of buying it back at a lower price later. If prices fall expectedly, they make a killing. If the price rises instead, they would have to buy stock to 'cover' what they borrowed.Short sellers however aren't admired by most.

All the listed stocks of the group took a beating after the report.Adani Enterprises closed 1.54 per cent lower on Wednesday while Adani Ports & SEZ ended 6.3 per cent down.After the report came out, Adani Group had stated that it was shocked to see the report that was published without any attempt to contact it to get the factual matrix.""The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India's highest courts,"" the ports-to-energy conglomerate had said in a statement.It had gone on to question the timing of the report, saying its publication ahead of the FPO ""clearly betrays a brazen, malafide intention to undermine Adani Group's reputation with the principal objective of damaging"" the issue.""Gautam Adani, founder and chairman of Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly USD 120 billion, adding over USD 100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group's seven key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819 per cent in that period,"" the US researcher's report had said.The Hindenburg's report details a web of Adani-family controlled offshore shell entities in tax havens spanning the Caribbean and Mauritius to the United Arab Emirates, which it claims were used to facilitate corruption, money laundering and taxpayer theft, while siphoning off money from the group's listed companies.""Our research involved speaking with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of Adani Group, reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries,"" it said. Hindenburg claimed to have uncovered ""rudimentary efforts seemingly designed to mask the nature of some of the shell entities.""""Even if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85 per cent downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations,"" the report said adding key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing.Adani Group has repeatedly dismissed debt concerns. Its Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh on January 21 on a media call stated that ""Nobody has raised debt concerns to us.

Adani Group has dismissed the report as baseless and said it is considering whether to take legal action against the New York-based firm. The conglomerate termed the report on the group ‘malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale’ and is exploring legal action against the US investor on its report alleging ‘brazen’ market manipulation and accounting fraud by Asia’s richest man’s empire.

In a statement later on Twitter, Hindenburg said it fully stands by its report and would in fact welcome any legal action by Adani group. “If Adani is serious, it should also file suit in the U.S. where we operate. We have a long list of documents we would demand in a legal discovery process,"" the statement posted on Twitter read.

The Adani Group has been diversifying its business interests and last year bought cement firms ACC and Ambuja Cements from Switzerland's Holcim for $10.5 billion. ACC was down 15% on Friday, while Ambuja plunged up to 25%.

The most-liquid stocks controlled by the Adani Group, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd and Ambuja Cements, are also the most vulnerable in the event of an extended selloff in the diversified conglomerate’s shares, as per Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Nitin Chanduka.

Adani Group had announced the acquisition of Holcim's stake in Ambuja (63.19%) and stake in ACC (4.48%; Ambuja directly owns around 50% stake in ACC). Adani Group's open offer for a 26% stake each in Ambuja/ACC ended on September 9, 2022.

Adani Enterprises shares lost more than 19% on Friday, sliding below the ₹3,276 level at which anchor investors were allotted shares in the follow-on equity sale. Adani Transmission shares tumbled over 19% and Adani Total Gas sank 19.1% in their biggest daily drop since mid-March 2020, while Adani Green Energy sank about 16% on the BSE.

“It is the investor’s choice. We will not try and influence that. We definitely think there is merit in the group and we think the longer term prospects remain very robust. One cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt. I would definitely advocate a buy at least in the FPO and I would say Ambuja and the ports are looking very attractive at this price,” says, Director,Well that is a million dollar question. One report from five analysts who I have never heard of, Hindenburg comes and upsets the market. They come on the expiry day and tell them that they are short. It is all concerted. Whatever the outcome, it tells us how insider trading is very open right now. In fact, SEBI and stock exchanges should look to who had initiated this and where was the call writing and put and hence the option market.On Wednesday, out of a turnover of Rs 400 lakh crore, Rs 300 lakh crore was just the option. But on a more neutral note, the group has very good assets and there is no sovereign risk over here. LIC , the other banks, which I see no problem with. There is always going to be uncertainty when a group has made its market cap past Rs 20 lakh crore in the last five years but it is on the back of businesses which are there. So the debate is open.In a global context, India has underperformed this month and now is time to put your money where your mouth is. I do not see any changes coming on the LTCG on the negative side and if anything, there can be more proponents on capex and other things because the government is sitting on a much better balance sheet than before. I would say this is the lull before the storm of buying what you want because what the money had to go to China has already gone. I would definitely give Adani a subscribe over here. A disclosure, we have no holdings in Adani.Look at the top gainers – Bajaj Auto Tata Motors , Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero. The numbers from the auto side are excellent. When an economy turns, the first two sectors to turn are cement and auto and there are no two ways. I think Ambuja is a steal at this price.Aside from that, the holding company Adani Enterprise and Adani Ports. Adani Ports would be arguably the third best port in the world. So ignoring the corporate issues and the debt, we all know there are no such hidden things. Every six months something comes up like that and one can see the prerogative is the derailing the FPO.There are pros and cons but this is very well orchestrated where the option side is telling you that insiders had already taken position and perpetrated its report. The outcome of that is the market for you. But I definitely think cement, autos are telling you that the economy has turned and if anything, the Budget could be a trend setter and this is a very good time to buy select stocks definitely.Where have you seen 30% falls in two days? Now whether it is perpetrated or not, there are sovereign funds, there are enough people who have committed to the FPO. So it is a needle where you have to see whether you can ignore the noise and put your money in something which is giving you value, but it is the investor’s choice. We will not try and influence that. We definitely think there is merit in the group and we think the longer term prospects remain very robust. You cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt. Also, I think all their businesses are in fine shape.

The situation is even more worrying for those who have only a single source of income. Hence, amid these times of volatility, people are in search of lucrative investment plans that can guarantee them a regular and a fixed monthly income.

Most of the people are aware of the post office monthly income scheme which recently revised the interest rates for the scheme from January 2023. The investors are now getting 7.1 per cent per annum payable monthly.

However, today we will discuss another monthly income scheme provided by the largest public sector bank, State Bank of India (SBI).

One such investment plan offered by SBI is the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme which offers guaranteed returns, providing investors with assurance and the peace of mind they deserve.

Understanding SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme

In the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme, investors have to deposit one-time lump sum amount. After investment, investors receive re-payment of the same in monthly annuity installment comprising part of the principal amount plus interest on the reducing principal amount, compounded at quarterly rests and discounted to the monthly value.

In simpler terms, SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme allows investors to receive a predetermined monthly amount in return for their initial deposit in Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs). So, it works on the concept of a loan. Bank provides you the loan where you repay it along with the interest on the loan in EMIs. Similarly, in an annuity deposit scheme you give a certain amount to the bank and it repays you with interest on the invested amount.

SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme: Duration of the investment scheme

Customers of SBI can take advantage of the SBI Annuity Deposit scheme for a deposit period of 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. The scheme is available at all branches of the SBI.

SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme Eligibility

All resident individuals, including minors can invest in the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme while the mode of holding can be done singly or jointly.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Rules for Premature closure

The bank allows the premature closure for the SBI Annuity scheme depositors in case of death of the subscriber. Premature payment is also allowed for deposits up to Rs 15 lakh, however, penalty is chargeable as applicable to Term Deposits.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Facility for Loan

The scheme allows an overdraft or loan up to 75% of the annuity balance in certain circumstances.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Tax

Interest on SBI Annuity Deposits scheme is subject to TDS.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Maturity amount

In the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme, investors receive re-payment of their invested amount in monthly annuity installment comprising part of the principal amount plus interest on the reducing principal amount. So, the maturity amount is zero.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Interest rates

The interest rates provided on the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme are as applicable to term deposits chosen by the account holder.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Payment date to customers by bank

Investors will start receiving the returns starting the first month's anniversary, if the date (29th, 30th, or 31st) is non-existent, the lender will make the repayment on the first day of the following month.

Annuity deposit scheme vs Fixed Deposit

In Fixed Deposit account, customers make one time Deposit and receive the maturity amount at maturity date which comprises principal and interest. Annuity Deposit accepts one time Deposit and amount is repaid to the customer over the pre-decided tenure selected by the investor, along with interest, in equated monthly installments. In FD, the investor's principal amount remains intact which is repaid after maturity, however, in SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme the invested amount is paid in full along with the interest by the bank during the pre-decided duration.

Annuity deposit scheme vs Post office MIS

The only difference between the two is that in the post office monthly income scheme, the investor gets the full invested amount after maturity, which is not the case in SBI Annuity Deposit scheme.","Understanding SBI Annuity Deposit SchemeIn the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme, investors have to deposit one-time lump sum amount.

It was a bloodbath on Friday, with Adani stocks hitting lower circuits and some of them even witnessing a double-digit decline. The reason behind the free fall in Adani stocks would be Hindenburg Research's allegations over the Group. However, Adani has fought back by giving a much clear picture of its business portfolio.

On Friday, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas closed at 20% lower circuits each. While Adani Power and Adani Wilmar hit 5% lower circuits each. Adani Ports wasn't performing any better and tumbled by over 16% at the end of the day.

Meanwhile, Adani's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, which launched its FPO on Friday, nosedived by around 20% before closing at ₹2,762.15 apiece on BSE.

The first day of the FPO saw muted demand across investors.

Under the ₹20,000 crore worth FPO, on Friday, only 4,70,160 equity shares were bid against the offered size of 4,55,06,791 equity shares. The price band for the FPO is set from ₹3,112 to ₹3,276 per FPO equity share for all categories of investors.

If Adani's FPO is fully subscribed, then this will become the second largest follow-on public offer in India after Coal India's ₹22,558 crore issue in 2015. Earlier in 2020, Yes Bank had launched a ₹15,000 crore FPO.

But circumstances changed drastically a few days before Adani's FPO and it would be Hindenburg Research's report under which it accused Adani of stock manipulation and fraud schemes.

In its report on January 24, the New York-based investment research firm said, ""we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the ₹17.8 trillion ($218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.""

Hindenburg's report indicated that Gautam Adani, Founder, and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group’s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.

The findings of Hindenburg's research report on Adani involved interactions with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of Adani and also reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.

Also, the research said, even ""if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.""

Adani companies' debt was also among the key factors that Hindenburg pointed out.

It said, key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported ‘current ratios’ below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.

Hindenburg's research note came as a shock and Adani stocks went into frenzied selling.

Although, Adani has denied Hindenburg's accusations.

On January 27th, Adani Enterprises filed a presentation covering Adani Group’s response to Hindenburg Report. It was titled ""Myths of Short Seller"".

Hindenburg is the short seller.

According to Adani's presentation, Hindenburg asked 89 questions in total. While some of these questions are in regards to the group's related party transactions, DRI (Directorate of Revenue Intelligence), and court cases. However, there are 21 questions in total that cannot be claimed to be the result of any investigation over a 2-year period or any such assertion as they were disclosed in public documents all the way back from 2015 onwards.

Further, Adani said, 8 of 9 listed companies have a big 6 auditor such as Deloitte Haskins & Sells, SRBC & Co. (EY), SRBC & Co. (EY) & Dharmesh Parikh & Co. (Joint Auditors), Shah Dhandharia & Co., Ernst & Young, PKF, Walker Chandiok & Co. and K S Rao & Co., etc.

Moreover, on the leverage issue, Adani mentioned 100 of its various companies are rated ( these account for nearly 100% of its EBITDA). Also, in regards to revenue or balance sheet being artificially inflated or managed, it said, out of 9 listed companies in Adani portfolio — 6 are subject to specific sector regulatory review for revenue, costs, and capex.

Meanwhile, in terms of governance, 4 of Adani's large companies are in the top 7% of the peer group in Emerging markets or the sector or the world. On LAS position, Adani said, overall promoter leverage is less than 4% of promoter holding.

Earlier, on January 25, Jugeshinder Singh, Group CFO, Adani said, ""We are shocked that Hindenburg Research has published a report on 24 January 2023 without making any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix. The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless, and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts.""

""The timing of the report’s publication clearly betrays a brazen, mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group’s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming Follow-on Public Offering from Adani Enterprises, the biggest FPO ever in India,"" Singh added.

Also, on January 26, Jatin Jalundhwala, Group Head - Legal, Adani said, ""the maliciously mischievous, unresearched report published by Hindenburg Research on 24 Jan 2023 has adversely affected the Adani Group, our shareholders, and investors. The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens.""

Nevertheless, the panic selloffs in these seven stocks have led to a massive correction in Gautam Adani's net worth. Asia's richest man's wealth is to the tune of $92.7 billion as of January 28. As per Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Adani's net worth has dropped by $20.8 billion at the latest. However, year-to-date, Adani's wealth has dipped by $27.9 billion.","On Friday, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas closed at 20% lower circuits each.

In 1937, a hydrogen-powered German airship flying into New Jersey caught fire and crashed, killing 35 passengers on board. It was sort of a man-made disaster as some 100 people were loaded on to a balloon filled with the most flammable material in the universe. The airship was named Hindenburg. Eight decades later, in 2017, a graduate of international business management from the University of Connecticut founded a ""forensic financial research"" firm to specialise in spotting wrongdoings and frauds, or what it calls man-made disasters, at companies around the globe and take market bets against them. Founder Nathan (Nate) Anderson named his firm Hindenburg Research.Last week, a report from Hindenburg Research on Indian tycoon Gautam Adani 's business empire sparked a USD 51 billion sell-off in shares of his group companies, pushing him four places down on the world billionaire index The report said that the Adani Group had ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"". The disclosure came just ahead of Adani Enterprises ' Rs 20,000 crore open offer of shares to investors.Adani group has since rubbished the report as a ""malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations"". That, however, hasn't stopped investors from selling off.On Friday, shares of Adani Group companies continued their loosing streak for the second day with Adani Enterprises dropping a massive 18.5 per cent and Adani Ports & SEZ 16 per cent, taking the broader benchmark index -- the Sensex - down by 874.16 points or 1.45 per cent.Hindenburg engages in activist short selling, which involves selling borrowed stocks in hopes of buying at a lower price later. If prices fall expectedly, short sellers make a killing.Hindenburg, which invests its own capital, takes such bets based on its research, which looks for ""man-made disasters"" such as accounting irregularities, mismanagement and undisclosed related-party transactions.It especially looks for ""accounting irregularities; bad actors in management or key service provider roles; undisclosed related-party transactions; illegal/unethical business or financial reporting practices; and undisclosed regulatory, product, or financial issues"" in companies.""While we use fundamental analysis to aid our investment decision-making, we believe the most impactful research results from uncovering hard-to-find information from atypical sources,"" the company website says.Hindenburg's past targets include Lordstown Motors Corp (US), Kandi (China), Nikola Motor Company (US), Clover Health (US) and Tecnoglass (Colombia).Short sellers, however, aren't admired by most. Companies targeted by the activists have been pushing regulators to go after these short sellers as they may be indulging in some sort of insider trading. Supporters, however, say that the research actually uncover frauds and do more good than harm to investors.Not much is known about the company, besides its 38-year-old founder Anderson, who lived in Jerusalem, Israel before returning to the US where he first took up a consulting job with a financial data company FactSet and then worked at broker dealer firms in Washington DC and New York.Before he founded Hindenburg, Anderson worked with Harry Markopolos, who had flagged Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, to investigate Platinum Partners, a hedge fund that was eventually charged with fraud worth USD 1 billion.While living in Jerusalem, Anderson volunteered for a local ambulance service.Hindenburg is best known for its bet against electric truck maker Nikola Corp in September 2020 for its ""alleged lies and deceptions"" in years leading up to its proposed partnership with General Motors.Among dozens of other issues, it challenged a promotional video Nikola produced showing its electric truck cruising at high speed. This it said was nothing more than a truck being rolled down a hill in the Utah desert, a claim the company later admitted and its founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton resigning.Nikola, which agreed in 2021 to pay USD 125 million to settle a case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, listed in June 2020 and its valuation touched USD 34 billion at peak but is now worth USD 1.34 billion.Hindenburg's website lists over a dozen companies where it has flagged alleged wrongdoings. These include WINS Finance, which Hindenburg revealed had failed to disclose to US investors an RMB 350 million asset freeze imposed on one of its subsidiaries in China; the ""zombie company"" China Metal Resources Utilization which had a ""100 per cent downside"" and was ""under severe financial distress"" with ""numerous accounting irregularities''; SC Worx's ""completely bogus"" Covid-19 testing deal; ""massive undisclosed related party transactions, including a USD 509 million merger"" at HF Foods; ""billions of dollars in undisclosed off-balance sheet liabilities"" of Bloom Energy; and a whistleblower report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ""relating to RD Legal, a hedge fund that was later charged by the commission for allegedly making material misstatements to its investors"".Almost all of Hindenburg's work has been followed up by legal or regulatory action, according to its website.To take a short position, investors sell borrowed stock in hopes of buying it back at a lower price later. If prices fall expectedly, they make a killing. If the price rises instead, they would have to buy stock to 'cover' what they borrowed.Short sellers however aren't admired by most.

Opposition leaders across party lines on Saturday raised concerns about the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India and the State Bank of India’s (SBI) exposure to the Adani group, questioning the Union government’s silence on the issue.

On January 25, New York-based investor research firm, Hindenburg Research, had accused the Adani group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud”. Rejecting the charge, the ports-to-power conglomerate said that the allegations were “malicious, unsubstantiated, one-sided”. The report was timed to spoil the public listing of its shares in the capital markets, the Adani group claimed.

In a series of tweets, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Randeep Surjewala used publicly available data to show the dip in market capitalisation of government-controlled financial institutions due to the falling value of Adani shares. Noting that LIC was funded by “public money”, Mr. Surjewala said that the value of LIC’s investment in Adani Group shares had fallen from ₹77,000 crore to ₹53,000 crore, resulting in a loss of ₹23,500 crore, while LIC’s shares had lost ₹22,442 crore. He asked why LIC was still investing ₹300 crore in the Adani Group.

With regard to SBI, Mr. Surjewala noted that its market capitalisation had declined by a whopping ₹54,618 crore, adding that the banking sector’s loan exposure to the Adani group was ₹81,200 crore. Given this situation, he questioned why the SBI Employees Pension Fund and SBI Life were still investing ₹225 crore in the Adani Group.

‘Silence from the Centre’

The Congress leader also asked why Central agencies such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Enforcement Directorate, the Serious Frauds Investigation Office, and the Central Bureau of Investigation, as well as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, have all remained “mute”.

Priyanka Chaturvedi, deputy leader of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena faction in the Rajya Sabha, echoed his concerns. ”LIC saw 22% dip in its holdings in last two days, its share price fell 3.5% during the day and 5.3% over two days. This is Indian people’s hard earned savings which is being pumped in and sucked out. Hope SEBI and RBI are watching & acting,” she tweeted.

‘Banks will sink’

Trinamool Congress’ Rajya Sabha member Jawhar Sircar also tweeted, ”I know from 40 years in Government that LIC’s big investments need a nod from FM or PM. Don’t know why they’re out to destroy an excellent institution that caters to the middle class!”

“Swiss Credit Sights had warned long ago. Modi Government did not listen. Our banks will now sink — your money, my money will go down — while Adani goes away scot-free!” Mr. Sircar added.","On January 25, New York-based investor research firm, Hindenburg Research, had accused the Adani group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud”.

They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities -- public companies, nine we have now, are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in India. Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement,” says, Group CFO,I will answer the second part first. Have we seen the exit of any large shareholders? From the data that we have as of the week, the answer is no. A lot of large institutional investors are long-term strategic infra, intergenerational investors. They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities -- public companies, nine we have now, are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in India.Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement. Therefore we do not expect it and neither has there been any movement in the long-term strategic investors and positions.On the first part of the question – yes, we saw short-term volatility and the share prices have consequently changed but again because the fundamental business has not altered in any way, we believe that this volatility will pass. In a week's time, our quarterly results will come out and people will see that the group continues on its upward trend and therefore we believe that over a period of time, it will be seen that we are a core infra utilities platform and therefore on a weekly basis, our cash flows do not alter.So to give you an example here, every week on average, our portfolio makes about Rs 1,100 crore. This Sunday also, that number was achieved. Next Sunday it will be the same, the following Sunday it will be the same. We believe that it will become clear to investors that this short-term volatility will be addressed as we go through over the next few months.As correctly highlighted, even in this report, I could not find anything with assets and performance of our businesses. So, they talk about promoter level debt. We hardly borrow on a corporate basis. At promoter level also, we do not borrow much. At a promoter level, we are net lenders to the market. Therefore, on a corporate basis also, we do not have much debt. On a promoter basis, as I explained, we are net lenders. So it is a completely unsubstantiated speculation that we have huge amounts of debt at promoter level.We are one of the few groups that formally declare total pledge positions on a regular basis quarterly. It goes out as part of our credit report which goes to all investors or banking partners or shareholders, even independent directors. So the informed investor is very clear that we do not have this. This report to that extent is mere speculation on that point of debt.On other aspects, we will discuss but as we go through this period, it has to be recognised and I would like to clarify for the public that for our large companies, say Adani Transmission or Adani Port or Adani Green or Adani Total Gas , their credit profile is similar to that of the government sovereign companies. We are the highest rated infrastructure portfolio in the country with the exception of the Government of India. This has to be seen in that context. We are very comfortable with this and we believe that it is a completely unsubstantiated rumour mongering though it affects us temporarily.False.No, it is nothing to do. Our promoter shareholding is both for India and we hold some of our shares from overseas. In our Holcim transaction, when we issued an open offer document, the entire structure of our overseas holding was fully disclosed. Our domestic holding structure has been disclosed in public documents for investors for the past 12 years.Therefore for anything beyond that, we are fully disclosed in our offering documents for investors, for regulators and for everybody. It is mere speculation and we cannot answer to speculation because this holding structure from family trust, intermediate companies and companies that hold shares domestically, be it Dubai to Mauritius, is fully disclosed in a comprehensive manner. Therefore they have made speculative charges that we control or do not control some company.They raised a specific question. We have addressed this in our rebuttal to that report. Now this is a specific question they asked. They said that in relation to Carmichael Rail and I am aware of this because this is part of AEL, we transferred an asset to a private company and then the private company immediately wrote down the value of their asset. So their implication is we over inflated Adani Enterprise revenue by writing off the asset in a private company. Now this charge is of malicious nature and that is my media statement because I knew this at that point in time also.This is the malicious nature of this report which is borderline lying and it is certainly a misrepresentation. First, we actually disclosed these ourselves that this is a related party transaction. Then we disclosed fully how the transaction was done. Now if somebody claims to have done two years of research, they would have known that this asset when you are transferred, had its accounting treatment known in Adani Enterprise. They could have seen from the same note that in Adani Enterprise, we had already written down the value of the assets and charged it to the P&L as a loss. They knew this and yet they still published this question.I am assuming they know this because they claim to have done two years of research. Now if they did not know this, then it is just purely ignorant and malicious. If they have knowingly done this, it is a case of genuine falsehoods and misrepresentation. So this is a clear example which we have highlighted and we have made public in our response, which is well over 400 pages fully annotated and we have attached the documents so people can verify themselves that 68 out of 88 are these types of questions they have asked.We borrow very little at the promoter level and we declare it and therefore the coverage that we have in relation to that borrowing is we have cash to actually pay the borrowings full stop. Therefore it is completely baseless that there were margin costs. Before margin cost, we will just pay and borrow and completely retire the shareholder loss.The FPO is as you know is a three-part process and we deliberately selected the FPO because we wanted to make sure and achieve certain outcomes; broader institutional participation, broader analyst coverage and actually broader HNI and retail participation.In the current situation or due to the volatility on Friday, the FPO price is below the retail target price. So we expect retail participation. We will wait to see how it goes but the long term investors see the value of the Adani Enterprise differently and they are fully committed for the FPO and we have no information that that has changed.Therefore we are moving ahead because we believe that with our institutional and strategic investor base, the offer will anyway be fully subscribed. Now once and that is why we clarify….that the FPO is proceeding as normal and the reason the confidence comes is because of the way long-term investors look at AEL value. AEL value is not in the share price of AEL. It is just a holding value.The real value of AEL is in incubating assets like Adani Airports, Adani Data Centre business, Adani new industry green hydrogen business, Adani Roads, Adani Digital Labs, Adani Wilmar and mining services business. Those businesses are still performing as they are and they still have the same value. Now that value will be exercised when we demerge this business in the next four to six years.So long-term strategic investors is what they are aiming for and that value has not changed because that is not representative of the AEL. The AEL share price is not representative of that value fully, it is a discounted value. So long-term investors are comfortable with the underlying value. Retail investors will see some pull back but even some ultra HNI and HNI will participate.Correct. Our objective on the retail investor base is twofold; one, we want to spread out the share register which is our objective and which we expect to complete by 2025-2026. Now in the short term, naturally some change will happen because of the possible pullback of retail investors but it is very important for us to understand what we want to do for the retail investor.We are in infra and being an asset-based company, it is very important that the Indian public owns its own assets. It would be good for the person going to Mumbai airport to own some shares because it is their asset, it is the assets of India. Indian public must participate and we want to encourage that participation. It is a bit of a disappointment that there will be some pullback, but in the longer term, we believe our objective to continue to encourage Indian retail investors will pay dividends and the wealth creation that Indian investors, retail investors should enjoy from Indian assets will occur. That is one of the key objectives of our founder and that the public should participate in the wealth creation of hard real assets in the country.Yes, Gujarat Ambuja shares were never pledged and we had clarified at that time also that it was a representation based on the very technical definition that Sebi has; the shares are never pledged. The way the acquisition of that nature is accomplished is that we tell our bankers and debt capital providers that we will hold a minimum number of shares and not the value of shares.So we are not sellers of our equity and we said we will own 63% odd of Ambuja shares which we own. So it is not a loan against shares, not pledged in any way. It is a security package which is different from pledge but that is counted in encumbrance by SEBI and that is why there was some misunderstanding and people misreported that as pledge.It is not for us to give a discount. It is important for us that there is a value equation here and that is based on the sum of parts of real assets being developed. We very carefully evaluated the events of last week and the consensus feedback was that you please go ahead as planned and that is what we are doing.We are in a position where last week we made an EBITDA portfolio level of Rs 1,100 crore. Next week, it would be the same and the week after that, would be the same. We are a non-discretionary consumer spending portfolio. Therefore, underlying businesses are as they are – super high credit quality, massive cash flows and therefore underlying business even their growth trajectory is not impacted by this let alone anything else.","Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement,” says, Group CFO,I will answer the second part first.

Among the 44 MFs, SBI Mutual Fund had the highest exposure of ₹6,142 crore to the Group, with the biggest investment of ₹2,776 crore in Adani Enterprises, followed by ₹1,816 crore in Adani Ports & SEZ and ₹790 crore in Ambuja Cements.

Kotak Mahindra MF had an investment of ₹2,329 crore — ₹1,080 crore in Adani Ports & SEZ, and ₹661 crore and ₹495 crore in Ambuja Cements and Adani Enterprises, respectively.

ICICI MF had the highest investment of ₹693 crore, ₹506 crore and ₹382 crore in Adani Ports & SEZ, Ambuja Cements and ACC. Other mutual funds which have over ₹1,000 crore exposure to Adani Group companies include Axis MF, HDFC MF, Quant MF, Tata MF and UTI MF.

Among Adani group companies, Ambuja Cement and Adani Ports and SEZ attracted the maximum investment of ₹8,204 crore and ₹7,996 crore, respectively, from MFs. Their investments in Adani Enterprises and ACC amounted to ₹5,097 crore and ₹3,744 crore, respectively.

Mutual funds invested ₹557 crore and ₹395 crore in Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission.

Exposure of most of the mutual funds to Adani Group companies are through their passive and index funds.

The sharp fall in Adani Group company stocks in the last two days will not have any immediate impact on the net asset value of equity schemes as they account for less than two per cent of the equity asset under management of ₹15.25-lakh crore of the mutual fund industry.

After investor wealth of about ₹1-lakh crore was eroded on Wednesday, the selling pressure in stocks of Adani Group companies intensified with most them caught in lower circuit on Friday.

Adani Ports lost nearly 20 per cent to hit two-year low at ₹572, while Adani Transmission, Adani Green and Adani Total Gas also lost 20 per cent each. Adani’s two new acquisitions — ACC lost 15 per cent, while Ambuja Cements shares crashed up to 25 per cent.

Adani Group’s flagship company Adani Enterprises tumbled 10 per cent, while Adani Power, Adani Wilmar and NDTV hit the 5 per cent lower circuit.

Devarsh Vakil, Deputy Head Retail Research, HDFC Securities, said dragged by massive selling mainly in Adani group and banking stocks, the benchmark equity indices have hit their three-month low.

(With inputs from agencies)

Shares of Adani Group companies remained under pressure for the third straight session on Monday with majority of them witnessing a crash yet again.The deepening market rout has now led to losses worth $65 billion in the group's stock values, according to a Reuters report.The current round of fall follows a report by Hindenburg Research last week which flagged concerns about the conglomerates debt levels and the use of tax havens.On Monday, Adani Transmission dropped 14.91%, Adani Green by 20%, Adani Total Gas by 20%, Adani Power by 5%, and Adani Wilmar by 5%.However, shares of flagship Adani Enterprises climbed 4.21% after its follow on public offer (FPO) was subscribed 2%.The developments also had an impact on the stock market which remained volatile during the entire session. Benchmark BSE sensex gyrated nearly 1,000 points intra-day before staging a smart comeback in late trades on selective buying.Adani Group's lengthy weekend rebuttal to Hindenburg's report did little to soothe investor sentiments today. The 3-day selloff has now erased nearly $65 billion market value amid a share sale by Adani’s flagship that was meant to underline the tycoon’s ascension on the global stage.While the Adani Group has portrayed Hindenburg’s allegations as baseless and an attack against India itself, the latter’s report is reviving longstanding investor concerns about the conglomerate’s corporate governance.The saga also threatens to weaken broader confidence in India, until recently a top investment destination for Wall Street, and accelerate a nascent shift toward a reopening China.The selloff is also fast eroding the wealth of Adani, Asia’s richest man, after his stocks were some of the best performers last year not just in the local market, but also on the broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index.From being the 4th richest in the global billionaire rankings till Wednesday last week, Adani has now dropped to the 8th spot with a total net worth of $88.2 billion, as per the Forbes real time billionaires list. However, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows Adani at 7th spot with a wealth of $92.7 billion.This is in sharp contrast to September last year, when Adani's wealth had surged to over $155 billion, making him the 2nd richest person in global billionaires ranking and the first Indian (and Asian) to break into the top 3 list.In a little over two and half years, Gautam Adani 's wealth had galloped over 13 times. In January 2020 just before the onset of Covid pandemic, his net worth was about $10 billion.In 1988, Gautam Adani had set up Adani Enterprises (then Adani Exports) to start a commodities trading business. Soon he set up Mundra port for captive export-import operations. Within a decade it also emerged as the biggest coal trading company in the country and one of India's largest foreign exchange earners.The Adani group had on Sunday slammed the Hindenburg report and likened the damning allegations to a ""calculated attack"" on India, its institutions and growth story, saying the allegations are ""nothing but a lie"".""Needless to say that Hindenburg has created these questions to divert the attention of its target audience while managing its short trades to benefit at the cost of investors,"" the group said.The Gautam Adani-led group also said that the report is selective and manipulative presentation of matters already in public domain to caste a false narrative.They also claimed that the Hindenburg report is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities.Some 65 of the 88 questions posed by Hindenburg are based on Adani’s public disclosures and the conduct of the American short seller ""is nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law,"" Adani Group statement said.The group further reiterated that it will ""exercise rights to pursue remedies to safeguard our stakeholders before all appropriate authorities.""The Adani Group's response comes ahead of the final few days of a $2.5 billion share sale by Adani Enterprises, which received overall subscriptions of 1% on Friday.""Mala fide intention is apparent given its timing when Adani Enterprises is undertaking the largest equity FPO,"" the group stated.US short seller Hindenburg Research rejected Adani Group's charge that its report was an attack on India, saying a ""fraud"" cannot be obfuscated by nationalism or a bloated response that ignored response to key allegations.Commenting on the 413-page response, Hindenburg said it believed India was a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future and it was Adani Group which was holding it back through ""systematic loot"".Hindenburg stood by its last week's report that said its two-year investigation found Adani Group ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"".Hindenburg said the response by the conglomerate run by Asia's richest man Gautam Adani ""opened with the sensationalistic claim that we are the 'Madoffs of Manhattan'.""Hindenburg responded saying Adani Group ""predictably tried to lead the focus away from substantive issues and instead stoked a nationalist narrative.""""Adani Group has attempted to conflate its meteoric rise and the wealth of its chairman, Gautam Adani, with the success of India itself,"" it said.""We disagree.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Saturday said that it's committed to ensuring market integrity and structural strength.

The regulator also stated that all necessary surveillance measures are in place to address any excessive volatility in individual shares, according to the news agency PTI.

In an official statement, the watchdog without naming the Adani Group specifically said that unusual price movement in the stocks of a business conglomerate has been observed in the past week.

Officials confirmed that the statement has been issued in the wake of the Adani matter only.

“As part of its mandate, Sebi seeks to maintain orderly and efficient functioning of the market and has put in place a set of well-defined, publicly available surveillance measures (including the ASM framework) to address excessive volatility in specific stocks. This mechanism gets automatically triggered under certain conditions of price volatility in any stock,"" SEBI said as quoted by PTI.

It further stated that in all specific entity-related matters, if any information comes to its notice, then, as per extant policies, the same is examined and after due examination, appropriate action is taken.

""Sebi has consistently followed this approach on entity-level issues and would continue to do so in the future as well,"" it added.

Stock exchanges BSE and NSE have put three Adani group companies -- Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, and Ambuja Cements -- under their short-term additional surveillance measure (ASM), which basically means that intra-day trading would require a 100 percent upfront margin and is aimed at curbing speculation and short-selling in these stocks.

US short-seller Hindenburg Research in a report on January 24 published a report on Adani Group accusing it of improper use of offshore tax havens and flagging concerns about high debt that sent the Group stocks to crash.

The group holds short positions in Adani group companies. Hindenburg Research said evidence that the Group has engaged in a 'brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.'

Caught between a row over the price of coal and this week’s crash in its share valuations and credit ratings, the Adani Power project planned as a major Indian infrastructure push to provide electricity to Bangladesh may be delayed by another six months, local reports said.

The project is one of a number in the neighbourhood — including those in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Myanmar — that have accompanied the Narendra Modi-led government’s “Neighbourhood First” initiative in the past few years. Highlighting the big-ticket announcements, Adani chairperson Gautam Adani has met with regional leaders, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in September 2022 and then-Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, while Adani family members have met with senior officials from Myanmar and even Indonesia.

However, with the group’s slide in fortunes and the cancellation of the Adani Enterprises FPO, governments in neighbouring countries are watching the company’s market situation closely, even as the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) made it clear that any setback to projects would not affect ties, emphasising that the Adani stock’s fall was “not a foreign policy issue”.

“If a certain project is not working for financial or economic reasons, I don’t think that’s a reflection on the relationship,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday.

Project delayed again

He was responding to questions about the controversy surrounding an Adani thermal power project in Jharkhand’s Godda, which was due to supply electricity for Bangladesh starting from January 2022, a deadline that has already been delayed twice.

According to the United News of Bangladesh’s report quoting government officials (which has not been denied), the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has written to Adani Power demanding that they reduce the price of coal to be purchased from Adani’s Carmichael Mines in Australia. Presently, Adani Power is reportedly billing Bangladesh $400 per metric tonne, far higher than the $250/MT rate that BPDB is paying at its other thermal plants.

The Adani Group did not respond to requests for a comment from The Hindu, but it is understood that unless BPDB sends a demand note for procuring the coal, the Godda project transmission will be delayed further. State officials quoted in a number of local reports say that the project’s prime lenders, State-owned Power Finance Corp. (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corp. (REC) would then have to sign off on the delay.

MIngling corporate-national interests

Other Adani projects in the region have also been in the limelight for various controversies, including in Myanmar, where the Adani group exited a $290 Yangon river port project in 2022 after the threat of U.S. sanctions.

In Sri Lanka, an uproar had followed the leak of a November 2021 letter from the Ceylon Electricity Board’s then-chairman M.M.C. Ferdinando to the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry asking them to allow an Adani proposal for a 500 MW wind energy project off the coast of Mannar, and to treat it as a “proposal from the Government of India to Sri Lanka”. When asked about this during a parliamentary committee meeting, Mr. Ferdinando, who later recanted his words, said that he had been summoned by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who told him that he was under “pressure” from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to okay the Adani proposal. Mr. Rajapaksa denied the allegation, and Mr. Ferdinando resigned in June 2022 after withdrawing his statement.

Officials told The Hindu that the government is watching developments in the wake of the latest trouble for the Adani Group, given that Sri Lanka, which is in the middle of a financial crisis, is hoping to see more infrastructure investment from India. Apart from renewable energy, the Adani Group has also begun construction on the $700 million Colombo port project for the West Container Terminal and officials said that they “are not concerned at the moment” as the funding for the port is on a “strong footing”.

‘Adani forays seen as push by India’

Meanwhile, officials in Nepal are also tracking developments in the Adani saga, given the group’s plans to lay transmission lines to connect hydropower projects in Nepal to a planned South Asian renewable energy grid. Such a grid would provide power from Nepal and Bhutan to India, Bangladesh, and possibly Sri Lanka in the future. After Nepal PM Sher Bahadur Deuba’s visit to Delhi last year, when he and Mr. Modi had issued a joint vision statement on energy cooperation, Adani Group officials had visited Nepal with a particular interest in hydropower projects in the Karnali Basin. However, they have not made any announcement yet, possibly given the recent change in government.

“Definitely people in Nepal are interested in the developments [around the Adani group] as the group is seen as close to the current Indian administration and their forays into Nepal were generally viewed as part of a push by the Indian establishment”, said Sujeev Shakya, a business consultant and founder-chair of the Nepal Economic Forum.

The Adani Group declined requests from The Hindu for a comment on the sustainability of project financing in the neighbourhood, especially given the current developments. In a region where energy and connectivity are in high demand, India’s neighbours will be particularly interested in how quickly the group can stabilise its position in order to procure funding for its projects.","The project is one of a number in the neighbourhood — including those in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Myanmar — that have accompanied the Narendra Modi-led government’s “Neighbourhood First” initiative in the past few years.

""The department has also sent a proposal to CBIC (the department’s parent) to appeal against the Tribunal's order before the apex court. A legal view will be taken before moving the SC,"" said a government official privy to the development. These sources also pointed out that no fresh evidence can be submitted before the apex court and the appeal is only on points of law and fact.Other than the entities, the appeal also names three individuals including Vinod Shantilal Shah alias Vinod Shantilal Adani, court documents accessed by ET states. The appeal was filed on November 11 and the matter was further listed on December 16.“In May 2014, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (“DRI”) had issued SCN to APML and APRL alleging over-valuation.In August 2017, the Adjudicating authority of DRI i.e. the same authority who issued the SCN after dealing with in detail, set aside all the allegations and dropped the SCN. It has been held by the Adjudicating Authority that all the imports were genuine being undertaken at arm’s length and concluded that the value declared is correct and the value is not required to be re-determined (had dropped the SCN and had given a favourable order in the matter).On appeal by Customs Department, CESTAT, Mumbai in July 2022 dismissed the appeal filed by Customs Department and upheld the Order of Adjudicating Authority. The matter has not yet been listed for hearing,” spokesperson for Adani group told ETThe Hidenburg report that has hit Adani group stock had mentioned the DRI investigation. The total m-cap of the group has declined to Rs 10 lakh crore on February 3, 2023, from Rs 19.2 lakh crore as of January 24, 2023.Responding to the alleged involvement of Adani family members in instances of round-tripping of diamond consignments at grossly inflated values to and from India, the group in a press release slamming the report had said, ""Certain allegations concerning diamond exports have all been closed by the Customs Excise And Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) in our favour. This decision has been further confirmed by the Supreme Court itself twice over, a fact which has been deliberately ignored and concealed in the Hindenburg report (which contemptuously raises questions on the competence of the appellate tribunal with baseless claims that it has ignored evidence),"" the group said.In July 2021 – after minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the DRI is investigating certain entities belonging to the Adani Group – the conglomerate approached the CESTAT seeking early hearing on the matter, saying it had been getting enquiries from independent directors, auditors, financial institutions and lenders about the status of the case.In July 2022, the tribunal in its order observed that the department’s case pertaining to alleged over-valuation is based on certain documents received from the foreign branches of the Indian banks which were not certified as per the conditions prescribed under Section 138 C (4) of the Customs ActThe tribunal also observed that the investigation carried out by the DRI was ‘incomplete’. The tribunal opined that while the department submitted the documents received from the Indian banks, it failed to make the foreign banks join the probe. “...since the department could not interrogate or make Standard Chartered Bank join the investigation cannot be a reason to ignore the possibility of it acting as an active banker on behalf of EIF (the offshore entity) for the purpose of remitting the amount of original equipment manufacturer,” said the tribunal order. “The burden was on the department to prove why the total remittance amount was only through these two banks and no other bank. It, therefore, follows that the investigations carried out by the revenue was incomplete,” the order said.On March 15, 2014, the DRI sent a common show cause notice alleging that EIF, an entity based in Dubai, Adani Power Maharashtra Ltd (APML) and Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd (APRL) were related entities for the rweason that EIF was owned and controlled by Vinod Adani through EIH – the holding company of EIF – and that he was also a shareholder in Adani Enterprises Ltd , which in turn owned and controlled APML and APRL through its subsidiary Adani Power Limited.The show cause notice also alleged that APML, APRL, Electrogen Infra FZE (EIF) and other respondents conspired to siphon off foreign exchange abroad for the benefit of their related entities.The notice called upon the respondents to show cause as to why the declared value in respect of the goods imported by APML and APRL should not be rejected under Rule 12 of the Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007.According to the DRI’s case, “...in the guise of import of power sector machinery and equipment, APML and APRL, the two entities of Adani Enterprises Limited, appear to have indulged in over-valuation of impugned imported goods. The actual value of the imported goods is Rs 3187.61 crore, whereas the same have been invoiced at Rs 7161.73 crore, thus leading to an over-valuation Rs 3974.12 crore which appears to have been siphoned off abroad through EIF, an intermediary at UAE, which is controlled and managed by Vinod Adani, one of the promoters of Adani Enterprises Limited (flagship company of the Adani Group).” The Adani Group has repeatedly denied that Vinod Adani is a promoter of the group.However, the tribunal observed that when documents are not admissible in evidence, the department cannot seek re-determination of value on the basis of these documents.","""The department has also sent a proposal to CBIC (the department’s parent) to appeal against the Tribunal's order before the apex court.

SBI’s exposure includes $200 million from its overseas units, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Dinesh Kumar Khara, chairman of SBI, said earlier on Thursday the Adani Group companies were servicing the loans and he doesn’t see an “immediate challenge"" to whatever the bank has lent so far.

The Reserve Bank of India, the nation’s banking regulator, had asked lenders for details of their exposure to the conglomerate following a rout in group companies’ stock prices, Bloomberg News reported earlier Thursday.

A representative for SBI didn’t respond to an email seeking comment on the exposure.

The exposure by various financiers to companies controlled by Gautam Adani has come under increasing scrutiny after their shares plunged following a scathing report from US-based Hindenburg Research. Wealth units of Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. have stopped accepting securities from the group as collateral for margin loans to their clients, Bloomberg News reported earlier.

Adani has repeatedly denied the allegations and called the report “bogus,"" and threatened legal action.

Other domestic banks are also confident the Indian group can service its loans.

State-run Punjab National Bank’s exposure to Adani companies was 70 billion rupees, Atul Goel, its chief executive, told reporters last month. About a third of it was to Adani’s airport business and cash-flows back the entire advances, Goel said.

Private sector IDFC First Bank Ltd. said in an exchange filing on Thursday that the funded outstanding exposure to the Adani Group was less than 0.1% of its total loans. Meanwhile, IndusInd Bank Ltd. with a loan book of 29 trillion rupees said its exposure to the conglomerate accounted for 0.5% of its loan book.

This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. Only the headline has been changed.","State Bank of India, the country’s largest financier, has given loans of as much as $2.6 billion to companies in the Adani conglomerate, or about half of what is allowed under rules, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The saga has just begun,"It takes a particularly dramatic event–or series of events–to take over the news cycle the week the Union Budget is presented. The Adani imbroglio did just that. While the Budget and, to an extent, Economic Survey, did make a valiant attempt at taking over headlines, theirs was a short-lived time at the top.

As soon as the immediate analysis was done, media houses across India quickly returned to the sensational ongoing topple of the erstwhile third-richest man in the world, Gautam Adani.

And that is why Adani Enterprises and the continuing assault on it is ThePrint’s Newsmaker of the Week.

413 pages of drama

The week started with a bang. On 29 January, Adani Group released a 413-page response to the various allegations made against it by Hindenburg Research, a United States-based short selling firm. Adani came out with all guns blazing. In its reply, the group claimed to have answered all of the 88 questions Hindenburg posed in its original report that was released on 24 January.

Perhaps Adani Group also felt it could take advantage of the Right-wing social media cohort rallying around it. The company claimed that Hindenburg’s report was “a calculated attack on India” and also the independence, integrity, and quality of Indian institutions.

The fightback didn’t stop there. Adani Group went on to take aim at Hindenburg itself, saying it “has not published this report for any altruistic reasons but purely out of selfish motives and in flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws”.

Hindenburg’s scathing reply to Adani

Hindenburg was quick to respond, publishing its reply to Adani Group on the morning of 30 January. Right off the bat, Hindenburg took on Adani Group’s claims, which equated an attack on itself to an attack on India. “To be clear, we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future,” Hindenburg said, adding that they also “believe India’s future is being held back by Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation.”

We also believe that fraud is fraud, even when it’s perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, Hindenburg added in its reply. Clearly, this David was not going to take Goliath’s attacks lying down.

The short seller went on to say that “in terms of substance, Adani’s ‘413-page’ response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to our report.” Indeed, it is worth noting that, in Adani’s lengthy response, the annexures–containing background information on past court cases and judgments–began on page 55.

Hindenburg pointed out that although Adani Group claimed to have answered all of its questions, it had side-stepped the critical issue of Gautam Adani’s elder brother Vinod Adani, his alleged front companies and their alleged dealings with the Adani Group firms.

In what has come to become the hallmark of Hindenburg’s brutal style, it said: “In other words, we are expected to believe that Gautam Adani has no idea why his brother Vinod lent massive sums of money to Adani entities, and no idea where the money originated from.”

If any of that were true, Gautam could have easily cleared up the mystery by calling his brother, Hindenburg further asked in its scathing reply. “Or asking him [Vinod Adani] at the next family dinner, why he has been directing billions of dollars to Adani-controlled entities through a network of opaque offshore shell entities,” it added.

Beginning of turmoil

This was just Monday morning; the week was just beginning.

Throughout Monday and Tuesday, Adani Group managed to rally a fightback against the bears in the stock market, with the Adani Enterprises stock ending both days marginally higher. This recovery must have brought considerable relief for Gautam Adani, coming as it did after a wipeout of about Rs 4.17 lakh crore of value from Adani stocks the previous week.

This relief, however, was short-lived. On Wednesday–Budget day, incidentally–news emerged that Credit Suisse Group AG, a Swiss investment banking firm, had stopped accepting Adani Group bonds as collateral for margin loans given to its private banking clients. While it didn’t come right out to say it, this basically meant Credit Suisse no longer trusted the value of the bonds issued by Adani companies.

This move was followed by more international buzz on the issue. Media houses claimed that there were indications that the Adani Group had allegedly used various shady channels to invest funds in its own follow-on public offer (FPO), another potential sign of weakness and malfeasance.

What followed was the savage destruction of market value for Adani stocks. The Adani Enterprises stock ended the day’s trading session with a massive 28.45 per cent down. Then came the big and surprising news: Late Wednesday night, Adani Enterprises announced they were cancelling their Rs 20,000 crore FPO–the biggest that India had seen–to “protect investors”.

This announcement was unprecedented and embarrassing, and it’s probably not a coincidence that Adani released it at night, long after the stock markets had closed and after most news agencies had wound down for the day.

Take a breath, and drink some water; that was just Wednesday.

If a rising tide lifts all boats, a tsunami drowns them all. Those who could bail out did. On Thursday, news came in that Jo Johnson, brother of former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, had resigned as director on the board of Elara Capital, a UK-based company linked to the Adani Group and one that featured prominently in Hindenburg’s original report.

The same day, Citigroup’s wealth arm said that from 7 February onwards, it would also stop accepting securities of Adani companies as collateral for margin loans.

The blows didn’t stop there. The National Stock Exchange on Thursday announced that it was placing shares of Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, and Ambuja Cements (an Adani company) under additional surveillance. Internationally, the S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would be removing Adani Enterprises from its sustainability indices “following a media & stakeholder analysis triggered by allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud”.

Phew. That’s Thursday done. At the start of Friday, and at the time of writing, the stocks of Adani listed companies continued to plummet, having already lost $120 billion–or around half the Adani Group’s value–since the original Hindenburg report came out. Adani Enterprises’ stock recovered briefly through the day, but ended Friday’s trade down 2.2 per cent.

The week is done, and Gautam Adani must be grateful that stock markets are shut on weekends. But it’s a safe bet that this story still has a way to go. Indian regulators are yet to officially enter the fray.

He said that retail investors should not suffer and that the Adani Group shares will continue to tank for a few weeks. Salve’s comments come at a time when Adani Group is battling a rout in its stocks due to the scathing report by the US-based short-selling firm Hindenburg Research.

Salve, who is also a practicing Supreme Court advocate, told India Today’s Rajdeep Sardesai: “He has done a wonderful thing by withdrawing the FPO because the retail investor should not suffer. For the next few weeks, the shares will tank. They will try and control it, but the shares will tank. These allegations will be investigated and thrown out in some time and confidence will be rebuilt. But in the meantime, Hindenburg gets away with it.”

He stated: “Till the time the market continues in this volatile condition, there is bound to be an erosion of confidence. It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and trust, and a moment to destroy it.”

On Thursday, Gautam Adani announced that the company board felt it was not morally right to go ahead with the Rs 20,000 crore FPO issue due to market volatility on Budget day. He added that the interest of investors is paramount and everything else follows thereafter.

He said, “After a fully subscribed FPO, the decision of its withdrawal would have surprised many. But considering the volatility of the market seen yesterday, the board strongly felt that it would not be morally correct to proceed with the FPO.”

During the course of this interview, Salve also took a jibe at the US-based short-selling firm and said some people like making money by leveling such allegations. He further noted that Gautam Adani’s grandchildren will fight the case if the Group sues Hindenburg for damages.

Salve said: “Where India lacks is that in India, we don’t have the legal framework to take on a Hindenburg. If we sue them for damages, Gautam Adani’s grandchildren will be fighting the case.”

Meanwhile, nine companies of the Adani Group have lost $107 billion in market cap after six straight sessions of a blood bath at Dalal Street or nearly 45 per cent.

On Thursday, SBI's scrip on BSE was trading nearly flat at Rs 527.75.

Adani Group firms' stocks lost combined market capitalisation of over $100 billion in the past week due to a scathing report by US-based short seller firm Hindenburg Research.

Hindenburg Research said it holds short positions in Adani Group companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.

The seven listed companies of the Adani group have an 85% downside on a fundamental basis due to sky-high valuations, Hindenburg said in the report.

""Key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing,"" Hindenburg said.

Earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported that Reserve Bank of India has asked PSU banks for details of their exposure to the Adani Group of companies.

Information being sought by the RBI includes details of collateral being used to back loans and any indirect exposure banks may have, Reuters reported quoting sources.

“There is nothing alarming about Adani exposure and we don't have any concerns as of now,” Khara told Reuters last week, adding that Adani Group hasn't raised any recent funds from the bank.

The Indian banking sector's direct exposure to the Adani group was just 0.6%, Societe Generale said in a report on Wednesday. It said markets are ""overpricing"" the risk to Indian lenders of their exposure to the Adani Group and that a selloff in banking shares seemed overdone.

Adani group shares sank on Thursday after it abandoned its flagship company's $2.5-billion stock offering, swelling the conglomerate's market losses to more than $100 billion and sparking worries about the potential systemic impact.

Adani Enterprises plunged nearly 20% on Thursday, trading at its lowest since March 2022. Other group companies were also under pressure - Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone was down 5%, while Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission lost 10% each.

Nifty Bank index has lost 5.4% since the New York-based short-seller released its report.

Punjab National Bank has a total exposure of Rs 7,000 crore to Adani Group, but there is currently no worry pertaining to those accounts, the state-run lender's managing director and chief executive said on Monday.

""Out of Rs 7,000 crore, around Rs 2,500 crore is related to Adani's airport business,"" PNB CEO Atul Kumar Goel told reporters at a virtual press conference after the company's quarterly results.

This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in...",2023-02-04 02:45:14+00:00,Market has won & now it’s for Adani to decide whether he will lose or not,"This week’s National Interest isn’t about Gautam Adani. This is, instead, about Indian capitalism.

This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in our independent history. Or, more precisely, post-1991 history. Since the expansion, opening up and modernisation of Indian markets began in the summer of 1991, many crises have struck it periodically.

Among these were Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh, Fairgrowth and others. Each one held out a crippling threat to Indian markets and to the new equity culture among common Indians, which is so crucial to a new capitalism.

Each rocked Parliament, pauperised many well-meaning investors and sent some crooks to jail, if briefly. But there are five crucial differences between these and now:

• None of these crises arose when the Indian markets and economy were globally integrated.

• These were crises of domestic markets where domestic interventions, either by financial or regulatory institutions — or even a phone call from North Block — could make a difference. The latest one is playing out fully in global markets and, more importantly, international media.

• The old crises — check out the so-called KP-7 (KP for Ketan Parekh) for example — mostly concerned Indian companies doing the bulk of their business in India. This one is about India’s most globalised corporate.

• The earlier crises emerged here, and the whistleblowers or investigative journalists who exposed these were Indian. This one has been triggered by a very foreign and tiny financial institution.

• The fifth, and the most significant, difference from the standpoint of this column — is that those who’ve created this kerfuffle aren’t whistleblowers. Nor are they activist shareholders. They are coming at it purely for profit. They are short-sellers. They have a fully disclosed vested interest in bringing down the share price of a company they’re ‘investing’ in by short-selling its US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments. Who said you only make money in the stock markets when your share goes up?

Also Read: Prannoy and Radhika Roy and the world of news this week on

The reason we list this fifth difference as the most critical is simple. When foreigners invest in our companies, when our companies list overseas, when the world sings our praises, when FDI and FPI figures zoom, we celebrate. Do we, at the same time, have the nerve to take the downsides that come with it?

One, that we, our government, financial institutions or regulators can no longer influence or arm-twist this all-powerful entity called the ‘market’.

Two, the need to accept that even what looks like a bunch of young upstarts can look to make mega profits by taking down one of your biggest conglomerates in the market. Markets in good capitalism have no nationalist lens. If money has no colour, it also carries no passport. And those who play in the market love their money first. All national, political or ideological loyalties come after that.

It is for all these reasons that we call the ongoing crisis the greatest stress test for Indian capitalism yet. And as we conclude the first full week of the market action on this, we can acknowledge that so far, Indian capitalism has passed that test. In fact, with a score of almost 10 out of 10. Surprised?

Almost two weeks into the crisis, the Modi government hasn’t said a word about it. None of the regulatory institutions has intervened in the market in any manner whatsoever, least of all as if to help the Adani Group absorb the blow better.

The conglomerate has been left to its own devices. If at all, the NSE has done the usual — and prudent — thing of increasing margin payments to curb excessive speculation. This is fully the NSE’s mandate in a situation of heavy volatility.

While the conglomerate called it a foreign conspiracy to attack and damage India and its institutions, the government, the entire finance ministry establishment, regulators and the ruling party leadership have all kept mum. Never mind the flag.

If India’s most powerful political establishment in almost five decades responds to a situation like this as if it’s something that must only play out between a corporate and the market, it is the coming of age of Indian capitalism. It is as if ‘let the market take its course’ is the new ‘let the law take its own course’.

Think, on the contrary, what would have followed if the mighty Indian state had acted in the way it might have when our political economy was less evolved. Really bad ideas like the suspension of trading and the launch of investigations against the “greed, amoral, and what-have-you” short-sellers could’ve found currency.

Even the whiff of such a false step would’ve done enormous damage to India’s markets, the global trust on which a booming new economy rides, and indeed to our still very adolescent capitalism. And please don’t say this talk is nonsense, that no such thing would ever be possible. The scar of the retrospective Vodafone amendment on global trust in India is still to heal fully. We have to be grateful that such ideas aren’t floating around now.

Essential to the embrace of capitalism is the acceptance of the fact that losses are as much a part of business as profits. Nobody can pass a law mandating only profits in the markets.

That’s why mutual fund sellers keep repeating that statutory warning: Mutual fund/equity investments are subject to market risks. It’s also because these investments involve risk that governments tax capital gains on equities and equity mutual funds at lower-than-normal rates.

The lesson for common folk, therefore, is not to get irritated when that statutory caution is repeated in so many advertisements between overs during your T-20 live telecast. Losses are as much a part of the market as profits. Hindenburg has only underlined to us that you can also make profits from “losses” if you’re a short-seller with nerve — and information.

The reason the market, particularly one as large and spread out as India’s, is so powerful is that it can never be identified with any individual. Not one, not many, not even a cohort. Think of it as a mob of anonymous moneyed millions. There is safety in numbers. Which is further fortified by that one-line ideology that governs the market: I love my money.

People can follow this god or that, vote for one party and detest another, love one football or IPL franchise and hate another. But they will never let any of this affect their choices on the market.

The only thing that matters here is ‘my money’. Of course, I can make the wrong choices, but never because of my politics, religion or loyalties. This is what makes money the most secular god of all. Which in turn makes the market the most powerful monarch. At least in the world of capitalism.

If you are in the market — never mind whether as a corporate, conglomerate, broker, banker or even an ordinary day trader or investor — understand the fundamental law that applies: May you be ever so high, the market is above you.

In this round, the market has won. But it is still for Adani now to decide whether he has lost or not. Accepting defeat would mean continuing to fret and fight with the market, with money or other clout, finding shelter underneath the supposedly ulterior motives of the short-seller.

The other way would be to take the blow with humility, as a bad day in the market. Focus on the many good and bounteously cash-yielding businesses and assets more sharply, rebuild what just got broken, and hope that the market will love you again in the course of time. This would be good capitalism.

Prior to the start of the Parliament's session for the day, like-minded Opposition parties got together to discuss their plans.

Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh, in an interview with ANI, claimed that Adani's ""mountain of lies and fraud"" is disintegrating like a house of cards. Prime Minister Narendra Modi must address the matter, the AAP MP urged.

""Adani's mountain of lies and fraud is crumbling like a pack of cards. Crores of investors in the country are worried. Those who have invested in LIC, SBI because both of them have given loans worth crores of rupees,"" Singh said.

""The prime minister should come forward and address the issue. The finance minister should tell what the RBI, ED, and CBI are doing. Why is the government silent on such huge corruption? FPO is just the beginning, the mountain of lies will fall,"" he added.

The AAP MP said that he had written to PM Modi requesting that the passport of Gautam Adani be confiscated. ""I have written to PM Modi, CBI and ED to confiscate Adani's passport, otherwise if he flees the country like other businessmen, what would the crores of people do?"" he said.

On this subject, a number of opposition lawmakers have sent notices to the relevant houses of parliament suspending business. But, shortly after the Session started, both Houses were postponed till 2 PM.

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut told ANI that, in both Houses of Parliament, Opposition parties would bring up the Hindenburg report and the Adani stock crash. Congress’ Manoj Tewari urged that a joint parliamentary committee look into the matter.

""We demand an investigation by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the issue. We will raise the demand inside the Parliament. If the government doesn't accept our demand, we will take appropriate steps. We'll demand that a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) should be constituted to go into the alleged aberrations. The question is not only about one promoter but about the efficacy of the entire regulatory system,"" Tewari said.

Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra earlier slammed Gautam Adani after the Adani Group chairman had announced that his company would cancel the ₹20,000 crore follow-on public offer (FPO), fully subscribed on January 31.

“Keep fooling @SEBI_India & don’t disclose source of money,"" Moitra tweeted.

On February 1, in order to safeguard the interests of its investor community by returning the proceeds, the Adani Group stated that it chose to withdraw the FPO in light of the recent market volatility.

Shares of Adani Group fell further on February 2 as a result of the conglomerate cancelling a critical $2.5-billion stock sale due to market volatility, which increased its market losses to more than $100 billion and raised concerns about a possible systemic impact.

Hindenburg Research’s decision to only go short on Adani Group securities outside India has highlighted the limitations of the practice in the nation and the peculiarities of the business empire itself.India’s authorities have imposed a bevy of restrictions on short selling, including requiring institutional investors to disclose planned trades to the stock exchange before they are executed, and making their retail counterparts close positions each day. They also enforce the globally-favored ban on naked shorts, the practice where investors sell shares they haven’t borrowed first.Shorting the Adani Group also comes with its particular difficulties. The Indian-listed entities all have a relatively low free float and few institutional investors, which means there is a scarcity of shares for short sellers to borrow, and they are therefore more expensive. Founders and controlling shareholders hold at least 60% in nine of the 10 stocks, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.The fact that there was little short selling of Adani shares meant there was hardly any short covering that would normally limit a stock’s downside.“The delicious irony is that shares of Adani companies are tanking hard or limit down partly because India makes it so hard to short in the first place,” short-selling specialist Scorpion Capital Partners said last week in a tweet. There was “no one to step in on the other side,” it said.Hindenburg made clear in the disclosure to its report that its positions were all offshore. The shorts on the Adani Group’s companies were held through U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivatives, along with other non-Indian-traded reference securities, it said. The short seller declined to comment on its decision to use offshore instruments, when contacted by Bloomberg.Theoretically the potential gains are enormous. A trader who sold $1 million Adani Enterprises Ltd . shares at the open on Feb. 1 and bought them back at the end of the same day after the record 28% plunge would have made about $280,000, excluding fees and transaction costs, according to Bloomberg calculations.Shorting Adani Group shares is far more costly than betting against some of its Indian peers.Borrowing stock of Adani Enterprises cost traders 8 rupees (10 US cents) each on Jan. 16, the latest available figure, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a January average of 0.22 rupee for shares in Reliance Industries Ltd ., India’s largest stock by market value.But even for other stocks, the market for borrowing and lending in India remains tiny, according to Kamal Visaria, founder trustee at Visaria Family Trust in Mumbai.India’s stock-lending-and-borrowing segment “hasn’t matured at the rate at which it was expected to and is still very small relative to similar mechanisms in more developed markets,” he said.In the US, shares borrowed amounted to about 4.2% of float across the market at the end of last quarter, according to S3 Partners, a provider of financial data. In contrast, volumes in India’s $3.2 trillion cash equities market are negligible and the derivatives segment is more liquid and typically used by traders, Visaria said.Given that shorting Adani stock in India can be problematic, short sellers may prefer to use derivatives.An India-based investor can either buy put options, sell calls, sell futures or create a multi-leg options strategy that benefits from a fall in shares of four of the Adani group stocks listed in India, namely Adani Enterprises, Ambuja Cements Ltd ., ACC Ltd . and Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd.Volumes for options linked to Adani stocks have surged amid the volatility. Open interest on such contracts linked to Adani Enterprises — or positions yet to be settled — climbed to a record last week.Even to do this though, global investors need a Foreign Portfolio Investor license to be able to trade onshore derivatives, which can be difficult to obtain despite the regulator easing rules in 2019.“It’s a very laborious process,” said Soren Aandahl, founder of short-selling firm Blue Orca Capital LLC, who is known for his bets against Hong Kong-listed companies. “It’s very difficult to get that license approval from a regulator.”Alternatively, there are offshore derivatives traded in Singapore and Dubai, but liquidity in those instruments can be extremely thin. About 216,800 lots of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone’s contracts for February delivery were traded via the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. by late Friday, compared with just 90 in Singapore.“There’s a lot of hurdles to trading that market,” Aandahl said of India. “And unfortunately with India, the ones that you can trade through the offshore futures exchanges, they tend to be just much bigger companies but even so the liquidity is not that fantastic.”--With assistance from P R Sanjai and Matt Turner.","They also enforce the globally-favored ban on naked shorts, the practice where investors sell shares they haven’t borrowed first.Shorting the Adani Group also comes with its particular difficulties.

Guha Thakurta said he was not willing to hazard a guess on the future of the Adani conglomerate. He said his response to the questions posed by The Telegraph only stated facts.

Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, the journalist who found prominent mention in the Hindenburg Research report that triggered turmoil in the share prices of the Adani Group and cast international glare on Indian probity in corporate governance, breaks his silence two-and-a-half years after a court in Ahmedabad issued a gag order asking him not to speak or write anything that may go against the interests of the Adani Group.

“I do not want to commit contempt of court. I have only given you facts,” Guha Thakurta told this newspaper on Sunday. Excerpts from the conversation follow:

Q: What piqued your interest in the Adani conglomerate?

Guha Thakurta: I started writing about the Adani Group because I write about the corporate sector, the economy — my area of interest as a journalist is political economy…. I have been a journalist for 45 years and I am now 67 years old.

The rise of the Adani Group has been truly spectacular. Very few people had heard about the Adani Group even 20 years ago. Until 10 days ago, he was the world’s third richest man, Asia’s richest man. Now, he’s fallen off from that perch after the shares of his listed companies crashed. So, if the rise of the Adani Group has been spectacular, the fall has been even more spectacular. Very few of us, including myself, could ever have imagined, before the Hindenburg Research report came out on January 24, that the Adani Group would not continue to rise.

Q: What sets the Adani Group apart from many other Indian corporates?

Guha Thakurta: What is truly out of the ordinary is the manner in which the Adani Group exercises dominance over so many sectors and segments of the Indian economy. It is the largest commercial port operator in India. It operates a dozen ports along the west and east coast of India. Internationally, it has the Haifa Port in Israel, and Abbot Point in Australia.

Adani is one of the largest private sector airport operators, the second-largest operator of coal mines after CIL (Coal India Ltd); it has mines in Indonesia and in Australia. It is the single biggest importer of coal to India, the second-largest generator of electricity from coal after NTPC.... The Adani Group also used to be the biggest aggregator of cut and polished diamonds 15 years ago — it divested this interest to others, including Winsome Diamonds of Jatin Mehta, who is the father-in–law of Vinod Adani’s daughter (Vinod is Gautam Adani’s brother). Jatin Mehta is currently outside the country. Winsome Diamonds happens to be one of the largest non-performing assets.

Q: When did you first write about the Adani Group?

Guha Thakurta: My article in 2015 was by and large a compilation of materials that were already in the public domain. The first article that one may call exclusive appeared in April 2016 by when I was the editor of the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW).

I wrote several articles in the EPW, including on allegations of misuse of benefits by the cut-and-polished diamond business of the group, about the pricing of power. The last article I wrote for the EPW in June 2017 pertained to the changes in the rules concerning power projects in SEZs (special economic zones)....

It also talked about how the government — the ministry of finance and the ministry of commerce -- were processing an application for a refund of customs duties in excess of Rs 500 crore without first checking whether the duty had been paid. The matter reached Parliament.

Q: You stepped down from the EPW shortly after this?

Guha Thakurta: As you know, I resigned in July 2017 after the board of trustees of the EPW said I should not be writing articles in my name because that’s what my predecessors had done. I was told they were thinking of appointing a co-editor; that I had destroyed the ethos of a prestigious publication which is like an institution. I was told that I had done an act of grave impropriety by engaging the service of a lawyer pro bono to respond to a legal notice that was served to the publisher, printer, writer and the editor of the article. And finally, I was told to take the article down and not to leave the room until the article was pulled down. I called a colleague of mine, pulled down the article, got hold of a piece of paper and wrote out my resignation.

Q: But you continued to write on the Adani Group?

Guha Thakurta: The article taken down by the EPW was published by The Wire (the news portal). Several people came out in my support, including Professor Amartya Sen and renowned scholar Noam Chomsky. Afterwards, my articles on the Adani Group by and large appeared in other publications, notably NewsClick. I became a consultant with NewsClick in May 2018.

Q: Isn’t there a gag order against you?

Guha Thakurta: I am the only citizen of India against whom lawyers representing companies headed by Gautam Adani have instituted six defamation cases that are currently pending in the courts of law.

Two of the cases are before the first class judicial magistrate at Mundra in Gujarat, two in courts of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, one in Baran district in Rajasthan, and one in Delhi.

In September 2020, the courts in Ahmedabad issued a gag order on me, my co-author Abir Dasgupta and NewsClick headed by Prabir Purakayastha, that we cannot speak, say or write anything that goes against the interests of Gautam Adani and his conglomerate.

There was an article which was considered to be defamatory — the contents of the article were not challenged. The headline was deemed to be defamatory.... It was the last of the series of three articles.

The allegation against me, my colleagues and NewsClick was that we have lowered the esteem of the judiciary in the eyes of the public. The case is currently pending and I cannot say anything more on this.

Recently in the Rajasthan case, several of us appeared before the magistrate at the Grameen Nayalay in Baran district to provide bail bonds and sureties for the bail bonds.

The article which was pulled down by the EPW was challenged by the Adani Group, saying it was defamatory. Cases were moved against the entities that run The Wire, my co-authors and myself. It went to a civil court in Bhuj and to a criminal court in Mundra. But now both are in Mundra.

Q: Was there any attempt to arrest you, as mentioned in the Hindenburg report? Were you jailed?

Guha Thakurta: In January 2021, while the pandemic was on, a non-bailable warrant of arrest was issued against me by a first-class judicial magistrate in Mundra. My lawyer argued that this non-bailable warrant was bad in law. He referred to the judgments of the Supreme Court where it was written that if a person fails to appear in court, you can issue a bailable warrant. If that person still does not appear, the court can issue a non-bailable warrant. This case relates to the article pulled down from the EPW and published by The Wire later.

In May 2019, before the results of the Lok Sabha elections were announced, the Adani Group withdrew the cases against everybody — The Wire, my three co-authors but I am the only person against whom the case continues. To answer your question, I was never arrested.

Q: Did you collaborate with Hindenburg Research?

Guha Thakurta: I never heard of it before the report came out. However, the report, which consists of 32,000 words, if printed as a book, can run into 150 pages. It makes several references to the work done by me and independent journalists like Abir Dasgupta who I collaborated with. But they must have accessed the materials which are in the public domain.

Q: Do you feel vindicated today after the Hindenburg Research report came out?

Guha Thakurta: Yes, I do.

Q: Have you met Gautam Adani?

Guha Thakurta: I met Gautam Adani on two occasions — May 2017 in Mumbai, and then in February 2021.

I had a long telephone conversation with him very recently.

But on each of these occasions, I met him on conditions that it would be off the record. I did not record those conversations. During each of the conversations, except for the telephone call, there were people with me.

A former colleague was with me in 2017 and in 2021, there were five of us in the room, including Gautam Adani and my wife. The first meeting lasted for about an hour while the second one lasted one hour and 55 minutes, to be precise.

The phone call lasted about 15 minutes.

Q: Did you initiate the interaction?

Guha Thakurta: The first meeting took place at my behest. The second one was by my lawyer Anand Yagnik who arranged it with the expectation that an out-of-court settlement could be arrived at. But that did not happen. The last phone call was a request from me to withdraw the cases.

Q: What was his response?

Guha Thakurta: He was non-committal. The cases are still pending as we speak.

Q: Since you have written a number of articles against top companies and conglomerates, have you faced court cases before?

Guha Thakurta: Many corporates have sent legal notices but nobody has actually taken me to court. Legal notices were sent by lawyers representing corporate entities headed by both the Ambani brothers. Subrata Roy of Sahara never took me to court either.

Q: These cases must have taken a toll on you?

Guha Thakurta: Yes, these cases do have an impact on me and my life. Takes up time and involves expenditure. But if you ask me if I would have done anything differently, I would say ‘no’.","Very few people had heard about the Adani Group even 20 years ago.
So, if the rise of the Adani Group has been spectacular, the fall has been even more spectacular.
Very few of us, including myself, could ever have imagined, before the Hindenburg Research report came out on January 24, that the Adani Group would not continue to rise.

She alleged that Gautam Adani, the chairman of Adani Group, had misused the system to acquire many businesses. The government, Moitra said, should launch a thorough probe as the country's reputation and financial stability were at risk.

Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Motira said an investigation by the market regulator Sebi was ongoing but Adani Group put out a statement saying it had been exonerated by the highest court of the land. ""Which court? Which nation?"" she asked. The parliamentarian further said that Gautam Adani, in his response to charges by Hindenburg, said his brother had no formal designation in the group so any transactions with his brother and entities controlled by him not be disclosed as related transactions.

""Why has Sebi been the silent operator? Why would they permit a Rs 20,000 crore FPO without (submitting) an investigation report? Why didn't Sebi ask whether bankers had signed off on the valuation? How's Mr A's son's father-in-law allowed to be on the Sebi committee on insider trading and corporate governance? How?"" Moitra asked while firing a barrage of questions at the government.

""What about the DRI, what about customs? What about GST? What are they doing? This is the deception of the highest order,"" the TMC MP asked. Adani, she alleged, has been permitted to use LIC, SBI, and the PSU banks to get money as and when he liked. She said LIC already had Rs 36,000 crore exposure to the group and the SBI had an outstanding loan of Rs 27,000 crore. ""Why were they again anchor investors in FPO?"" she asked.

Last month, Adani Group launched Rs 20,000 crore FPO (Follow-on Public Offer). For the first few days, the response was tepid due to the adverse report by Hindenburg and the subsequent stock plunge. However, the issue was subscribed fully by the closing day. The next day, markets crashed further, wiping off significant money of new investors in just a day. Rocked by the market volatility, the conglomerate called off the FPO saying it would not be morally correct to go ahead with it.

Today, Moitra alleged that the government tweaked rules to favour Adani. ""Odisha's Dhamra LNG Terminal was not awarded by tender. And even if it is awarded by tender, rules are tweaked to favor him (Gautam Adani). For example, when he won six airport tenders, the Airport Authority of India delayed the handover for three airports. He invoked force majeure (unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract), and they accepted it.""

The TMP MP further alleged that the GVK was forced to sell its stake to the Adani Group. She said GVK built the Mumbai airport, and they did a fantastic job. ""On July 2, 2021, the CBI filed a case against the GVK group. On July 18, the ED raided GVK in Mumbai and Hyderabad. Then they sold 50.05 per cent to A's company,"" she said.

Moitra said Adani managed to use his proximity in the shipping ministry to prevent dredging in Mumbai ports for years. ""So the traffic in JNPT (Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust) can't grow."" She also alleged that GAIL and IOC were manipulated into signing a Rs 46,500 crore 20-year pay or use contract for him in Dhamra that he got without tender.

Concluding her discussion, the parliamentarian said that India was on its way to becoming the third-largest economy in the world. The government, she said, should immediately order a thorough probe into all matters as the country's reputation, system, and stability of the markets were at risk. ""Don't worry about infrastructure assets. We have world-class infrastructure companies that can easily take over his businesses,"" she said.","TMC MP Mahua Moitra on Tuesday slammed the government and regulators for not probing the allegations against the Adani Group by the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research.

Under the bid, worth Rs 5,400 crore, the Adani Group was supposed to supply around 7.5 million smart meters to the power distribution company.

In a notification dated February 4, the state discom said: “The tender has been cancelled due to unavoidable reasons.” The notification added that UP discoms, such as Madhyanchal, Dakshinanchal, Purvanchal, and Paschimanchal, had floated tenders for the supply of more than 25 million smart meters. The combined value of the whole project was Rs 25,000 crore.

MVVNL had invited the e-tender for the appointment of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) service provider for smart prepaid metering in MVVNL.

The Adani Group had submitted the lowest bid of Rs 10,000 per smart meter. But MVVNL officials termed it as very high, following which the discom cancelled the tender citing “unavoidable reasons”, the discom notification said. The MVVNL has now allowed all the companies to re-bid into the process.

Besides Adani Group, GMR, L&T, and Intellismart Infra had submitted their tenders for the project. It is interesting to note that none of these companies are manufacturers of smart meters. After winning the bid, the companies would probably engage smaller manufacturers to produce the smart meters.

Now, the discom is likely to opt for a fresh tendering process. There is a possibility that other UP discoms involved could tread a similar line after MVVNL’s step.

Meanwhile, the UP power consumers’ forum had already challenged the bids before the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC).

Under the standing billing guideline of the Rural Electrification Corporation, the price of the meters had been fixed at Rs 6,000 per unit.","Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (MVVNL), Uttar Pradesh's power utility, has cancelled its order to Adani Group to supply smart meters to the electricity distribution company (DISCOM).

Ltd. is an offshore company that is a major shareholder in Adani Power, the energy firm at the heart of Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's business empire, reported Wall Street Journal.



In its most recent quarterly report, Adani Power portrayed Opal as an independent stakeholder with no ties to the ports-to-power complex other than its 4.69% ownership in Adani Power.



According to corporate filings obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Opal was formed on the island country of Mauritius by Trustlink International Ltd., a financial-services firm with ties to the Adani family.



As per the Mauritius filings, one of Trustlink's directors, Louis Ricardo Caillou, is on the board of Opal. Caillou is also named as a board member of another Mauritius-based firm, Krunal Trade & Investment Pvt. Ltd., with Adani's older brother, Vinod Adani, and Subir Mittra, the CEO of the Adani family office.



According to the documents, Trustlink International, another Mauritius-based company, serves as both companies' secretaries.



The central issue raised by claims made by American short-seller Hindenburg Research is whether Adani executives or family members have any control over decisions made by businesses like Opal.



Last week, Hindenburg published a 104-page study accusing the Adani Group of many frauds, including the establishment of phoney firms to artificially raise stock prices and violate India's shareholding laws.



The ports-to-power conglomerate has refuted the allegations, claiming that the stock manipulation claim made by short-sellers has ""no basis"" and is the result of a misunderstanding of Indian legislation.



Uday Kotak, an industrialist and banker, stated earlier today that he does not believe current developments pose a systemic risk to the Indian financial system. The large Indian corporations, he claimed, are more dependent on international sources for debt and equity financing.



After being fully subscribed on January 31, Adani Enterprises Ltd. opted to withdraw its FPO worth Rs 20,000 crore on Wednesday.

It can’t be dismissed as ‘suspect’,"Nearly 4,000 years ago, King Hammurabi of Babylon established Law 229, which said that if a builder builds a house and it collapses, causing the death of the resident, then the builder shall also be put to death. Hammurabi posted his set of laws in a public square for every literate person to read, and believed this law was necessary to ensure high-quality construction in his empire. Author Nassim Nicholas Taleb cites this nugget of history to explain his philosophy of ‘skin in the game’, an ethical principle of symmetric incentives. It is a seemingly simple but intuitively hard-to-grasp idea of an equal share of risks and rewards for all stakeholders in a transaction.

The ongoing Hindenburg – Adani saga can be viewed through this prism to explain some of the confusion and scepticism ascribed to Hindenburg’s motives.

Hindenburg Research, a US-based short-seller, published a voluminous research report that cast severe aspersions on the Adani Group’s operations and claimed in a shrill manner that Adani was the ‘biggest con’ in corporate history. But they didn’t stop there; they also revealed that they had placed a ‘big bet’ against the shares of Adani Group, and stand to gain if the shares drop in value. And the implied corollary, that they would lose all their money if they were proven wrong and the shares did not fall. In essence, Hindenburg put their money where their keyboard was.

Senior political leaders, public commentators and even economics professors in ivy league universities have questioned Hindenburg’s motives and argued that the report is just a facade to drive the price down and gain profits. They argue that Hindenburg published a fallacious and exaggerated report because the short seller made a bet against Adani shares and is not indulging in some act of investor protection. So, was Hindenburg’s revelation of its ability to profit from the report a case of ‘skin in the game’ or skewed motive?

How Hindenburg shook Adani

Let us suppose that a pure research entity or a media publication released the exact same findings. Their veracity would have still been questioned and, perhaps, dismissed even more quickly as a vested shoot-and-scoot operation, because these were mere agencies with nothing to lose but something to gain from the report. In fact, there have been several reports by research shops, or media stories in the past, that have highlighted some of the very same issues that Hindenburg has raised about the Adani group. Those were waved away nonchalantly, either through intimidation with the threat of a lawsuit, or labelling them as ‘easily motivated operations.’

Hindenburg’s transparent disclosure that it stands to gain financially if its report was taken seriously, or lose if it wasn’t, created symmetric incentives that established the credibility of the report. It was a signal to the market that they believed so strongly in the quality of their research that other Adani shareholders would be convinced to sell their positions, and hence, the stock price would fall. In Talebian terms, Hindenburg had ‘skin in the game’ in this transaction.

Hindenburg could have chosen one of many options in this case:

1: Publish a report without betting against the share price

2: Bet against the share price without publishing a report

3: Publish a report, take a bet but do not disclose their short bet against Adani shares

4: Publish the report, bet against the shares and be transparent.

Options three and four satisfy the ‘skin in the game’ condition, but option four also signals to the rest of the market about Hindenburg’s ‘skin in the game’, which was the option it chose.

Hindenburg’s report not ‘suspect’

To be sure, I am not for a moment arguing that markets are perfect and cannot be manipulated by mischievous reports. If any, I believe markets are more often imperfect than perfect. But to argue that Hindenburg’s motive is suspect because it stood to profit misses the entire notion of symmetric incentives because it also stood to lose its money if the market did not believe its report. Adani Group had the opportunity to disprove and discredit the report and cause a lot of financial ruin to Hindenburg. The fact that they failed to only reaffirms the veracity of Hindenburg’s findings, at least before the market.

It is common practice in the world of finance for investors to buy shares of a certain company and subsequently talk up that company in public to let the world know, so that they can benefit from a rise in its share price. This is an accepted norm, and it is left to the markets to either believe or disbelieve the greatness of that company. No one questions the motives behind this established practice. But even erudite people seem to struggle to accept the flip side of the same practice—to talk down a company in public and bet against its shares.

The idea that one can profit from a fall in the share price seems to be far more challenging to comprehend and accept for most people than the idea of profiting from a rise in the share price. This asymmetry of the human mind has been researched and documented in great detail by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman and Israeli mathematical psychologist Amos Tversky, who called it “loss aversion”. Ethical philosophers may justifiably argue that it is worse to profit from someone else’s misfortune than from their fortune; hence, the two cannot be equated. But that is beyond the scope of this discussion.

Betting against a share or ‘short sell’ establishes symmetric incentives that are more credible. It is naïve and fallacious to argue that a ‘short sale’ induces perverse incentives, but a ‘long sale’ does not. The fact that Hindenburg could lose money if its report was wrong or rebutted easily, was actually the biggest signal of its credibility. Arguably, the exacerbated problem of ‘fake news’ in the modern world is, at its core, a problem of asymmetric incentives, where there is no punishment but ample reward and encouragement for false reportage in the guise of free speech. Establishing symmetric incentives, like in the Hindenburg example, can be a solution to stem the fake news malaise in society. But in this specific case, Hindenburg’s ‘skin in the game’ act removed Gautam Adani’s skin, metaphorically.

Prospective candidates have been ruffled by the fraud and stock manipulation allegations made by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research that triggered a $100 billion sell-off in Adani stocks and forced the group to pull the ₹20,000 crore follow-on public offering (FPO) of Adani Enterprises Ltd.

The diversified conglomerate runs businesses ranging from green energy to airports and ports and is a large recruiter.

“During our meetings with the client firms, we were told that it is business as usual and there has been no impact on the ground. We are conveying the same to the candidates who are in the crore-plus salary bracket,"" said the head of an executive search firm.

However, Adani group said there is no impact on “senior-level hiring"".

“All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group’s core fundamentals remain unchanged, and our robust systems, which are focused on creating a healthy work ecosystem, ensured that there is no impact on any senior-level hiring,"" a spokesperson for Adani group said in response to Mint’s queries.

Recruiters said while the senior candidates are on the edge, there is no impact so far on the junior and middle order.

“Valuation of companies and trading prices do not have any impact on hiring mandates. These are very early days still, and the group, which has companies across businesses including solar power, has manpower needs which span over many years,"" said Lohit Bhatia, president of workforce management at Quess Corp.

Bhatia said that unless cash flows get impacted, it will be business as usual for the group and its hiring targets.

The outlook of some Adani group companies were downgraded to negative by S&P Global Ratings on Friday. Although lenders and the Reserve Bank of India allayed fears of any stress on banks’ books because of the Adani stock rout, India’s top three state-run banks—State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Bank of Baroda—have an aggregate exposure of around ₹40,000 crore to various entities of the Adani group.

“The Adani Group also relies heavily on its internal hiring team, and right now, if there is an impact on hiring, it is because of the sentiments and market perception,"" said another senior headhunter of a Mumbai-based search firm, seeking anonymity.

On Monday, promoter Gautam Adani prepaid $1.11 billion in loans ahead of maturity and release pledged shares in Adani Transmission Ltd, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd and Adani Green Energy Ltd. The move is aimed at restoring investor confidence and easing the selling pressure in group stocks.

The promoter’s early payment will result in the release of 168.27 million shares of Adani Ports, 11.77 million shares of Adani Transmission, and 27.56 million shares of Adani Green, according to a statement issued by the group on Monday.","However, Adani group said there is no impact on “senior-level hiring"".

Financial Times,,MSCI revises Adani Group weightings after free float review,https://www.ft.com/content/88e468fd-be08-4fdd-ba5a-f64f06f2bf28,"Adani Group stocks are in several of MSCI's equity benchmarks including the India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock indices. Rival index...",2023-02-09 05:30:16.091000+00:00,MSCI revises Adani Group weightings after free float review,"Global index provider MSCI has changed its weightings for some Adani Group stocks after reviewing how many shares could be freely traded, in a further setback for the Indian conglomerate reeling from fraud allegations.

MSCI on Thursday evening said it had cut its determined free float for four companies in the Adani Group: Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC. Free float measures for four other companies in the group remained the same.

The cuts, which will come into force at the end of February, will result in smaller weightings for those stocks in MSCI’s closely watched indices, triggering outflows as investors who track the benchmarks reduce their shareholdings.

On Wednesday, MSCI said “certain investors” in Adani Group “should no longer be designated as free float pursuant to our methodology” after receiving feedback from “a range of market participants”.

MSCI defines the free float of a company’s shares as the proportion available for purchase in public markets by international investors.

Indian tycoon Gautam Adani’s sprawling airports-to-energy empire has come under intense pressure and lost more than $100bn in market capitalisation after short seller Hindenburg Research accused his group of fraud and stock price manipulation.

The wipeout prompted a margin call from lenders, which include Barclays, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, on a $1.1bn share-backed loan, while France’s TotalEnergies paused a planned $4bn hydrogen project with the group.

Adani Group stocks are in several of MSCI’s equity benchmarks including the India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock indices.

Rival index provider FTSE Russell said last month that Adani index constituents included in its benchmarks “will continue to remain eligible in accordance with the underlying index methodologies”.

Shares in Adani Group’s listed companies sold off following Wednesday’s statement, with flagship business Adani Enterprises falling as much as 15 per cent after posting gains for two straight days.

An Asia equity strategist at one Wall Street investment bank said MSCI was likely to follow the precedent set by previous reviews of different companies and cut its free float estimates by about half.

“Potentially the weight of Adani stocks in the indices will be cut in half as a result, and passive investors will have to sell to reduce [the stocks’] weight accordingly in their portfolios,” the strategist said, adding that the bank estimated this would result in about $1bn-$1.5bn of outflows.

Those outflows will add to pressure on the company’s Mumbai-listed shares, which are components in MSCI’s India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock benchmarks.

The Adani Group did not respond to a request for comment.

Hindenburg’s report alleges that the Indian business empire uses funds domiciled offshore in Mauritius to conceal the true extent of the Adani family’s ownership of the group’s listed companies, as well as to skirt rules governing how much stock insiders can own.

Nathan Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg, said on Twitter following the MSCI announcement: “We view this as validation of our findings on offshore stock parking by Adani.”

The Adani Group, whose stocks account for more than 3 per cent of MSCI’s India index, has denied the claims.

Indian tax officials visited one of the warehouses of Adani Wilmar, the group’s joint venture with the Singapore food processing business, in the state of Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday evening.

“The officials did not find any irregularities in the operations and dealings conducted by the company,” said Adani Wilmar. “We would like to emphasise that this was a routine inspection carried out by the relevant authorities and there was no raid as previously stated or reported in the media.”","MSCI on Thursday evening said it had cut its determined free float for four companies in the Adani Group: Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, at the end of 2022, held a stake in Adani Total worth $83.6 million, a stake in Adani Ports worth $63.4 million and a stake in Adani Green Energy of $52.7 million.

The fund, managed by a unit of the central bank, owns 1.3 per cent of all globally listed shares with stakes in some 9,200 companies.

On January 31, the CEO of Norway's $1.3-trillion oil fund said the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund has been reducing stakes in Adani Group companies owing to the ""complex situation"" arising out of potential risks attached to the ports-to-power conglomerate.

“We have sold out of quite a few [of Adani companies] and we have reduced in some of the others. So we have very, very little exposure compared with what you would have expected us to have,” Nicolai Tangen told UK's Financial Times.

Adani Group stocks have been facing intense volatility ever since US short seller Hindenburg Research's January 24 alleged improper use of offshore tax havens and concerns about high debt, which Adani denied, but the subsequent market meltdown has led to a dramatic and sudden fall in group chairman Gautam Adani's fortunes.

The oil fund reduced its positions in Adani companies because of risks such as potential corruption, environmental damage and human rights abuses, Tangen had said.

“It’s a complex situation. We have a separate department that is looking at risk-based divestments . . . We started to look at this a long time ago, and so we have taken a lot of exposure out.”

The oil fund, which usually owns on average 1.3 per cent of a stock, had holdings at the end of 2022 of 0.3 per cent in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, 0.17 per cent in Adani Total Gas and 0.14 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

Financial index provider MSCI said on Thursday that some Adani securities should no longer be designated as free float, after market participants raised concerns about the eligibility of the Indian conglomerate's companies for some of its indexes.

MSCI, the US-based creator of widely-watched stock indexes, said in a statement that it ""has received feedback from a range of market participants concerning the eligibility and free float determination of specific securities.

""MSCI has determined that the characteristics of certain investors have sufficient uncertainty that they should no longer be designated as free float ... This determination has triggered a free float review of the Adani Group securities,"" it added.

Changes for Adani securities associated with its MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes are due to be announced later on Thursday as part of its regular review for February.

MSCI defines the free float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that is considered available for purchase in public equity markets by international investors.

In response to the MSCI statement, Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson wrote on Twitter: ""We view this as validation of our findings"".

Some of Adani companies shares had been rebounding this week but tumbled again on Thursday after the MSCI announcement. Adani Enterprises sank 11.2 per cent, after losing as much as 20 per cent in early morning trade.

Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas and Adani Power were each down 5 per cent, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone were down nearly 2.9 per cent.

Nuvama's price target post Q3 results suggests 62% potential upside,"awl-share-price-366595"" target=""_blank"">Adani Wilmar reported a good set of December quarter results. Nuvama Institutional Equities said Food and FMCG business is now contributing 15 per cent of volumes and 7 per cent of value, a positive sign, as the Adani group company's strategy is to focus on positioning itself as a foods business. What the brokerage did not like was the 8 per cent YoY drop in realisation per tonne. The domestic brokerage has cut its target on the stock to Rs 680 from Rs 708 earlier, which still suggests a potential 62 per cent rise over Wednesday's closing price.

On Thursday, the scrip rose 5 per cent to hit a high of Rs 440.30.

Nuvama said the company's wheat flour and rice offerings have been growing well on the back of increased distribution reach and new product launches. Adani Wilmar has continued to gain market share in edible oil, which is the major revenue contributor, with volume growth of 9 per cent YoY despite weak demand for baking and frying industry. Alternate distribution channels(other than GT) registered a strong YoY volume growth of 32 per cent YoY, it said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi wears special jacket made of plastic bottles at Parliament Budget Session

The management argued that gross profit/tonne (up 5 per cent YoY) and PBT/tonne (up 2 per cent YoY) was more relevant.

""Increase in the benchmark rates increased the interest cost for the quarter and is expected to be more or less similar. Bangladesh operations reported loss in Q3 driven majorly due to unfavourably forex impact and price caps on edible oil by government. Additional 20 per cent duty on rice led to slowdown in rice exports,"" Nuvama said.

Nuvama said while Adani Wilmar competes in an extremely competitive business (edible oil and foods/FMCG), it has consistently delivered strong volume growth across segments. The brokerage has cut its FY23E-FY25 by 4.4-8.2 per cent with a roll over to FY25E, yielding a target of Rs 680.

Adani Wilmar had on Wednesday reported a 16 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 246 crore for the December quarter compared with Rs 211 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter advanced 7 per cent YoY to Rs 15,438 crore compared with Rs 14,371 crore in the same quarter last year. The Adani group company said volume for the quarter grew 16 per cent YoY, thanks to large opportunity available in the packaged food industry.

Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Technical Research Analyst, at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said, ""For the last five months or so Tata Power has been making lower highs and lower lows which resulted in a 23 per cent cut in price. Since last two months, the said counter has made a nice base near Rs 205. Still, there is no clear breakout or breakdown sign on the counter. One needs to wait and watch as of now.""

Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One, ""Any sustainable move beyond Rs 215-217 can trigger a much-awaited momentum which can push prices toward the Rs 228-230-odd zone.""

AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades said, ""Tata Power is bearish with strong resistance at 215. A daily close above this level could lead to targets of 225-238 in the coming weeks. Support will be at 195.""

Adani Power

Ajit Mishra, VP - Technical Research at Religare Broking said, ""Traders should refrain from taking any positions in Adani Power. On the downside, Rs 140-155 zone could offer some support.""

Vaishali Parekh, Vice-President - Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, suggested that the stock movement is now event-based and investors can take decisions at their own risk.

Tips2trades' Ramachandran said, ""Adani Power is a riskier bet given all the news surrounding the Adani group stocks but a daily close above Rs 186 could lead to targets of Rs 199-222 in the coming weeks.""

It must be noted that Adani Group stocks took a major hit recently after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research alleged that the Indian conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the last few decades. Adani Group, however, refuted the claim as baseless.

Telegraph India,,Adani link makes poet decline award,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/adani-link-makes-poet-decline-award/cid/1915503,A poet in Tamil Nadu has declined to accept an award recognising women achievers because the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group.,None,Adani link makes poet decline award,"Sukirtharani told The Telegraph that associating herself with the programme would have been “antithetical to my principles, my body of writings and my philosophy for which I have stood so far”.

A poet in Tamil Nadu has declined to accept an award recognising women achievers because the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group.

Also an activist and teacher of Tamil at a government school in Ranipet district, Sukirtharani had been chosen for the Devi Awards by the organiser, The New Indian Express (TNIE) newspaper group. The event was held at a Chennai hotel on Wednesday and the awards were handed over by former top cop and Puducherry lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi.

This year’s edition of the Devi Awards was sponsored by the Adani group, the Vellore Institute of Technology and apparel brand Ahujasons, a report in The New Indian Express said on the event.

Sukirtharani’s decision to decline the award was reported by Justice News, an initiative of Peoples Media Advocacy & Resource Centre (PMARC), which seeks to bridge the divide between Dalit groups and mainstream media as well as civil society.

“I was among the 12 women personalities chosen for the Devi Awards-2023, organised by the TNIE, from across the country for their distinguished contribution in their respective fields of work,” Sukirtharani said.

“The selection was done by a team of experts. I respect their judgement. I wrote to them in an email thanking them for selecting me, but said I would not be able to accept the award as the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group,”Sukirtharani told this reporter over phone from her village near Ranipet.

Sukirtharani had been chosen for her contribution to Dalit literature. “I had initially agreed to accept the award, but it was only on February 3that I came to know that the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group,” she said.

Sukirtharani added: “Asa writer, I found it unacceptable to be associated with a function whose main sponsor was the Adani group as it is antithetical to my principles, my body of writings and my philosophy for which I have stood so far.”

Known for her bold and blunt style of writing, Sukirtharani, who was born in 1973 in a poor Dalit family and whose father worked as a daily wage-earner in a factory, drew attention to how the allegations of fraud in the Hindenburg Research report against the Adani group had disturbed her.

Besides, “the manner in which the group has been involved in developing the Kattupalli port (north of Chennai), taking over farmers’ lands and displacing rural labour, I do not agree with all these”, Sukirtharani said, adding that these were the reasons why “I declined the award”.

Sukirtharani has six collections of Tamil poetry and has received several awards like the Pudhumaipithan Memorial Award, the Women Achievers Award, the Avvai Award and the Vibrant Voice of Subalterns Award. Several of her poems feature in college curricula in Tamil Nadu and have been translated into English, Hindi, Malayalam, Kannada and German.

In an interview to the Indian Cultural Forum in September 2021, Sukirtharani had spoken about her activism. “The moment I set foot outside my house, caste chases me like a dog. Though official records say India has over six lakh villages, there are actually 12 lakh villages in all, because of the caste divide in each of them. The village I come from is also divided into two — the village proper and the Dalit area.... My social activism is motivated by the desire to unite these two divided sections.”

In August 2021, Delhi University’s Academic Council had unilaterally removed the writings of Sukirtharani and Bama alias Faustina Soosairaj from the English honours syllabus. DMK president and Tamil Nadu chief minister M.K. Stalin had condemned the move and said the removal of the writings was “blatantly partisan and completely unacceptable”.","A poet in Tamil Nadu has declined to accept an award recognising women achievers because the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group.

Embattled Adani group has appointed accountancy firm Grant Thornton for an independent audit of some of its companies in a bid to come clean of the damning allegations levelled by the U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research and to assure investors and regulators.

Sources said the audit is primarily to show to regulators like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that the group has nothing to hide and it is in compliance with relevant laws.

The audit will specifically look into if there was any misappropriation or repatriation of funds and if loans were used for any purpose other than the one they were intended for.

The audit, they said, would go a long way to show that the books are healthy and project executions are on track - something that the investors are keenly watching given the damage to market value that the Hindenburg report has caused.

As the run on its shares continued, Adani Group had on Monday attempted to calm the market, saying its growth plans are intact, business plans are fully funded and it remains confident of delivering returns to shareholders.

Market value of the group's seven listed companies has halved since the January 24 report by the U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that Adani pulled ""the largest con in corporate history"" using offshore tax havens and stock manipulation.

The group has denied all allegations, calling them ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"". It called Hindenburg the ""Madoffs of Manhattan"", referring to the late financier and fraudster Bernie Madoff.

""Balance sheet of each of our independent portfolio companies is very healthy,"" the group spokesperson had said. ""We have industry leading development capabilities, strong corporate governance, secure assets, strong cash flows, and our business plan is fully funded.""

The group debunked reports of a cut in growth goal and capex. Projects may be delayed but none is shelved or deferred and plans for expansion of solar, green hydrogen and airports were on track.

""Once the current market stabilizes, each entity will review its own capital market strategy, be rest assured, we are confident in the continued ability of our portfolio to deliver superior returns to shareholders,"" the spokesperson added.

The Adani crisis has sparked worries of financial contagion in India and ability to carry on infrastructure projects.

Last week, French oil major TotalEnergies said it would wait for the result of an independent audit before proceeding with investing in Adani Group's $50 billion plans to make green hydrogen.

According to Bernstein Research, Adani Green is capable of paying off all its debt of ₹22,000 crore due in the financial year ending in March 2025, if it divests some renewable energy assets, seeks fresh equity capital from existing investors, or cancels some planned projects and avoids bidding for new ones.

The spokesperson, however, termed questions over the group's ability to fund projects and refinance debt as 'unfounded speculation'.

Last week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the ratings outlook for four Adani group companies to negative from stable, while index provider MSCI said it would cut the weightage of some of its stocks in its indices.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the country's regulators are very experienced and are seized of the matter relating to the Adani Group crisis.

Stocks bearing the Adani name appear in over 500 so-called Article 8 funds that are supposed to “promote"" ESG goals, provided that the companies in which the investments are made follow good governance practices under European Union rules, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

As many as 80 of those exposures are through direct holdings, while the remaining are mostly through funds of funds or index trackers, the data shows, which correct for duplicate holdings.

As the Adani Group companies get stripped from indexes and are put under review amid allegations of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation, ESG investors are once again left wondering why a strategy intended to shield against risks such as greenwashing and bad governance – often at an extra fee – didn’t protect them from the latest meltdown.

What are ESG funds

ESG funds are investments which make investment commitment based on environmental, social, and governance factors. A firm that makes investments in an ESG fund should be well-run and also have a positive impact on the environment and society as well.

Also, ESG funds seeks to benefit society and the environment while also producing financial returns.

ESG analysts believe that the strong headwinds faced by the Adani Group could impact access to offshore ESG-linked financing plans of other Indian firms.

An individual who tracks ESG investments has termed the Adani crisis as a bad omen for India’s green energy ambitions.

In the wake of a late January report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, the selloff in the Adani Group's seven listed subsidiaries have cumulatively lost about $120 billion in group market value in the last three weeks.

Funds with nearly $10 billion in assets under management tracking MSCI ESG indexes held shares in Adani Enterprises Ltd alone, as per an analysis by the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute. The institute has been studying the Adani Group since mid-2020.

In a report on Adani published on 9 February, Ulf Erlandsson, AFII’s chief executive officer, and Stephanie Mielnik, its head of fixed-income research, wrote: “Our view is that ESG investors with this unfortunate exposure should engage with their managers and, potentially, regulatory bodies that are better positioned to examine why this index-fund inclusion has occurred.""

Patrick Wood Uribe, the CEO of Util, an ESG research firm backed by private equity and venture capital investors, said the Adani debacle exposes some fundamental flaws in the approach adopted by several ESG index and ratings providers, as well as portfolio managers.

“There can be a very large mismatch with what investors are expecting,"" when they place their money in a company or a fund classified as ESG, Wood Uribe said in an interview. And by offering an “overly simplified view,"" ESG ratings end up doing a “disservice"" to investors, he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.

27% of Article 8 funds meet its sustainability requirement

In an effort to address such concerns, the European Securities and Markets Authority has proposed enforcing minimum thresholds that would require Article 8 managers to apply stricter standards to their ESG claims. A recent analysis by Morningstar Inc. found that if the ESMA proposal is adopted, only 27% of Article 8 funds would actually meet its sustainability requirement.

Adani companies were also held by 11 funds registered as Article 9, which is the EU’s highest ESG classification. Eight of these were through direct holdings, according to an analysis by Bloomberg. In order to justify an Article 9 designation under EU rules, a fund manager needs to prove that a portfolio is 100% sustainable, with allowances made for hedging and liquidity needs.

ESG fund managers are under “increasing pressure"" to be “much clearer with investors about what exactly they are offering and what it means,"" Util’s Wood Uribe said. There remains a “massive opportunity and a massive gap in actually meeting some of those sustainability objectives, actually delivering on what investors would like to see in terms of sustainable investment.""

Util also notes that Adani stock documents were replete with the kind of ESG verbiage that portfolio managers often look for. In its rebuttal of the Hindenburg report, Adani frequently cited the group’s adherence to ESG principles, and pointed to its adoption of multiple global ESG frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), among others.

Adani has denied all allegations, calling them ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"". It called Hindenburg the ""Madoffs of Manhattan"", referring to the late financier and fraudster Bernie Madoff.

ESG ratings firms, meanwhile, have given some corners of the Adani Group conspicuously high scores. Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Total Gas Ltd still carry an “A"" rating at MSCI Inc, according to data on the website of MSCI. Adani Transmission Ltd is rated “BBB.""

All three have lost more than a third of their value since the Hindenburg report was published. A spokesperson for MSCI said the firm is due to conduct a review of its ESG and climate indexes, which may include changes as early as this week.

“This is a conglomerate with operations in commodities, utilities, gas, and airports"" and one that is “engaged in some of the most controversial coal mining projects in recent history, including the largest open-pit coal mining operation,"" Wood Uribe said in a written analysis of the Adani group.

“Thanks to the ‘convoluted structures’ and ‘multiplicity of subsidiaries’ cited in the Hindenburg report, Adani has long been able to finance its dirtier operations with the proceeds of sustainable fund flows,"" he said.

Asia ESG funds global market share doubles

Meanwhile, in Asia, ESG funds have doubled their international market share as political and regulatory upheavals slow inflows for environmental, social and governance investing in the US and Europe.

Barclays Plc analysts including Dave Dai wrote in a note that Asia funds posted net inflows of 15% last year, as against 4% globally. That doubled Asia’s ESG fund market share to 4%, from 2% at the end of 2020, Barclays noted.

Asia’s net inflows into ESG stock and bond funds compared with 5% for non-ESG funds in the region, showing “stronger investor appetite for sustainable investing,"" the analysts further said.

The Congress on Monday asked why the Narendra Modi government cannot agree to a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to probe the Hindenburg Research report’s allegations against the Adani Group if it could agree to set up a committee before the Supreme Court.

Party’s general secretary (communication) Jairam Ramesh, in a tweet, also asked if the proposed committee of experts would examine the New York-based Hindenburg Research or the Adani Group.

“Today in Supreme Court Solicitor General said Govt has no objection to a committee to examine the Hindenburg report on Adani. Then why the stubborn refusal to a JPC which will anyway be dominated by BJP & its allies? But will the proposed committee investigate Hindenburg or Adani?” asked Mr. Ramesh.

Separately, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote to Speaker Om Birla over the privilege notice served on former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi over his February 7 Lok Sabha speech and comments made against Mr. Modi.

Stating that the stock market crashed and thousands of crores of investors’ wealth got eroded because of the ‘wrong policies’ of the business house, Mr. Chowdhury said Mr. Gandhi fulfilled his duty as a ‘public representative’.

‘Public interest’

“The issue was raised in “public interest” and for the service of the nation,” Mr. Chowdhury said, adding that BJP leaders who make derogatory remarks against members of the Gandhi-Nehru family were “never admonished or reprimanded”.

In a related development, the Congress also posed a series of questions to Prime Minister Modi under the Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun series.

Mr. Ramesh alleged that as far back as 2007, the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), while conducting an investigation into the volatility of stocks of Adani Exports (now Adani Enterprise) had found that “entities associated with notorious stock manipulator Ketan Parekh (KP) had indulged in manipulative activities such as synchronised trading/circular trading and creation of artificial volume to influence the price in the scrip of Adani”.

“Why did SEBI tolerate an even more extreme rise in Adani Group stock prices after 2020 without investigating it with the required seriousness?” Mr. Ramesh asked, adding that “a close relative of Mr. Parekh may be still maintaining links with the Adani group.”

He further added that both Congress and BJP governments, in the past, have formed JPCs to probe stock manipulation. While the Harshad Mehta scam was investigated in 1992 by the Congress government, the Ketan Parekh manipulations were investigated in 2001 under a BJP government.

“What are you afraid of? Do you fear that a truly independent investigation might implicate you personally in the Adani Group’s wrongdoings?” asked Mr. Ramesh.

The issue of Adani Group was also raised in the Lok Sabha by Congress member Manish Tewari while speaking on power generation in Punjab and procurement of coal from the Mahanadi Coalfields during the Zero Hour.

“If that coal is brought directly to Punjab via rail road the distance that it has to travel is 1,830 km. The Power Ministry wrote a letter to the Punjab government on November 30, 2022, and said it cannot get the coal directly via rail road and will have to take the coal to Paradeep port, then take the water route passing by Sri Lanka and reach the Adani ports in Dahej and Mundra, and then from there take the coal 1,500 km via rail road to Punjab,” Mr. Tewari claimed.

Alleging discrimination against Punjab and its people to benefit the Adani Group, he added, ”The cost of coal transportation has gone up from ₹4,350 per tonne to ₹6,750 per tonne. The cost of 1KW power has increased from ₹3.6 to ₹5”.","Party’s general secretary (communication) Jairam Ramesh, in a tweet, also asked if the proposed committee of experts would examine the New York-based Hindenburg Research or the Adani Group.

Weakness, however, prevailed in the broader market with almost two stocks ending lower for every one stock that rose, thanks to a handful of disappointing quarterly results by small and midcap companies..

For the day, the BSE Sensex surged 600 points, or 0.99 per cent, to 61,032.26. The Nifty50 Index rallied 158.95 points, or 0.89 per cent, to 17,929.8. Broader markets underperformed the headline peers, as BSE midcap and smallcap indices settled with cuts. India VIX eased about 2 per cent to 13.45-level.

Traders will be keenly looking at US inflation data later in the day, which will provide some cues on the US Fed policy decisions. Most global markets traded higher as investors pinned hopes that key US inflation data for January due later in the day will show downward pressure on prices year-on-year, although gains were limited, said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

""India’s wholesale inflation fell to its lowest level since January 2021, led by a decline in inflation in manufactured products,"" he said. ""Nifty has closed at the highest since January 24. In the process it has formed a bullish ascending triangle type of pattern. It could now stay in the 17824-18027 band for the near term with an upward bias.""

On a sectoral front, Nifty PSU Bank, Metal, FMCG, IT and Financial Services indices rose over a per cent each. On the other hand, the Nifty Realty index plunged 2 per cent. Pharma, Media and Auto indices were among the laggards.

Adani Enterprises settled with a 2 per cent gain, as the company reported profit for the December quarter. Adani Ports jumped 2 per cent while ACC added 1 per cent. However, Ambuja Cements declined over 1 per cent.

Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, Adani Power, Adani Transmission, Adani Wilmar and New Delhi Television (NDTV) were locked at their lower circuit limits of 5 per cent each.

How does Adani get to travel...",2023-02-13 00:00:00,Rahul lashes out at PM; sticks to Modi-Adani nexus charge,"Kalpetta: Senior Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi on Monday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, yet again accusing the BJP leader of having a nexus with industrialist Gautam Adani and going out of his way to facilitate the rise of the businessman.

Rahul was speaking at a public meeting in Meenangadi panchayath stadium during a whirlwind visit to his MP constituency of Wayanad.

The Gandhi scion demanded to know how Adani can travel along with the prime minister on his foreign trips.

""I’ve hinted about the relationship between the prime minister and Adani in the parliament. I did not say anything offensive. How does Adani get to travel along with the prime minister during his foreign trips? How can Adani sign deals while in those countries? A major portion of my speech has been erased from the records. Rules have been tweaked for Adani. How is Adani buying all the airports in the country? Everything is based on his relationship with the prime minister. What I have said is nothing but the truth.

""The parliament secretary said I needed to provide proof for the claims made in my speech. I answered that everything will be given. The prime minister is personally insulting me. But I am not worried about that. I was asked why my name is Rahul Gandhi and not Rahul Nehru. He is fully aware that in India, people use the family name of the father. Modi may have all the agencies in his hand. But I do not fear him. One day Modi will have to face the truth,” he lashed out.

Earlier, Rahul Gandhi alleged in Lok Sabha that the growth of Gautham Adani is the only 'Modi Magic' that happened in the last eight years. He showed pictures of Modi and Adani travelling together during his scathing attack in the Lower House. ""The policy of the BJP government is to ensure one new deal for Adani during every foreign trip undertaken by the prime minister. Wherever Modi goes he takes Adani along with him, or Adani somehow reaches the places where the prime minister is going. Deals in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were signed like that,"" he charged.

Rahul also asked the ruling MPs if they could deny that 90% of the deals signed with Israel in the defense sector had been obtained by Adani. The BJP had filed a rights violation notice against this.

The FMCG stock not just bounced back but it has been able to hold the gains it has registered from its lows. It seems that after the announcement of Q3 results 2023, market is showing confidence in this Adani group stock. KRChoksey believes that Adani Wilmar share price may go up to ₹569 apiece levels in long term, delivering around 40 per cent return to its positional shareholders.

On reasons for being bullish on Adani Wilmar shares, KRChoksey says, ""Adani Wilmar Ltd has reported revenue of ₹1,54,381mn, an increase of 4.3% on a YoY basis and

3.9% on a QoQ basis, with volume growth across all the segments and good progress to gain market share across key product categories. Growth was driven by the extension of distribution networks, an increase in direct reach across urban and rural markets, and excellent execution in alternate channels.""

The brokerage went on to add that alternative channels such as E-commerce, Modern Trade, and eB2B have continued to grow at a much faster rate, owing to a shift in customer behavior. The company recognises a large opportunity in the HoReCa (Hotel, Restaurants, and Caterers) segment and is planning to develop an operating model to drive sales in this segment.

On valuations, the brokerage said, ""Adani Wilmar has shown strong volume growth in Food and FMCG and Industry Essentials with market share gains in Edible oil, Atta and Rice. The share price has been declining due to various news and reports about the Adani Group; however, we believe that this is temporary and the company will perform well because of the company’s strong and sustainable volume growth.

We expect Adani Wilmar to benefit from the recent uptick in demand. Currently, the stock is trading at a PE multiple of 64.8x/41.9x/34.6x based on our FY23E / FY24E / FY25E EPS estimates, respectively.

Data from the social media analytics platform Social Blade shows that the follower count of Hindenburg Research jumped by nearly 2.5 lakh in the last one month with the total count now pegged at nearly 4.5 lakh.

Interestingly, the research firm joined Twitter in July 2017 but there was not much of traction in terms of following as the official handle of the research firm that takes short positions in firms before releasing a report typically gained an insignificant number of followers every month.

The trend registered a huge spike in January with nearly 2 lakh new followers – it had gained a paltry 193 new followers in December 2022.

The activity level also shot up post the release of the report on the Adani Group – which led to the group’s market capitalisation eroding by over $100 billion in a matter of days – as the Twitter handle posted extracts from its report quite frequently – often more than a few times every day.

While there were many tweets – all related to its report on Adani Group -- posted on January 25, the last tweet prior to those were posted on January 9 that was followed by tweets on December 7, 2022.

Similarly, the follower count of Anderson whose Twitter handle is @ClarityToast, also jumped by more than 17,000 in the last one month, with the total follower count pegged at nearly 44,000.

While Anderson calls his Twitter handle a “personal account”, all his tweets are related to reports of Hindenburg. Further, the jump in his follower count has mirrored the trend of Hindenburg's handle with January seeing the count at nearly 7,000 even as December saw his follower count move up by only 430.

Post the release of the report on Adani Group, Anderson has mostly tweeted/retweeted media reports that support the findings of Hindenburg.

Meanwhile, going by the publicly-available data on its site, the research firm that claims to unearth “man-made disasters floating around in the market” has released reports on more than 15 companies till date starting in 2017.

While Indian business conglomerate Adani Group is its latest target, the firm was most active in the year 2020 even as there was a global lockdown on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The research firm earlier released scathing reports on companies like Nikola, WINS Finance, China Metal Resources Utilization, SC Worx, Predictive Technology Group, SmileDirectClub, and Yangtze River Port & Logistics among others.

More importantly, the research firm always takes a short position – designed to profit from a fall in the stock price -- in the company before releasing a report.

Should Gautam Adani take a business tip from Vallabh, an amiable young man who owns and runs a small eatery in Panjim, Goa?

In 1988 Gautam Adani founded Adani Enterprises which, in the span of 34 years, registered a meteoric rise that made him the third richest man in the world.

Then last month, out of the blue, came a devastating lightning bolt. A US-based short seller called the Hindenburg Research accused the Adani empire of all manner of financial skulduggery, including stock manipulation and fraudulent accounting, which torpedoed the conglomerate’s market valuation. Adani lost 50% of his wealth in 10 days, and fell from being the third richest man on the planet in January to the 17th richest in early February, practically a pauper in relative terms.

The Adani group has rebutted all charges of wrongdoing on its part, and has countered by saying that outfits like the Hindenburg Research make money by ‘short selling’, bringing down the value of a company’s shares, then offloading the cut-price stock at a profit, and as such their alleged findings are suspect.

But could there be a different reason behind the Adani meltdown? Has the group – which has fingers in pies as varied as coal and oil exploration, to airports and road building, to cement manufacture and financial services – diversified too much, too rapidly?

If so, Adani should look at the business model on which Vallabh runs his hugely successful Ashok Restaurant in Panjim, an establishment started by his father in 1954, and which has just one item on its menu: xacuti, the coconut-flavoured Goan curry. Customers can choose between chicken or mutton xacuti, take it or leave it. And customers take it, so much so that Vallabh shuts shop by early evening, having run out of supplies.

Vallabh’s wife mixes the spices, and Vallabh does the cooking, to produce what many claim is the best xacuti in the whole of Goa.

Vallabh’s tip for Adani? Stick to one thing, stick to your core competence. Stick to your knitting. Or your xacuti.

New Delhi, February 17

Billionaire philanthropist George Soros believes the turmoil at Gautam Adani's business empire may weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modi's hold on the government - a statement which was strongly countered by BJP as an attack on Indian democracy.

Adani group has been under severe pressure since the US short-seller Hindenburg Research on January 24, accused it of accounting fraud and stock manipulation, allegations that the conglomerate has denied as ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"".

While listed companies of the group lost over USD 125 billion in market value in three weeks, opposition parties inside and outside Parliament attacked the BJP government for the meteoric rise of the ports-to-energy conglomerate. Stocks of most group firms have risen in the last couple of days.

Soros, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Thursday, said Modi would ""have to answer questions"" from foreign investors and Parliament on allegations the Adani group is facing.

His speech drew sharp reactions. Ruling BJP said Soros was not only targeting the Prime Minister but also the Indian democratic system. This war is being mounted against India and what stands between the war and India's interests is Modi, BJP leader and Union minister Smriti Irani told reporters. ""Everyone should condemn his remarks in one voice"".

Soros in his speech said the turmoil at Adani may open the door to a democratic revival in the country.

His near 42-minute speech oscillated between climate change, Russia-Ukraine war, rumbling in the US, Turkey disaster and failures in China.

""Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies; their fate is intertwined,"" he claimed. ""Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards. Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in Parliament."" He did not offer any evidence for his claim.

""This will significantly weaken Modi's stranglehold on India's federal government and open the door to push for much needed institutional reforms,"" he said. ""I may be naïve, but I expect a democratic revival in India."" His comments drew sharp reaction from the ruling establishment.

Kanchan Gupta, senior adviser to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said the faces behind repeated regime change stands exposed.

""Face behind repeated 'regime change' attempts in India with collaborators paid by The Open Society Foundations stands exposed.

India's enemies are many: George Soros leads the pack.

Democracy in India is strong, resilient. 2024 is not too far away and Soros will eat crow again,"" he tweeted, attaching news of Soros' comments.

Gupta went on to state that the Munich Security Conference (MSS) was a platform for discussing global security challenges and seeking paths to peace and stability, not conflict.

""Soros being given a platform to share his subversive 'regime change' agenda to undermine India tells a different story about MSS,"" he said.

The 92-year-old investor started his speech at the conference talking of understanding the current state of affairs and finding a way to distinguish what is important from what is less so.

""Let me start with a bold assertion. While two systems of governance are engaged in a fight for global domination, our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change.

""This is a very succinct statement, but I believe it provides an accurate summary of the current state of affairs,"" he said, devoting a good deal of his speech on climate change.

He then stated that as the founder of Open Society Foundation, he considers open societies ""morally superior"" to closed ones.

At this point, he talks of repressive states and distinguishes between open and closed societies.

""India is an interesting case. It's a democracy, but its leader Narendra Modi is no democrat,"" he claimed.

Modi, he said, maintains close relations with both open and closed societies.

""India is a member of the Quad (which also includes Australia, the US, and Japan), but it buys a lot of Russian oil at a steep discount and makes a lot of money on it,"" he said before turning to Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.

""Erdogan has much in common with Modi,"" he said. ""But, while Modi seemed to be firmly in the saddle until recently, Erdogan has mismanaged the Turkish economy and will face elections in May. All his efforts are focused on winning the elections."" Soros thereafter talked about how Erdogan was ""autocratic"", his attempts to jail opponents and the government's slow response to the massive earthquake in Turkey.

He then made the comments on Modi and his links with Adani before moving on to other countries like Brazil, Russia and its conflict with Ukraine, US president Joe Biden's role in the war and finally to China.

""Turning to China, Xi Jinping would be an obvious loser. His close association with Putin would hurt him. But China may be already undergoing a revolution,"" he said, adding Xi's Zero Covid policy was his biggest blunder.

After devoting time on talking about what ails China, he turned to the US saying democracy isn't functioning ""very well"".

""When Donald Trump became president in 2016, he posed a real threat to our democracy,"" he claimed. ""Trump is a deeply flawed character, a confidence trickster whose narcissism grew into a disease."" He hoped that in 2024 Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida would ""slug it out for the Republican nomination"".

""To conclude, I want to repeat what I said at the beginning: while open and closed societies are in a fight for global domination our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change. I believe this sums up the current state of affairs accurately,"" he added.

After hearing four public interest litigations (PILs) seeking a probe against...,2023-02-17 23:40:22+05:30,Supreme Court seeks transparency on Adani expert panel,"NEW DELHI : The Supreme Court on Friday declined to accept the Union government’s suggestions on the scope and composition of an expert committee to examine all aspects of the Adani-Hindenburg saga that were submitted in a sealed envelope, and said it would appoint the committee on its own in the interests of transparency.

The release of short-seller Hindenburg Research’s 24 January report accusing the Gautam Adani- led conglomerate of corporate malfeasance sparked a crash in shares of Adani Group companies and created a political furore over the billionaire’s alleged proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Adani Group has dismissed all allegations as baseless and discredited.

After hearing four public interest litigations (PILs) seeking a probe against Hindenburg for causing significant loss to investors, on regulatory lapses, and an investigation of the Adani Group on the basis of the Hindenburg report, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud reserved orders on the remit and composition of the committee.

After examining a note submitted by solicitor general Tushar Mehta in a sealed cover, the bench, also comprising justices P.S. Narasimha and J.B. Pardiwala said, “If we have to accept these suggestions, we must disclose it to the other side. There has to be transparency and confidence in the process.""

The government proposed a six-member committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge, comprising the Union home secretary and director, Enforcement Directorate. The note required the committee to submit a report in eight weeks with the initial report to be filed in sealed cover considering the “volatile and emotion driven"" nature of the securities market. However, the government’s note clarified that the constitution of the committee would not be a reflection on the ability or competence of the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) or any other statutory body.

The bench said, “If it is in a sealed cover, the petitioners will not know which names we accepted and which we have not and they will get to say it is a government-appointed committee."" Following a course of action that it adopted in the past of choosing a committee of its own to examine the Pegasus spyware row where the phones of prominent individuals were allegedly placed under surveillance, the bench said, “We’d rather not accept the sealed cover suggestions in constituting a committee, as we want to follow full transparency. We will appoint a committee in which there will be more confidence."" The court did not wish to put those names in public domain either: “It will not be good for the individuals. We will do it on our own.""

The Centre’s note also dealt with the proposed terms of reference for the committee with the primary task being “to ascertain the truthfulness of allegations against the Adani Group of companies in the Hindenburg report."" The probe, the note added, would also focus on Hindenburg’s admission of acquiring a “short position"" in Adani group debt and derivatives, gathering details of all its transactions undertaken prior to publication of report, and assessing whether the transactions fall foul of the penal, statutory and regulatory framework in India.

The remit of the committee, the note said, would also include suggestions to strengthen the regulatory framework for better protection of investors in future. In addition, the note suggested examination of all short-selling in Adani Group shares “prior to and in near proximity of the Hindenburg report"".

The court also disagreed with Mehta’s submission that there was no larger market impact of the report.

“You have said in your submissions that the market impact was zero. There cannot be denial of the fact that investors have lost money worth lakhs of crores of rupees.""

To be sure, given the low public float of the stock of Adani companies, much of the loss was in the notional wealth of the promoters.

Advocate M.L. Sharma, who was the first to file a PIL, sought an investigation against Hindenburg for a “conspiracy"" to inflict loss on the market and the economy and blamed Sebi for failing to protect investors.

Another petitioner Vishal Tiwari said his prime concern was to protect investors while seeking a court-monitored probe into the revelations made in the Hindenburg report. The other two petitions by Congress leader Jaya Thakur and law student Anamika Jaiswal sought probes against the Adani Group on allegations in the report.

The bench said, “Your prayer presumes guilt. Proper investigation is what you are seeking. We will close it for orders.""

The solicitor general suggested having statutory investigating agencies and Sebi as part of the committee.

Advocate Prashant Bhushan representing Jaiswal, said, “What is the point of having those people against whom there are allegations."" The court remarked: “We cannot start with the presumption of lapse of regulatory framework.""","The Adani Group has dismissed all allegations as baseless and discredited.

The sealed envelope had suggestions for the committee that the apex court had advised the government to create in order to look into the fall in Adani Group stocks following the Hindenburg Research report, and recommend improvement in statutory and regulatory regimes.

The apex court stated that “true facts” should come out from the expert panel without impacting stock markets. The advice to form the committee came from two PILs that were filed in the Supreme Court in the Adani-Hindenburg case.

""We don't want sealed cover suggestions. Even if we don't accept your suggestions, the other side will have the impression that we accepted the government-adopted committee. I want to have complete transparency. We will appoint our own committee and a sense of trust should be there,"" said CJI Chandrachud on Friday.

“If you're not intending us to disclose the names then trust us to appoint our own independent persons,” said the Chief Justice.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Friday submitted the remit to the bench headed by the CJI.

On Monday, Mehta had stressed that the remit of the committee should be very relevant because any unintentional message to the international investors and domestic investors that even a regulator or statutory monitoring authority also needs a monitoring by a committee appointed by the Supreme Court may have some adverse impact on the flow of money.

He had sought that the court could permit the government to suggest the remit of that committee with possible suggestions of names of the committee in a sealed cover, as it may not be appropriate to discuss in open court hearing.

The court was hearing two PILs, one of which sought a direction to the Centre to constitute a committee monitored by a retired apex court judge to inquire into the Hindenburg Research report, while the other one sought prosecution of short-seller Nathan Anderson of Hindenburg Research and his associates in India and the US for allegedly exploiting innocent investors and the ""artificial crashing"" of the Adani Group's stock value in the market.

Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after the Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate. The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

The punishing stock market sell-off Adani group companies have seen following the January 24 report of Hindenburg Research is a temporary blip concerning just one corporate group and hasn't harmed faith in India as an investment opportunity, he told PTI in an interview.He, however, felt the Adani group needs to ""beef up"" capital and cut down debt to continue to remain on the high growth trajectory.Known for his plain speaking, Singh cited how a Canadian firm had threatened to bring out a report when his retail estate firm DLF was bringing out an IPO one-and-a-half-decade back.""We said push-off (to the Canadian firm)... do whatever you can ,"" he said, adding there are ""blackmailers"" who bring out reports around any big share sale.The Hindenburg report that alleged accounting fraud and stock manipulation at the Adani group, came just as a Rs 20,000 crore follow-on share sale of the conglomerate's flagship firm Adani Enterprises opened.""Completely nonsense,"" he said on the Adani-Hindenburg row impacting India's attractiveness as an investment destination. ""India is too big a country today. So this story will die down. Investment will not be hurt."" Modi is ""a sensible and dynamic person"" and ""so long as he remains prime minister India will remain an attractive destination, he said.The apples-to-airport conglomerate has denied all allegations, calling them ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"".The Adani group's listed firm lost about USD 125 billion in market value in three weeks after the report. Some recovery has been seen in the last couple of days.While the group's rapid expansion - from cement to hydrogen and data centres, has largely been fuelled by debt funding, Singh, who is now chairman emeritus of DLF, said suggestions that banks lent money to the Adani group because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi telling them to do so was rubbish.""What has the prime minister got to do with it (lending money to a corporate)? No banker, even if the prime minister tells anything, will give money unless it is justified,"" he said.""I have no clues about Adani but if somebody thinks today that a call from the prime minister will make bankers give (loan) then they are living in a fool's world. No banker will do this thing.""Citing the example of former ICICI Bank chief executive Chanda Kochhar, who was arrested on charges of irregularities in loans to Videocon Group , he asked, ""Would any banker do anything which is not according to the regulations? No, they won't.""Opposition parties used the Hindenburg report to attack the government, alleging Modi aided the Adani group's rise.The Prime Minister has not referred to Adani by name since the crisis triggered by the Hindenburg report but earlier this month he told Parliament that the ""blessings of 140 crore people in the country are my protective cover and you can't destroy it with lies and abuses"".Singh said Modi need not respond and should continue to do his job.""So many dogs will bark, he should not respond to it. System will take care. They will go away. He should continue doing what he is doing,"" he said.On the troubles facing Adani group, he said entrepreneurs are risk takers but it's always smart to strike a balance between equity and debt.Adani's rival Mukesh Ambani has done the smart thing of balancing debt by bringing in equity investors across businesses.""Every businessman goes through this thing. In your zest for growth, you get debt. (But) Balance debt with equity. And grow again,"" he said, adding Adani was trying to do that through the FPO of Adani Enterprises.Adani group has maintained that its debt of Rs 1.96 lakh crore as on September 2022 was balanced with assets it has and the revenues all the businesses are generating.""Always have a healthy balance between equity and debt.

Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken on Friday asked why the Narendra Modi government was “scared” of forming a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe into the Adani-Hindenburg row, stressing that the issue of handing over strategic sectors like airports and ports to a company, was linked to the country’s national security.

The BJP-ruled Centre’s “dealings” with the Adani Group smacks of “crony capitalism” and the creation of “government-sponsored private monopolies”, he said.

The Congress leader said that the Adani Group enjoyed 30% of the port capacity and 40% of the container capacity of the country.

“The Congress party wants to ask the Modi government why it is scared of forming a JPC on the issue. If the then Narasimha Rao government (Congress) could form a JPC for the Harshad Mehta scam, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee (BJP) for Ketan Parekh scam, then why aren’t you setting up a JPC (for Adani stock rout),” he asked.

The Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after US-based short-sheller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate led by Gautam Adani. The Adani Group had dismissed the charges as lies, saying it had complied with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Asked about Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s claim in a recent interview that there were scams of over ₹12 lakh crore during the Congress era, Mr. Maken said that the BJP government had failed to arrest or prove anyone guilty of corruption in these cases in the last nine years of its rule.

“If they could not do anything, they have no right to say anything. ..Congress is demanding a JPC, an investigation into the matter. At least grant us that opportunity for the investigation. You are denying us the probe,” he said.

He said the Congress would continue to press the government for a JPC probe into the issue as it was concerned about ""the open loot of public exchequer to fund crony capitalists”.

“People want to know how one group with doubtful credentials and alleged links with tax haven-operated offshore shell companies is monopolizing the assets of India, but all the government agencies are either missing from the action or facilitating that very process,"" the former Union Minister said.

Points to remember

Whenever privatisation of public assets takes place, he said, two things must be taken care of— one, there should be “one tender, open bid”, and second, there should be no monopoly.

“This government has set aside both these things to help the capitalists close to it,” Mr. Maken said.

“What worries me is that the company which has received ₹37,000 crore and ₹1,23,000 crore from entities located abroad has been handed over strategic sectors like airports and ports. Then this is the biggest threat for the country,” he said.

The Congress leader said the country wanted to know “who is the real owner of the black money being routed to India via offshore shell companies operating from tax havens”.

“What is strange is that this government is not even ready to investigate where this money is coming from, whether it is the money from China or Pakistan. We demand a JPC probe or Supreme Court-monitored investigation, but it (government) is not ready for even that. It is possible that the money invested belongs to China or Pakistan,” he said.

Adani Wilmar will be part of the Nifty Next 50 and Nifty 100 indices. At the same time, Adani Power will be included in Nifty 500, Nifty 200, Nifty Midcap 100, Nifty Midcap 150, Nifty LargeMidcap 250, and Nifty Midsmallcap 400 indices.

All the changes in the indices will be effective from March 31 this year, the exchange said in a late-night statement on Friday.

The Index Maintenance sub-committee of NSE Indices Ltd has decided to make replacement of stocks in various indices as part of its periodic review.

However, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) did not change its Nifty 50 index.

In the Nifty Next 50 index, apart from Adani Wilmar, other companies included are -- ABB India, Canara Bank, Page Industries and Varun Beverages.

On the other hand, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Gland Pharma, MphasiS and One 97 Communications would be dropped from the Nifty Next 50 index.

Earlier this week, index provider MSCI Inc postponed the implementation of reducing the weightages of two Adani group firms, Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission, in its indices, citing the potential impact of price limit mechanisms.

The decision on the changes in the weightages, which was to be effective this month, has now been postponed to May.

The global index provider had cited potential replicability issues due to the impact of price limit mechanisms in two Adani group firms as the main reason behind the delay.

Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate led by Gautam Adani.

Weak global cues dented the sentiments at Dalal Street as the inflation worries spooked the traders. Selling pressure in select index heavyweights also dragged the indices lower.

Positive global cues pushed the indices higher during the early trade, but the expiry of weekly derivative series increased the volatility at Dalal Street. Analysts expect the street to remain range-bound in the near future.

For the day, BSE Sensex dropped 316.94 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 61,002.57. The Nifty50 declined 91.65 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 17,944.20. Broader markets tanked in tandem with the headline peers as BSE midcap and smallcap declined about per cent, each. India VIX jumped about 2 per cent to the 13.08 level.



Markets witnessed turbulence on the back of weak global cues as investors booked profit in banking, IT and telecom stocks. Rising inflation, US bond yields, and dollar index are once again creating a lot of uncertainty amongst investors, said Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice-President - Technical Research at Kotak Securities.



""For the bulls, 17,900-17,800 would act as a key support zone while 50-day SMA or 18,100 and 18,200 could be the immediate hurdle. On the flip side, the selling pressure could accelerate if the index slips below 17,800 and in case of further correction, it could slip to 17,700-17,650,"" he said.



All the sectors of Nifty settled in red for the day. Nifty Realty and PSU Bank indices plunged 2 per cent each. Nifty IT, Private Bank and Pharma indices over a per cent, each. Financial services, metal and media indices dropped about a per cent, each.

Among the Adani Group stocks, Adani Enterprises dropped more than 4 per cent as the Supreme Court refused to accept the Centre’s suggestion in a sealed cover. Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas hit lower circuits of 5 per cent, respectively. ACC also settled in the red.

Among the gainers, Adani Wilmar, NDTV and Adani Power hit upper circuits of 5 per cent, each. Adani Green Energy and Ambuja Cement rose 2 per cent. Adani Ports also managed to settle with gains.

Barring the Adani Group stocks, Nestle India declined more than 3 per cent after December quarter earnings. IndusInd Bank and SBI Life Insurance dropped 3 per cent each. HDFC Life, Mahindra & Mahindra, State Bank of India, Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies shed 2 per cent, each.

On the contrary, Larsen & Toubro jumped over 2 per cent, whereas Ultratech Cement, Bharat Petroleum and Hero MotoCorp gained 2 per cent, each. Asian Paints, Coal India and Grasim Industries added a per cent, each, during the day.

A lack of major triggers in the domestic market is attracting global cues to dictate the market trend. The US market is facing an unfavorable combination of higher-than-expected inflation and a stronger job market, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.



""The PPI (Producer Price Index) in the US came in at 6 per cent, in contrast to the expectation of 5.4 per cent. This suggests that interest rates have not yet peaked and will remain elevated for a long period,"" he said.



A total of 3,590 stocks traded for the day on BSE, of which 1,943 ended the day with cuts, while 1,503 settled higher. The remaining 144 stocks ended unchanged. A total of 154 stocks hit an upper circuit on BSE, whereas 203 stocks hit the lower circuit during the trading session.

In the broader markets, Shilpa Medicare surged over 14 per cent after the company's Bengaluru facility for the manufacture and testing of Orodispersible films and Transdermal systems was successfully registered with the Ministry of Health, United Arab Emirates.

TCNS Clothings jumped more than 12 per cent to Rs 496.90. EKI Energy Services jumped, broke a series of lower circuits and hit an upper circuit of 10 per cent. PTC Industries jumped 9 per cent as its subsidiary received an order from Safran Aircraft Engines. Elecon Constructions and Nelcast were up 9 per cent, each.

On the contrary, Kabra Extrusiontechnik plunged over 6 per cent. Arihant Capital Markets and Parag Milk Foods plunged about 6 per cent each. CarTrade, Sadbhav Engineering, Antony Waste Handling were down 5 per cent, each.

A total of 13 out of 15 sectoral indices on NSE settled in the red. Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial Services and Nifty Oil & Gas underperformed the NSE Nifty by falling 1.05 per cent, 0.98 per cent and 1.14 per cent, respectively.

In his fresh attack on the Narendra Modi-led government at the centre, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi questioned why the Adani Group was given contracts despite the fact that they lacked prior experiences.

In the video, Rahul Gandhi goes on to allege that Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over six airports to the Adani group under Public Private Partnership in 2018.

Then a year later, the Indian government handed over Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, and Jaipur to the Adani Group. Gandhi also shared a poster of PM Modi with Gautam Adani.

“I spoke the truth in Parliament about the ties between PM Modi and Adani. With evidence, I spoke on how India's wealth is being looted. This truth was expunged from Parliament records"", Rahul Gandhi said, referring to his Lok Sabha speech on 8 February.

During his Lok Sabha speech, Rahul Gandhi had alleged that the Modi government changed certain laws in favour of Adani, who hails from the PM's home state of Gujarat.

“Why were six airports handed over to one company? Finance Ministry, NITI Aayog, AAI raised objections. By whom and why was it overruled? Concession lease was for 30 years, why was it increased to 50 years for Adani?"", Gandhi asked.

Meanwhile, posing a set of three questions to the government on the Adani issue as part of the party's 'Hum Adani Ke Hain Kaun (HAHK)' series, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said following the Hindenburg report, the world's biggest stock index provider MSCI announced that it would reduce the weightage of Adani Group stocks in its indices in the coming months.

The second largest provider, S&P Dow Jones, stated that it would remove Adani Enterprises from its sustainablity indices, while the third largest, FTSE Russell, announced it would make changes to the weightage of Adani Group companies in its indices effective March 20, he said.

""Should the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) not be trying to protect retail investors by at least ensuring that suspect companies' positions in key indices are reviewed?"" the Congress leader asked.

He also claimed that far from reviewing the inclusion of Adani Enterprises in the Nifty 50, the NSE announced on February 17 that four more Adani Group companies would be included in the NSE indices.

The Opposition has been demanding a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into allegations against Adani by US-based agency Hindenburg.

The 67 days long deadlock between the truck operators’ union and the Adani group-owned cement plants in Himachal Pradesh’s Barmana and Darlaghat over freight charges ended on Monday after the intervention of Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.

In a meeting held in Shimla, chaired by the Chief Minister, both sides agreed on the freight rates, and the company management assured to resume cement production from February 21.

The operations at cement plants situated at Barmana in Bilaspur district and Darlaghat in Solan district were closed by the company in December 2022, amid a dispute over freight charges between the truck operators and the company.

“Both the cement management companies and the truck operators have settled upon the new rates which will be ₹10.30 per kilometre per metric tonne for single-axle and ₹9.30 per kilometre per metric tonne for multi-axle. The factory management has given its consent to resume the cement production from tomorrow and truck operators have also agreed to transport at these rates,” said Mr. Sukhu.

“It’s due to the coordinated efforts of all, an acceptable solution to this matter has been possible. This dispute erupted soon after our government assumed power and the cement factory management announced to stop the production. Truck operators had gone on strike on December 16, 2022. Thereafter, the State government continued to hold talks with truck operators and factory management. After the change of ownership of the cement factories located at Darlaghat and Barmana, the management refused to provide freight at the old rates and from here the dispute escalated,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that both parties suffered a loss due to the stalemate, besides other stakeholders. “We arrived at a consensus, thereby protecting the interests of both the truck operators unions and the management as well, besides the welfare of all others who were being directly or indirectly hit by the stalemate,” said Mr. Sukhu.","In a meeting held in Shimla, chaired by the Chief Minister, both sides agreed on the freight rates, and the company management assured to resume cement production from February 21.

He hailed Balkrishna for reviving Patanjali from a sick company to a firm with a turnover of ₹40,000 crore this financial year due to his professional governance, transparent management and accountability. The dream of making India 'param vaibhavshali' can be achieved by creating empires like Patanjali, he said.

Earlier, Ramdev had claimed that cancer cases has increased in India after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, denying his claim, medical experts said there was no correlation between the two and the rise in cases was a normal phenomenon.

While speaking before a gathering at Miramar beach in Goa where his Patanjali Yog Samiti had organised a yoga camp, Ramdev said, “Cancer has increased a lot. The cases of this disease have gone up after the COVID-19 pandemic. People have lost their eyesight, their sense of hearing…."" Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant was also present with him on the stage.

Prior to that, on 4 February, Ramdev had sparked a controversy wherein he had accused Muslims of resorting to terror and abducting Hindu women while comparing Hinduism to Islam and Christianity. In a gathering in Barmer, Rajasthan, Baba Ramdev had alleged that the two faiths were obsessed with conversion while Hinduism taught its followers to do good.

The Wire,,'Was PM Modi Directly Involved in Adani's Bangladesh Power Deal?: TMC MP Asks EAM,https://thewire.in/government/adani-bangladesh-modi-jawhar-sircar-jaishankar,"Jaishankar, Narendra Modi, Gautam Adani and Jawhar Sircar. Photos: Official Twitter accounts of all four. Advertisement...",None,'Was PM Modi Directly Involved in Adani's Bangladesh Power Deal?: TMC MP Asks EAM,"New Delhi: Trinamool Congress MP Jawhar Sircar has written thrice to external affairs minister S. Jaishankar, requesting that he reveal if Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “himself steering” a power purchase agreement for coal-based supply between Bangladesh and the Adani group.

Sircar wrote the letters in the wake of reports that Bangladesh officials have “expressed unease” about the agreement. Since then, there have been recent allegations of stock manipulation and fraud against the Adani group.

Sircar has also commented in the letters on this “patently unfair PPA (power purchase agreement)” and its ability to trigger a “major anti-India groundswell” in Bangladesh.

Talking to The Wire, Sircar said there has been no response to any of them and that he only decided to make these public after giving the minister “a fair chance”.

MP first wrote in December following WaPo report

In his first letter on the subject, sent on December 13, 2022, Sircar had, while mentioning a report in The Washington Post, headlined ‘How political will often favors a coal billionaire and his dirty fossil fuel,’ pointed out that it spoke of the “special efforts put in by the Prime Minister himself during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015 for a $4.5 billion deal that was signed for India to sell electricity to Bangladesh”.

The Rajya Sabha MP had added that “the report mentions of a $1.7 billion, 1600 MW coal powered plant of the Adani group in Godda district of Jharkhand and how the Washington Post has accessed and analysed the 163-page Power Purchase Agreement”.

He had further brought to the notice of the EAM that the report said that the PPA “mandates that Bangladesh must pay Adani approximately $450 mn a year in capacity and maintenance charges – regardless of whether it generates any electricity. It further mentions that Bangladesh has 40% more power generation than the peak demand and that it would have to buy Adani’s electricity at more than five times the market price of bulk electricity in the country.”

‘Statements providing handle to strong anti-India elements’

The TMC MP had further raised concerns about how “these statements provide a handle to the strong anti-India elements in our neighbouring country” and pointed out that “our [India’s] relationship with Bangladesh is extremely sensitive and such adverse reports circulated in the run-up to elections are the stuff of agitations.”

He had also urged the EAM for a response. On not getting one, Sircar wrote another letter to Jaishankar on January 31, 2023. This was soon after allegations against the Adani group were levelled in the Hindenburg Research report.

As there was still no reply, Sircar in his February 13 letter to the EAM pointed out that “no reply has come. He also wrote that “Adani-related matter are now in the eye of the public storm, and this aspect of his patently unfair PPA with Bangladesh may be triggering a major anti-India groundswell”.

‘Items, documents indicate PM steered deal’

The MP said “there are items and documents to indicate that PM was himself steering this deal/project from his first post-election visit to Dhaka.”

He added that at a later stage, the EAM was “actively involved in pushing this Adani deal through”.

Urging the minister to comment on the matter, Sircar said “we need to know the official version on whether this patently-unfair deal, leading to disaffection in Bangladesh, was actively supported by India or not” and if “MEA did not intervene in Adani’s profiteering at the cost of or relations with Bangladesh”.

MEA distanced itself from deal after Bangladesh sought revision

After the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) earlier this month demanded a revision of the 2017 agreement to buy electricity from the 1600 MW plant of the Adani Power Limited located at Godda, the Union government had distanced itself from the deal.

On being asked about the matter, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had told journalists: “I understand you are referring to a deal between a sovereign government and an Indian company.” On being pressed to state the government’s position in the matter, he had added: “I do not think we are involved in this”.","Sircar wrote the letters in the wake of reports that Bangladesh officials have “expressed unease” about the agreement.

And what is the reason for his optimism? Hear it from him

In 2006, I researched and wrote a paper for the Cato Institute on Gujarat's new strategy of port-based development . This strategy was launched by Congress chief minister Chimanbhai Patel in the early 1990s and expanded by BJP successors. I visited Gautam Adani 's new Mundra port and was struck by its high automation and speed. I was astounded to hear that it financially compensated any ship that was not admitted and unloaded on schedule. While working in Mumbai in 1990, I had seen ships wait 20 days for port entry. So, Mundra seemed to be on another planet.The Hindenburg Research report has alleged vast price rigging and fraud by Adani companies. The charges are serious. Global investors have stampeded out of Adani shares. We need a thorough investigation, and punishment of the guilty.Let me raise a separate linked issue. Adani's critics say he shot to riches not through skills but manipulation and political favours, minting money in cosy monopolies. I disagree. Going from humble origins to global No. 3 in two decades is impossible without exceptional business skills.Critics accuse BJP of 'giving' Adani valuable assets , from ports and mines to airports and transmission lines. No. What the government initially gave Adani was the right to operate a minor port in the Kutch desert without even a rail connection. To convert this desert patch into India's largest port is close to miraculous.Adani has also acquired jetties and ports in a dozen other locations, beating global giants like Maersk and Dubai World in competitive auctions. He is incomparably India's top port operator, handling an estimated quarter of total Indian freight. This makes him a national champion.So, GoI is backing him to acquire strategic jetties and ports in Sri Lanka and Israel. Critics call this a favour. Really? The Sri Lanka terminal will cost $750 million and Haifa Port $1.18 billion. No Indian rival would dare risk so much even if offered on a platter. Adani's skills have made him a strategic player, more than just a businessman.A port is no cosy monopoly. It has to compete in logistics and pricing to woo ships from established rivals. Mundra's logistics have attracted business investments of thousands of crores, creating an industrial hub in the desert. It has the world's largest automated coal-handling facility. A 2017 Morgan Stanley report puts Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) in the top 25% of global port companies.Critics focus on government favours to Adani. In India, business success requires good management of not only factories but politics too. All businessmen cosy up to politicians. But while this opens doors and overcomes some rules, it cannot guarantee success. Anil Ambani is often accused by Rahul Gandhi of getting ₹30,000 crore in defence deals. Yet, he has flopped commercially.Once, Dhirubhai Ambani was also accused of political manipulation and boondoggles. He responded, 'What have I done that every other businessman has not?' There was no reply. Other businessmen, many with formidable historical advantages, had also wooed politicians and fiddled books. For a newcomer like Dhirubhai to beat the old giants at their own game signified immense talent. Something similar can be said of Adani.Dhirubhai's dubious acts are detailed in Hamish McDonald's 1998 book, The Polyester Prince. But critics are dead wrong to think that he was just a successful manipulator. During the licence-permit raj, manipulation was inescapable. But once the economy was liberalised, he built the world's largest export-oriented oil refinery with operating margins higher than even Singapore's famed refineries, proving himself world class. He got favours in telecom but created the cheapest telephone network in the world. Those who focus only on his manipulation are blind to the phenomenal skills that made him a historical titan , warts and all. Adani is treading a similar path.Critics say Adani deals mainly in infrastructure where cosiness to the government matters more than true skills. No. Dozens of new tycoons with strong regional political clout joined the infrastructure boom of 2003-08. But despite having political godfathers, many ran into trouble and went bust, leaving banks with enormous unpaid debts. Success in infrastructure requires skill, not just political friends.Readers may think I am a great Adani fan. But I do not own any Adani company shares because of high prices and high risk. Adani has been diversifying and expanding at breakneck speed using borrowed money, bidding very high prices in auctions and acquisitions. This facilitates fast expansion, but carries great risks. History has examples aplenty of business titans who diversified crazily to create giant conglomerates, succeeded for a few decades amid applause, but eventually came a cropper (like General Electric under Jack Welch).So, I think the Hindenburg report may be the best thing that ever happened to Adani. It will slow his speed of expansion and diversification, and force his financiers to be diligent and cautious in future. This could impose highly desirable financial discipline on Adani, to his own benefit. Hindenburg may have been a blessing in disguise - or, in Winston Churchill's words in response to his wife trying to cheer him up after his post-war electoral defeat, a blessing 'quite effectively disguised'.One day I might actually buy Adani shares.","Swami Speaks: Dhirubhai Ambani had beaten old school business boys, Adani probably better at it The Hindenburg report may be the ""best thing"" that ever happened to billionaire Gautam Adani, says Swaminathan Aiyar.

This is India’s largest green energy company.

This decision was announced by the company management in its post-third quarter results call with its bond holders.

“Short-term capex (12-18 months) is being reviewed. In the near term, there will be a slow down in our target. We will revisit our discretionary capex and reduce our capex in the near term,” the management said in the call with fixed-income investors on February 16, according to the newspaper.

“The capex number that is being talked about is still under review. A larger part of this capacity can be in the form of discretionary capex,” the company also said.

The Adani group and all its companies have been under scrutiny ever since US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the group of large-scale stock manipulation and accounting fall, leading to a dramatic fall in share values. Last week, Adani Power announced that it would not be going through with its planned purchase of DB Power, even though it had made the winning bid close to a year ago. Adani Road Transport has also said some investment commitments in new road projects are on hold.

Recently, ratings agency Moody’s had changed Adani Green Energy’s outlook to negative because of the company’s “large capital spending program and dependence on sponsor support potentially in the form of subordinated debt or shareholder loans”, Business Standard reported.","New Delhi: Adani Green Energy has decided to review its capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 10,000 crore for the upcoming financial year (2023-24), Business Standard reported.

Will it...",None,"Adani, Rafale, Pegasus and the Question of What Concerns the Indian Voter","Last week, a Congress spokesperson asked me whether the Adani issue would matter at all to the ordinary voter. Clearly, he had some self-doubt as to how the campaign against Gautam Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would play out politically and electorally.

Will it affect Modi’s popularity?

Sections of the Congress party may be grappling with this question, especially after Rahul Gandhi upped the ante dramatically with his captivating speech in the Lok Sabha on the unique relationship between Gautam Adani and PM Modi. A large part of the speech stands expunged, showing that the issue is troubling Modi. But Modi has also shown the capacity to repeatedly emerge politically unscathed, and this causes self-doubt in the opposition camp.

On an earlier occasion, similar self-doubts were expressed by sections of the Congress when Rahul Gandhi had relentlessly campaigned against Modi’s handling of the Rafale deal. Even then, some opposition leaders felt that Modi was seen as personally incorruptible, so simply attacking him with corruption charges would not help. The same logic was used when the Pegasus issue exploded in parliament and a whole session was nearly washed out. How will the Pegasus issue impact the voter in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or Rajasthan?

So the larger question is as follows ― should the opposition choose issues for political campaigning based purely on how they would play out electorally and how much they would impact Modi’s image? If this is the dominant consideration for doing opposition politics then it would be severely self-limiting, and even self-defeating.

Politics cannot work on such a narrow and instrumental basis.

True, Modi has a certain teflon quality, something they used to say about Atal Bihari Vajpayee, too. Many corruption scams in Vajpayee’s time did not stick to him personally. But that did not dissuade the Opposition from campaigning on those issues. Of course Vajpayee’s government was less centralised, which helped the Prime Minister’s Office to deflect the blame to coalition partners. It was then widely believed that Pramod Mahajan was the party’s chief fund collector and Vajpayee’s policy was to keep some distance from those activities.

But nothing is static in politics. Vajpayee did lose power in spite of retaining much of his aura of personal incorruptibility. So the opposition would do well not to get intimidated by what seems like Modi’s impenetrable teflon image. More importantly, it is the opposition’s dharma to campaign around issues without always weighing the outcome in terms of electoral dividends. In politics, outcomes generally don’t build up in a linear fashion. A lot of things accumulate in the electorate’s deeper consciousness before manifesting all at once.

So every issue which rightfully deserves intense campaigning must be taken up, irrespective of immediate electoral gains. Rafale was a big issue because it was apparent that all established procedures for defence procurement sanctified by the cabinet and the President of India were upended overnight. Corruption is not just about taking bribes. It is also about how established institutions are deliberately weakened and destroyed.

On Modi’s policy to actively help in the expansion of big business entities, the issue is not whether he has personally benefited from his close links with such businesses. It is more about how such a nexus with big business impacts democracy and key democratic institutions.

The opposition needs to properly nuance its messaging by suggesting that one need not be personally financially corrupt to perpetuate oneself in power by cornering over 85% of all big business funding in favour of one party. The people who vote and care for India’s democracy will eventually understand this logic. It is therefore not all about whether a leader is amassing personal wealth or not.

It seems like a no-brainer that the campaign around Modi’s nexus with big business has to be directly linked to the opaque manner in which electoral bonds are funding Indian politics. Hopefully, at some stage, the voter will clearly understand what is at stake. It would be meaningless for the opposition to sit back and speculate how quickly the voter might respond to such campaigns. The opposition must do what is right. It is as simple as that.","Last week, a Congress spokesperson asked me whether the Adani issue would matter at all to the ordinary voter.

UK overtakes India as world’s sixth-biggest equity market after 9 months, says report","The UK has surpassed India as the world’s sixth-largest equity market for the first time since May 2022 as a weaker pound boosts appeal of exporters and jitters over Adani-Hindenburg row are being felt across Indian markets, said a report on Wednesday.

The combined market capitalisation of primary listings in the UK, excluding ETFs and ADRs, reached about $3.11 trillion on Tuesday, $5.1 billion higher than their Indian equivalents, which hasn’t happened since May 29, 2022, said Bloomberg.

UK’s FTSE 350 Index — which comprises stocks in the FTSE 100 and the domestically focused FTSE 250 — has gained 5.9% so far this year. Meanwhile, Nifty 50 has fallen 3.5% so far in 2023.

India’s equity market is facing a double whammy of a weaker rupee and the massive fallout of the stock rout being witnessed by Adani Group firms ever since US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research released a scathing report against the conglomerate.

The January 24 report by Hindenburg Research alleged the conglomerate improperly used offshore tax havens and manipulated stocks, which the conglomerate denied. The report also flagged concerns over its high debt levels. The listed Adani stocks lost a combined market capitalisation of over whopping $140 billion due to the damning report by Hindenburg.

Adani has repeatedly denied the claims and has also cut expenses and repaid debt as he seeks to calm traders concerned about the group’s access to financing.

BSE's m-cap stood at Rs 261 lakh crore on Wednesday, after losing over 4% m-cap to Adani stock rout since late January.

“The negative Adani headlines have caused some concerns among international investors, but they’re mainly focused on the group,” Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at Zurich-based GAM Investments told Bloomberg. “This could cause investors to be more selective in India, but we are not seeing investors avoiding Indian stocks in general.”

Benchmark Sensex tanked 927 points while the broader Nifty settled at a four-month low on Wednesday due to an intense selling in heavyweight stocks triggered by geopolitical and inflation concerns.

Losses in global equities and across-the-board selling ahead of the monthly expiry of derivatives also hit the investor sentiment, dragging down the key indices for a fourth straight day.

The BSE Sensex tumbled 927.74 points or 1.53 per cent to settle at 59,744.98, the lowest closing level since February 1. As many as 29 of the Sensex stocks declined. During the day, it tanked 991.17 points or 1.63 per cent to 59,681.55.

The 50-issue NSE Nifty declined 272.40 points or 1.53 per cent to end at a four-month low of 17,554.30 with 47 of its constituents ending in the red.

As per a report on Wednesday, the market regulator has likely sought details of all the ratings from credit rating agencies on local loans and securities of Adani companies. By end of February 22nd, Adani firms' market valuation dropped by 70% from its peak level.

As Adani firms embattle allegations of the Hindenburg report in court, last week, it looks like the rating companies were asked by Sebi to share the information including all outstanding ratings, outlook, and possible updates from any discussions with Adani Group officials.

A person aware of the communication from the regulator told Economic Times, ""Sebi is probably trying to ascertain whether the sharp fall in stock prices of several Adani companies would have any bearing on the liquidity positions and the debt repayment capability of the borrowing companies... Most of this information, however, is in public domain.""

On Wednesday, investors saw the destruction of ₹40,000 crore of wealth in Adani stocks. All of the Adani stocks were in the red.

The market valuation of Adani group companies together is now down 70% from its peak, from around Rs.25 lakh crore to 7.55 lakh crore.

Post the release of US-based short seller Hindenburg's bombshell report on 24 January, the shares of Adani Group shares have lost 60% of their value.

Adani Enterprises on Wednesday dipped by over 10.4% to end at ₹1,404.85 apiece. Adani Ports dipped by 6.25% to end at ₹546.85 apiece. The rest of Adani named stocks had hit the day's lowest limit and froze around those levels.

Adani Wilmar stock froze at a 5% lower circuit at ₹390.35 apiece, while Adani Total Gas also touched a 5% lower circuit to close at ₹834.95 apiece. Similarly, at 5% lower circuit each, Adani Green Energy, Adani Transmission, and Adani Power ended at ₹539.30 apiece, ₹788.75 apiece, and ₹162.60 apiece respectively.

Adani's newly added media arm, NDTV share price ended at ₹201.90 apiece down 4.18% on BSE. While cement business too faced massive disruption, with Ambuja Cements stock closing at ₹335.55 apiece lower by 4.92%, and ACC stock at ₹1,752.35 apiece below 4.13%.

The sharp selloff in Adani stocks dragged broader markets as well. Sensex shed 927.74 points or 1.53% to end at 59,744.98. While Nifty 50 dipped by 272.40 points or 1.53% to close at 17,554.30.

Also, the MSCI India Index slid as much as nearly 2% in the day, taking its losses from a December 1, 2022 peak to more than 10%. Adani stocks were the biggest laggards.

Last week, while rejigging indexes, NSE added two Adani stocks namely Adani Wilmar and Adani Power to its Nifty Next 50 Index and Nifty Next 500 Index, respectively from March 31, 2023. While reports have stated that three Adani Group companies – Adani Power, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Transmission – are expected to be removed from the MSCI India index during the rebalancing exercise in May following a sharp correction in their stock prices.

Also, FTSE Russel confirmed that it intends to proceed with the scheduled index review changes for Adani Group (India) and its associated securities. Earlier, FTSE added 10 Indian stocks to its Global Large-cap index as part of its semi-annual index review, but no action was taken on Adani stocks.","As per a report on Wednesday, the market regulator has likely sought details of all the ratings from credit rating agencies on local loans and securities of Adani companies.

People cited above told ET that the group has begun talks with several large high-yield global credit funds, and has so far received two indicative term sheets from potential lenders. ""The group is trying to raise the funds against the cash flows of NQXT with an objective to upstream the funds for further payments elsewhere,"" said one of the persons cited above.Lenders engaged with the group include hedge fund Farallon Capital , among others.The spokespersons of Adani group and Farallon Capital declined to comment.To be sure, this is not the not first time that the group has tried to raise funds against the asset. Corporate filings showed NQXT had debt repayments worth $500 million maturing in December last year, which reports suggest were paid via internal accruals and cash infusion by the promoters due to lack of refinancing options.""Cash flows of the port have improved significantly in the last one year, and it has an EBITDA (operating profit) of around AUD 200 million (equivalent to Rs 1,115 crore),"" said a second person close to the development.NQXT owns and operates a 50 million tonnes per annum coal export terminal under a long-term lease from the Queensland state government. The lease runs until 2110. The terminal is located 25km north of Bowen in northern Queensland. In September, Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on NQXT to stable from negative and affirmed the 'BB+' rating.""It has, however, been a persistent problem to fund the port from conventional sources because of accompanying environmental concerns around it but things are different with special situations and hedge funds as they do not have very rigid lending norms,"" added the second person cited above.The move to raise relatively expensive capital from hedge funds highlights a sense of urgency in the Adani Group, which is trying to garner at least $1 billion in the coming weeks to meet any exigency that may arise due to a continuing decline in stock prices of the group companies and the scheduled $500-million loan repayment due in March - part of last year's acquisition financing of ACC and Ambuja Cements for $6.4 billion.Cash flows of the group's operating companies are expected to be enough to meet repayment obligations, but analysts are circumspect about the promoter debt of the group. While the exact amount owed by the promoters is not known, it is estimated to be upwards of $2 billion and largely owed to foreign banks.

However, the valuation guru also said that it shows bad business practice and not con as alleged in the US-based short seller Hindenburg report.

“The Adani Group collectively carries about three times as much debt as it should, confirming that the group is over-levered, but note that this is bad business practice, not a con,"" Damodaran said.

Damodaran argued that the cost of capital shows that there is little, if any, benefit in terms of value added to Adani from using debt, and significant downside risk unless the debt is being subsidized by someone (government, sloppy bankers, green bondholders).

On Adani Group's flagship company, Damodaran said, ""Adani Enterprise carries too much debt, with an actual debt of 413,443 million more than double its optimal debt of 185,309 million, and reducing its debt load will not just lower its risk of failure, but also lower its cost of capital.""

This company, the professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business said, is part of a family group, where higher debt at one of the Adani companies may be offset by less debt at another.

Meanwhile, Adani Group said that it plans to prepay or repay share-backed loans worth $690 million to $790 million by March-end, Reuters reported.

The plan comes even as the group holds a fixed-income roadshow this week in Singapore and Hong Kong to shore up investor confidence amid share price falls and a regulatory probe.

Adani Green Energy Ltd also plans to refinance its 2024 bonds via an $800 million, three-year credit line.

The group presented both plans to bondholders in Hong Kong on Tuesday, the people said. The three-day roadshow is scheduled to end on Wednesday.

Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh told Bloomberg News the group is not looking to refinance debt or raise capital.

Seven listed Adani group companies have lost more than $140 billion in market value since a 24 January report by Hindenburg Research alleged stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens, and flagged concerns over debt levels.

Adani has rejected the allegations and denied wrongdoing.

India's largest insurer LIC has also seen a significant impact for its large exposure towards Adani firms. The insurer's stock has taken a massive blow since the Hindenburg accused Gautam Adani and his port-to-energy empire of stock manipulation and frauds. In a month, the LIC stock has nosedived by nearly 17% on Dalal Street and its shareholding value in Adani stocks has declined by more than ₹48,600 crore.

As per BSE data, LIC held 4,81,74,654 equity shares, or 4.23%, in the group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises as on December 31, 2022. The government-owned life insurer held 4,06,76,207 equity shares, or 3.65% stake, in Adani Transmission during the same quarter; 6,55,88,170 equity shares, or 5.96%, in Adani Total Gas; and 2,03,09,080 equity shares or 1.28% in Adani Green Energy.

LIC also has some exposure to Adani's cement business. The insurer holds 12,55,89,263 equity shares or 6.33% in Ambuja Cements and 1,20,33,271 equity shares or 6.41% in ACC.

But LIC's largest holding in Adani-related stocks are in Adani Ports. The insurer has 19,75,26,194 equity shares or 9.14% in Adani Ports.

LIC does not have any holding in Adani Wilmar, Adani Power, and NDTV.

The data is from BSE and as of December 31, 2022.

Taking into consideration, the market price of Adani stocks on January 24th, LIC's shareholding in Adani Enterprises was valued at around ₹16585.33 crore; in Adani Ports it was around ₹15,028.78 crore; in Adani Transmission it was ₹11,210.97 crore; in Adani Total Gas it was ₹25,483.96 crore; and in Adani Green Energy it was ₹3,886.24 crore.

While in Ambuja Cements, LIC's holding valued at around ₹6,261.25 crore, and in ACC around ₹2,811.21 crore.

In total, LIC's shareholding in Adani stocks as of January 24 was around ₹81,267.75 crore.

But on the same day, things were about to change drastically for Adani's conglomerate and many would be left baffled. On January 24th, Hindenburg dropped a critical report, alleging that Gautam Adani's group has committed fraud, stock manipulation, and tax evasion among others.

Hindenburg's January 24th report said, ""we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the ₹17.8 trillion (U.S. $218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.""

The short seller had claimed that the 7 Adani named stocks are more than 85% overvalued.

And then began a series of free falls in Adani stocks. A month later, the panic selling still continues in Adani shares. By end of February 24th, Adani Group's market value together has slipped by over ₹12 lakh crore in a month.

Before January 24th, Adani stocks together held the alpha seat on stock exchanges with a market valuation of over ₹19 lakh crore, surpassing Mukesh Ambani's Reliance and Ratan Tata's TCS.

Why LIC was impacted by the Adani-Hindenburg row? The answer is simple it is because of the exposure LIC has in Adani stocks. Although on January 30th, LIC had stated it has ₹35,917 crore under equity and debt at the end of December in Adani Group stocks. LIC had said, the total purchase value of equity under all Adani group companies is ₹30,127 crore.

By end of February 24th, LIC's shareholding value in Adani stocks was around ₹32,618.56 crore. Hence, in total, the shareholding value of LIC in Adani stocks declined by ₹48,649.17 crore from January 24 to February 24th.

LIC's biggest loss would be in Adani Total Gas as its shareholding value dipped by ₹20,541.23 crore in a month. Its shareholding value plunged by ₹10,251.57 crore in Adani Enterprises, ₹3,988.05 crore in Adani Ports, ₹8,315.23 crore in Adani Transmission, ₹2,897.69 crore in Adani Green Energy, ₹1,925.28 crore in Ambuja Cements and by ₹730.12 crore in ACC.

In a month, Adani Enterprises' share price has tumbled by nearly 62%, Adani Ports dipped over 26.5%, Adani Transmission plunged by over 74%, Adani Total Gas slipped by nearly 81%, and Adani Green Energy by over 74.5%. Ambuja and ACC share prices have also shed nearly 31% and 26%.

The Central government led by Narendra Modi is handing over the country’s wealth to the Adani Group, in the same way that the British East India Company had taken it away from India, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said while addressing his party’s 85th plenary session on Sunday.

Warning that ‘history is repeating itself’, Mr. Gandhi said that “Modi ji and Adani ji are one” and that was why the Opposition was not allowed to ask questions about business tycoon Gautam Adani in Parliament. He then asserted that he would continue to ask question about Mr. Adani until the truth came out.

The former Congress chief also urged the party leadership to formulate a new plan to carry forward the “ tapasya (penance)“ undertaken through the Bharat Jodo Yatra, indicating that another yatra could be on the cards, along the east-west route this time.

Kashmiri impact

Mr. Gandhi’s focus in the 50-minute-long speech, addressing 17,000-odd delegates, was divided between the Bharat Jodo Yatra (BJY) and the Adani group.

Talking about the Jammu & Kashmir leg of the BJY, the Congress leader said that the yatra had made Kashmiri youth carry the national flag, even in terrorism-infested districts like Pulwama and Anantnag.

“I heard the Prime Minister say in Parliament that he had also hoisted the national flag in Lal Chowk. India’s Prime Minister didn’t understand the difference. Narendra Modi ji along with 15-20 BJP people hoisted the flag. Bharat Jodo Yatra made lakhs of Kashmiri youth hoist the tricolour,” he said.

‘Cowardice’

Mr Gandhi also took on the BJP’s nationalism plank by referring to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s recent statement that as China was a big economy, it was common sense not to pick a fight with it.

“When the British ruled us, was their economy smaller than ours? Do you not fight if someone is stronger than you? There is a word for this: cowardice. This is [Vinayak Damodar] Savarkar’s ideology, to bow down before the powerful. An Indian Minister is telling China, ‘your economy is bigger and we can’t fight with you’. Do you call this nationalism? What kind of patriotism is this?” he asked.

In the second half of his speech, the Congress leader made a focussed attack on the Adani group and its relations with Mr. Modi and his government.

The Adani connection

“When we asked in Parliament, ‘what is the Prime Minister’s relation with Adani’, our entire speech is expunged. [Mallikarjun] Kharge ji’s entire speech was expunged. We will ask in Parliament thousands of times till the truth of Adani ji is out, we will not stop,” Mr. Gandhi said, amid applause.

Repeating many of the points that he had raised in the Lok Sabha, the Congress leader questioned how Mr. Adani rose from the 609th to the second spot on the global billionaires list; asked how India’s foreign policy helped the Adani Group in countries like Israel, Australia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh; and expressed concerns about alleged shell companies, especially given the Adani Group’s involvement in the defence sector and other key sectors like airports, ports, agriculture and agricultural storage.

He also questioned why several Union Ministers had to come to the defence of one businessman. “I had asked a simple question on Modi ji and Adani ji’s relationship . The simple answer could have been ‘there is no relation’. But there is a relation. Adani ji and Modi are one,” Mr. Gandhi said.

“I want to tell the people who work for Adani ji’s company that their company is hurting the country and it is snatching the entire infrastructure of country,” Mr. Gandhi said. “Remember that the freedom struggle started against the East India Company and that too was a company. History is being repeated. This is against the country and if that happens, the entire Congress party will stand against it,” he added.

After Mr. Gandhi’s all-out attack on the Adani Group, Congress general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal announced that the party would undertake a series of programmes to “expose the Modi government’s link with the corporate group”.","Warning that ‘history is repeating itself’, Mr. Gandhi said that “Modi ji and Adani ji are one” and that was why the Opposition was not allowed to ask questions about business tycoon Gautam Adani in Parliament.

The largest integrated domestic transport utility said it crossed 300 million metric tonnes of cargo handling on February 23, in just 329 days, beating its own milestone from last year's 354 days.

Following the business update, the scrip rose 2.32 per cent to Rs 571.95.

In a filing to BSE, Adani Ports said it has registered unprecedented growth since it started operations over two decades ago and continues to outperform all India cargo volume growth, with its market share rising rapidly.

CEO and Whole Time Director Karan Adani said: ""The APSEZ’s flagship port, Mundra, is outpacing all its closest rivals by comfortable margins and continues to be the largest port in the nation in terms of volumes handled.”

The Adani group company said increase in cargo volume handled at its ports is a sign that the nation’s economy is picking up. Almost 95 per cent of the trade volumes in India are carried through maritime transport, it noted.

""Having world-class mega ports is imperative for the Indian coastline. Through concession agreements with various government authorities, APSEZ has strategically built a string of ports (pearls) across the coastline of India along with ICDs (inland container depots) and warehouses, woven intricately with self-owned rakes, covering more than 70 per cent of the hinterland,"" Adani Ports said.

Adani Ports said it has seen 4 per cent YoY growth at its container terminals because of its efficient infrastructure.

""The engagement with container lines and the resolve to deliver on commitments has led to more new services at APSEZ terminals, raising volumes. Mundra Port shipped 1,501 fertiliser rakes in the current fiscal year with the total cargo dispatch of 4.8 MMT – the highest ever in the port’s history,"" Adani Ports said.

Adani Ports said the ongoing year has seen growth in agri exports due to India’s record high food grain production and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

""Mundra Port registered a record RO-RO exports – an increase of 18 per cent largely due to long-time customer, Maruti Suzuki India. Hazira has been continuously witnessing sustained growth in chemical volumes YoY due to its proximity to the chemical hub of India. It has seen a 16 per cent growth this year,"" Adani Ports said.

Adani Ports and SEZ (APSEZ), which has 13 ports across India with >600 million tonnes (mnt) total capacity, has demonstrated its ability to successfully construct /acquire assets in India and create significant value for stakeholders, said JM Financial in a report.

Meanwhile, Jefferies also has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of ₹800 in a base case scenario. The brokerage expects the company's consolidated volume CAGR over FY22-25E to come in at 14%; 13x EV/EBITDA Sept'24E. The gradual monetization of SEZ is also expected over 20 years.

“On the back of aggressive expansion in logistics (container/bulk/ warehousing), APSEZ is transforming into India’s largest integrated transport utility, providing end-to-end logistics solutions to its enormous customer base,"" the JM Financial report said.

The insurance major’s stock closed at ₹567.75, down 2.9 per cent on the BSE, as its exposure to Adani stocks now turned negative.

The stock has tumbled nearly 20 per cent year-to-date. Shares of LIC, which were listed on the bourses on May 17 last year, are now trailing by about 40 per cent against its issue price of ₹949 a share. It had hit a high of ₹920 on the listing day.

Budget trigger slide

The initial selling came when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget 2023 proposed to tax income from life insurance policies (expect ULIP) having a premium or aggregate premium above ₹5 lakh in a year. This triggered a sharp fall in the price of insurance stocks.

After the meltdown in Adani stocks, the insurance major saw increased pressure at the bourses.

LIC had put out a statement on January 30, that it was still sitting on ₹26,000 crore of gains (notional) in their Adani Group investments even post the few days of rout following the release of the Hindenburg report. However, the destruction of Adani stocks turned its investments into the group negative, if one goes by the LIC statement.

Experts advised investors not to buy the stock on expectation of averaging cost. “It appears the recovery may not happen anytime soon. Even if the the stock attempts to bounce back, there will be a lot of selling pressure as some would to try to exit the stock,” a Chennai-based market analyst said.

Brokers’ view

However, brokerages and analysts expect a decent return from LIC stock, after its Q3 numbers earlier this month.

According to YES Securities, which came out with a Buy rating with a price target of ₹770 in its February 10 report: Management states that LIC’s market share in ULIP is small and there is more headroom for this product line to grow. However, its impact on margin will be offset by Non-Par Savings (Non-ULIP) and annuities, it said and added ”It may be noted that there have been six new product launches in 9M, all in the Non-ULIP Non-Par segment, barring one.”

Motilal Oswal Financial said (Feb 10 report) LIC has all the levers in place to maintain its industry-leading position and ramp up growth in the highly profitable product segments. “However, changing gears for such a vast organisation requires a superior and a well-thought out execution plan. We expect LIC to deliver a 15 per cent CAGR in APE over FY23-25,” it added.

Emkay Global Financial Services in its Q3 update has maintained its ‘Neutral’ rating on LIC saying “there is very little (relative to EV) value creation from the new business and the sustained market share loss in retail business continues.

In a recent annual Tamil Nadu Investors Association (TIA) meet, Deepak Shenoy of Capital Minds picked LIC as one of the stock ideas. According to him, earlier structure of profit sharing with policyholders and government was changed and that could result in transfer of ₹6,000 crore to shareholders in every quarter.","The insurance major’s stock closed at ₹567.75, down 2.9 per cent on the BSE, as its exposure to Adani stocks now turned negative.

A Bloomberg report has claimed that Sebi is examining both parties' (Hindenburg and Adani Group) accusations, but has not yet found any irregularities in the documents. Sebi, however, hasn’t issued any official statement on its investigation yet.

The report said that Sebi is closely inspecting the Adani Group's listed firms, their functioning, and trading of shares. But the market regulator has clarified that its actions should not be construed as a formal investigation.

On February 13, Sebi told the Supreme Court that it is “enquiring” into the allegations made by American short seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group of companies and its impact on the markets. Sebi said it was looking into the market activities of the whole group “preceding and post the publication of the report”, to detect if there were violations of its regulations.

The Hindenburg report, which went public on January 24, accused the Adani Group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud for decades”. It further said that the Indian conglomerate was involved in stock manipulation and fraud using shell companies. In its report, the short seller said that key listed Adani companies have taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their ""inflated stock"" for loans, putting the entire group ""on precarious financial footing"".

The report triggered a massive selloff of Adani Group stocks. The group’s market capitalisation has slipped below Rs 7 lakh crore by the end of Monday. The group’s market capitalisation eroded by another Rs 34,000 crore on Monday, taking the total market capitalisation erosion to 64 per cent or about Rs 12.37 lakh crore since the release of the Hindenburg Research report.

Flagship Adani Enterprises’ market capitalisation (mcap) stood at Rs 1.36 lakh crore, as of Monday, 65 per cent below the value of Rs 3.92 lakh crore on January 24. Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission have shed more than three-fourths of their value since January 24.

On Tuesday, many Adani Group stocks made a strong rebound after it was reported that the embattled group was planning to prepay or repay share-backed loans worth $690 million to $790 million by March end.

Despite the massive bloodbath in the market, S&P Global last week affirmed its rating on Adani Green Energy at 'BB+' with a stable outlook. The American credit rating agency has removed the company from under-criteria observation.

S&P said it expects the company's restricted group to help meet repayment obligations due to its strong reserving mechanism.

Adani Green's restricted group 2 includes three entities namely Wardha Solar (Maharashtra), Kodangal Solar Park, and Adani Renewable Energy (RJ).

On December 14 last year, the agency published its revised criteria for rating project finance transactions and placed Adani Green Energy Ltd under criteria observation. The agency on Friday said it has completed its review of AGEL RG2 and ""believes the revised criteria does not impact our assessment of the project's creditworthiness"".

Last week, even Fitch Ratings affirmed the 'BBB-' ratings on the $400-million senior secured notes issued by Adani Transmission Ltd. The outlook of the embattled Adani Group company is stable, the rating agency said.

Adani Transmission's RG1 includes six co-issuers - Barmer Power Transmission Service Limited, Chhattisgarh-WR Transmission, Hadoti Power Transmission Service, Raipur-Rajnandgaon-Warora Transmission, Sipat Transmission Limited, and Thar Power Transmission Service - and one non-issuing SPV, Adani Transmission (Rajasthan) Ltd (ATRL).

Fitch in its statement said that ATL RG1's credit assessment is not directly affected by the alleged malpractices at India's Adani group highlighted in Hindenburg Research's report due to the ringfenced nature of these assets. The offshore bondholders benefit from a robust cash flow waterfall mechanism and covenants that restrict cash upstreaming to shareholders and limit indebtedness. Moreover, ATL RG1 has a 30-year largely amortizing bond.

The domestic indices were dragged by energy, pharma, technology and metal stocks. Interest rate hike fears, sustained foreign selling and GDP data for the December quarter (Q3), due later in the day, kept investors cautious.

The 30-share BSE Sensex pack fell 326 points or 0.55 per cent to settle at 58,962; while the broader NSE Nifty index moved 89 points or 0.51 per cent down to close at 17,304.

In contrast, Asian stocks settled mostly higher.

Selling pressure in select index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries and Infosys also dragged the indices lower.

""Global investors' interest in the equity market is weakening due to the slowdown in the economy, led by high inflation and contractionary monetary policy. Inflows are being diverted to safe assets, and corporate earnings growth is dropping, affecting the performance of the stock market and demanding a downgrade in valuation. The double whammy for India is that it is expensive compared to other EMs, resulting in underperformance among the global market,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Foreign portfolio investors have so far offloaded Rs 32,518 crore worth of Indian equities in 2023.

Eight out of the 15 sectoral indices on NSE settled in the red. Nifty Oil & Gas, Nifty Pharma, Nifty IT and Nifty Metal underperformed the Nifty index by falling 1.34 per cent, 1.31 per cent, 0.85 per cent and 0.84 per cent, respectively.

Two Adani Group stocks -- Adani Total Gas Ltd and Adani Transmission Ltd -- tanked 5 per cent, each, to close at their respective one-year low levels.

Among non-Adani Group names, Vedanta dived by 6.58 per cent. Rail Vikas Nigam (RVNL) cracked 6.05 per cent. One97 Communications (Paytm's parent) and Indiabulls Real Estate fell up to 5.89 per cent. Index heavyweights Reliance and Infosys declined up to 1.99 per cent.

This followed a report published by US-based short seller Hindenburg. ICRA notes that while ATGL has staggered some of the capex plans over the next two years considering progress achieved in projects awarded in ninth and tenth rounds. Further, ATGL has funding tie-ups to meet the capex requirements in the near term, it has large capex requirements over the longer term which need significant debt funding. Hence, the Adani Group’s reduced financial flexibility can impact ATGL’s ability to raise funds from the domestic and international markets and result in higher cost of capital.

“ICRA will be monitoring the Adani Group’s ability to raise funds from the domestic/global market as equity/debt at competitive rates. Further, ICRA also sees an increased risk of regulatory/legal scrutiny on the Adani Group entities and its impact on the credit quality of ATGL will be monitored,” the rating agency said.

ICRA noted that any review of investment in ATGL by Total, in the backdrop of current developments leading to any weakening of linkage remains a sensitivity factor and the developments will be monitored.

ICRA noted that the Group’s strong financial flexibility and APSEZL’s track record of refinancing a large part of its debt with borrowings (mostly from overseas debt capital markets) of longer tenures at lower interest rates were the key credit strengths, which have been adversely impacted.

The latest study on the corporate governance levels in some of the top listed companies has found that while the rules for disclosures have been strengthened over the years, companies continue to provide bare minimum details in many aspects related to the audit firm.

“Disclosures around auditor independence, competence, and experience continue to remain poor. While regulations have pushed for disclosure, most companies continue to provide sparse details on the auditors’ background of how they were selected,” stated a report by proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services or IIAS.

The report titled ‘Corporate Governance Scores 2022’ took into account companies that are a part of the BSE-100 index.

To be sure, boards of as many as 23 per cent of the companies that were analysed provided information about the independence, competence, and experience of the statutory auditors, which was a significant jump from two per cent in 2020 and eight per cent in 2021.

This assumes significance also because of the fact that the recent tussle between Adani Group and Hindenburg Research brought to the fore the issue of audit firms after the US-based short seller highlighted the fact that the auditor of Adani Enterprises – the flagship company of the diversified conglomerate – was a little-known firm called Shah Dhandaria & Co, whose partners were in their 20s.

“The recent battle between a short-seller and one of India’s largest business groups has once again brought the debate over audit quality to light,” stated the IIAS report, adding that “it raised pertinent questions regarding the audit quality”.

“Considered a best practice, audit committees must periodically test for auditor independence and audit quality. More so because auditors are no longer reappointed annually – they have five-year terms in case of companies and three-years in case of banks and NBFCs,” said the report.

While the government has established an audit regulator as well – the National Financial Regulatory Authority or NFRA – the watchdog has been “mired in controversy and has become a political hot-button,” stated the report.

Moving forward, we expect the establishment of an audit regulator to make a material difference to the audit quality for corporate India, it added.

Karan Adani is the CEO of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, a port company of the Adani Group.

Speaking at Andhra Global Investors Summit 2023, Adani said that his group operates two large ports - Krishnapatnam and Gangavaram - in the state with a total capacity of 100 million metric tonnes per annum. ""In the next five years, we aim to add another million metric tonnes of capacity and also transform these ports into industrial port cities,"" he said.

By developing industrial clusters at Krishnapatnam and Gangavaram, Adani said, the group will be able to reduce the logistics costs drastically, thus making these industries far more competitive globally.""

Adani said his group, whose functioning has come under scanner following a damaging report by US-based short seller Hindenburg, is also developing 15,000 MW of renewable power projects over the next few years across five districts of Anantapur, Kadappa, Kurnool, Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram.

""Our other investments in the state include cement manufacturing units and data centres,"" he said, adding that presently the conglomerate does not have any cement manufacturing capacity in Andhra Pradesh.

""Hence, as part of our expansion plans, we will be setting up cement plants in Kadapa and Nadikudi with a total capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum,"" he said.

Last year, Adani Group bought Ambuja and ACC from Swiss cement major Holcim and became the second-largest cement player in India. After the acquisition, Karan Adani was appointed as a non-executive director of Ambuja Cement and as the non-executive chairman of ACC.

Also, Adani Group is working on developing a 400 MW of data centre in Visakhapatnam. ""These projects will bring further employment opportunities and demonstrate our commitment to the sustainable growth of the state of Andhra Pradesh,"" he said.

Gautam Adani-led Adani Group is currently facing the heat in markets following fraud charges by Hindenburg.

While there have been concerns about the group's expansion plan funded by debt, Adani maintains that the balance sheet of its companies is 'very healthy’ and business plans are 'fully funded'.

Mumbai: Adani Group on Thursday said US-based boutique investment firm GQG Partners has picked up equity stakes worth $1.87 billion (₹15,446 crore) in four listed group companies Adani Transmission and flagship Adani Enterprises - via secondary share sales.These transactions took place through a series of block deals and involved a single group entity, SB Adani Family Trust, as the seller.While the infrastructure conglomerate did not disclose the purpose of these transactions, sources in the know told ET that the funds will be used to repay chunks of promoter debt.That would also include a $500-million loan tranche taken as part of the $4.5-billion acquisition financing of ACC and Ambuja Cements last year. This loan is up for repayment in March.""We are delighted to complete this landmark transaction with GQG,"" said Jugeshinder (Robbie) Singh, chief financial officer of Adani Group, in a statement. ""We value GQG's role as a strategic investor in our infrastructure and utility portfolio of sustainable energy, logistics and energy transition.""Adani Group initially planned to refinance the $500-million loan due in March via overseas bond issuances, but later shelved those plans to explore alternatives.Sources said the conglomerate may also use the funds to prepay a $750-million mezzanine debt facility, which was also taken to help finance the purchase of the twin cement assets, billed as the biggest takeover in India's building materials industry to date.Exchange data showed GQG Partners bought 38.7 million shares, or 3.39% of the share capital of Adani Enterprises, valued at $660 million (Rs 5,460 crore). Shares were acquired at Rs 1,410.86 apiece, said the media statement. In Adani Ports, GQG Partners bought 88.6 million shares, or 4.1%, worth $ 640 million (Rs 5,282 crore).

Now at the centre of a scandal over stock market manipulation and fraud that, within a few weeks, contributed to an epic fall from the position of Asia’s richest person, Adani has literally taken Bangladesh for a fortune-ride through the controversial deal. Though officially still kept under tight wraps, the agreement has lately been published by a news portal and a number of whistleblowers in public interest.

“This appears to be the most expensive, lopsided contract to replenish the pockets of the ex-richest man in Asia, at the expense of the people in Bangladesh,” Tim Buckley, a Sydney-based energy expert with 30 years of expertise in the field, told The Daily Star over the phone recently.

Knowingly or unknowingly, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) rushed to sign a deal that only allows Adani Power to mint money at every single phase, from coal purchase to electricity export. The document, in essence, lays bare how Bangladesh is forced to stay in the agreement even if Adani breaches the contract, according to the experts who analysed a copy of the deal obtained by The Daily Star.

For the next 25 years, Bangladesh will partially bear what was initially thought to be Adani Power’s tax burden even though the Indian conglomerate got a tax exemption based on the export deal it struck with Bangladesh.

Also read: Numbers Suggest Bangladesh Didn’t Need the Adani Power Deal. So Why Was it Signed?

And once the plant comes into commercial operation next month, Bangladesh will start paying Adani reference tariffs based on taxes it does not even pay. In other words, the agreement has a unique design: Adani saves costs but charges Bangladesh the same amount, in turn raking more profits.

It is estimated that Adani Power will save over $1 billion on the Clean Energy Cess (a form of carbon tax) alone over the 25 years of the contract by virtue of becoming a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), according to an investigation by the Washington Post.

That’s just the reduction from one type of tax. Adani enjoys myriad other tax benefits and significant cost cuts for becoming an export-oriented plant through the deal with Bangladesh.

“So, the total savings for Adani will be way over $1 billion. For example, Adani also saves around $100 to $200 million on import duties of their equipment from China but it’ll charge Bangladesh for the import duties. Its profits will be hefty — to put it lightly,” Buckley said.

The Indian conglomerate, however, saw no evil. When contacted, a spokesperson from Adani on February 23 said, “The tax assumptions were uncertain when the deal was signed, and we took a risk fixing the costs. So, the SEZ tax exemption is our savings, in a lump sum contract – it is business.”

Requesting anonymity for fear of reprisal, the lawyer who reviewed the power purchase agreement for this paper begged to differ. “In a fair deal favouring both sides, Adani’s cut in costs from tax benefits would mean Bangladesh also gets shares of them or at least, a portion of them.”

However, in another interview on February 24, another spokesperson for Adani, said, “Since the Godda project is at a designated SEZ, power consumers of Bangladesh will not have to pay for the customs duty, taxes and cess, as applicable per current norms.”

Taxes and tariffs apart, Bangladesh is liable to pay roughly $450 million a year in capacity charges, even if it doesn’t buy electricity from Adani due to any reason, as stated in the original terms of the contract, Buckley said.

A strong voice for the protection of natural resources, Professor Anu Muhammad thinks that it is not a deal but a gift to Adani, who is seen as the closest ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“As far as unfair deals go, the Adani contract is record-breaking,” he told The Daily Star.

Adani’s possible breach of contract

When signing the deal in 2017, Adani Power included a bevy of tax assumptions into the reference tariffs that Bangladesh will have to pay. These include 12 percent excise duties, 15 percent service tax, VAT, and income tax payable in India among others.

In February 2019, Adani’s Godda Power Plant became a Special Economic Zone, following amendments to guidelines that previously did not allow a stand-alone power plant to receive such benefits.

Only on the grounds of exporting electricity to Bangladesh, Adani’s Godda Power Plant was declared an SEZ, according to the official documents of the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

To interpret it simply, had it not been for Bangladesh, Adani would not have received the exemption from the corporate taxes. Most of Adani’s expenditure in excise duties, state goods and services tax, have been nullified by the SEZ declaration, along with a 100 percent deduction in income tax for the first five years.

A clause in the agreement, 13.d (i) stipulates that Adani must officially inform the BPDB of the change in tax assumptions within 30 days. Another clause later in the document purports to allow the BPDB to recover the redundant tax charges, but that too has legal barriers.

Almost four years after the SEZ declaration, Adani has not officially (in writing) informed the BPDB of their exact savings, said a BPDB official, seeking anonymity for sharing what is seen as “sensitive information”.

As per the Contract Act 1872 of Bangladesh, Adani’s concealment of information constitutes a breach of contract and renders the agreement legally void.

A previous analysis by the AdaniWatch — a non-profit project of the Bob Brown Foundation that keeps an eye on the Adani Group’s misdeeds across the planet — showed the violation and questioned whether the agreement is legally void. In standard agreements, the innocent party, which is the BPDB in this case, would have two options: ask for compensation or terminate the agreement altogether.

But the contract is not legally void; an unusual clause in the agreement prevents the BPDB from rescinding it.

Section 4.2 (L) states that the BPDB may give a notice of default, in the case of, “any material breach…by the company of this agreement [Adani], having a material and adverse effect on the company’s ability to perform its obligations under the agreement, that is not remedied within sixty [60] days.”

This clause was not used in the power purchase agreements with Payra and Rampal, according to the documents.

Put another way, only when a breach of contract “adversely affects” Adani, the BPDB has legal grounds to leave. Hiding the amount of money it is saving from taxes does not hinder Adani’s ability to produce. As such, the BPDB has no grounds to opt out of the 25-year binding contract.

Adani did inform the BPDB of the change in taxes, the Adani spokesperson told this paper. The spokesperson was requested to provide proof with the written documentation sent to the BPDB.

Adani spokesperson declined, stating the document is “business confidential”. The spokesperson said, “Ask the BPDB for the list of notifications we sent during the last 5 years. If they have compiled correctly, it should be there.”

“When we place the invoice, it will be clear what the cost per unit is. In our calculation, it will be the lowest in Bangladesh,” claimed the Adani spokesperson.

Adani profits by not sharing tax benefits

At each turn of the deal, page after page, Gautam Adani rakes in profits — on the Carmichael coalmine (Adani’s Australian mine that produces high ash, low energy coal), coal port, railway line, the power plant in Godda, and part of the transmission line that he owns.

The agreement is “cost plus plus,” said Buckley. It has been designed in a manner that ensures Adani profits more and more, and Bangladesh doesn’t get a piece of that cake.

Each time Adani dangled a carrot in front of the BPDB, the very next instance, it took it away.

For example, a clause in the agreement purports to reduce the capacity price when the taxes change. Clause 13.(d) (iv) states, “Following the commercial operations date, a change in assumptions resulting in a one-time charge or expenditure (or a one-time increase or decrease in a charge or expenditure) shall cause an adjustment in the Reference Capacity Price.” Sounds fair?

The very facade of fairness Adani shows in clause (iv) is quickly counteracted by clause (v) that follows. It states, “The parties expressly agree that no adjustment shall be applied or paid due to a change in assumption resulting from any change in taxes… until the plant has been commissioned.” This provision further shows that the adjustment will not be done when it favours the BPDB, which is the perfect example of “discrimination,” said the lawyer who reviewed the agreement.

Hasan Mehedi, member secretary of the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BGWED), gives an idea about logical re-adjustment in pricing.

“Adani’s tax cuts should’ve decreased the capacity price by 12-15 percent. If we take the current exchange rate, we will pay billions of dollars in 25 years when our foreign currency reserves are depleting.”

Prof Anu Muhammad agrees: “There was clearly no negotiation here. Adani dictated these terms and Bangladesh went along with it for political gains.”

The lawyer said, “The misrepresentation aspect of the agreement is that Adani has created a clause that will not allow the BPDB to get any tax holiday or rebate, so they can basically overcharge the capacity price.”

Adani spokesperson said, “We have to factor in our savings in a business deal. We made the power plant in Jharkhand to reduce our total cost as the value of land price was lower.”

“The design of the agreement is such that if there are additional taxes imposed by the Indian government, those will not be imposed on Bangladesh. The Indian government is now taking steps to ensure that every coal-fired power plant will need to use biomass, which will hamper our efficiency but those costs won’t be borne by Bangladesh,” added the spokesperson.

Tim Buckley said avoiding corporate taxes has long been an avenue for Adani to reduce its costs of production and increase the profit margins. Adani has also set up multiple ways to minimise the amount of tax it pays in Australia, where it has its coal mine.

Filings in Singapore by privately-owned Adani companies show that one of them, Atulya Resources, is registered in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, according to an investigation by ABC’s Four Corners programme.

“There is also an ability for $2 per tonne royalty to be paid off to tax a haven from the Carmichael coalmine. So if Adani is buying 7 million tonnes [of coal], then there will be $14 million flying off to some tax haven … ,” said Buckley.

Why did Bangladesh sign the deal?

Once US investment research firm Hindenburg blasted Adani Group’s brazen stock manipulation and accounting schemes, the alarm bells started ringing in Bangladesh.

Experts in Bangladesh, who previously raised serious concerns regarding the deal, are now questioning why the nation, which has excess power generation capacity, got on board with Adani.

When Hasan Mehedi co-authored an article with India’s advocacy institution Growthwatch, Bangladeshi officials hit back saying “the report was done to ruin the relationship between Bangladesh and India”.

“But our point remains and it’s coming out now. This deal will be disastrous for Bangladesh,” Mehedi said.

“The same officials who signed previous agreements with foreign power plants, okayed Adani’s agreement, knowing fully well that it does not favour Bangladesh.”

A source in the BPDB, requesting anonymity, said, “We didn’t get too much time to go through this agreement which was examined by the Power Division itself.”

Contacted on many occasions, the Power Division declined to comment on the matter.

The BPDB chairman was contacted but he refused to comment.

Nasrul Hamid, the state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, responded to a phone call on February 25 but did not respond to specific questions.

As per his request, The Daily Star sent him further questions over WhatsApp but he was yet to respond to those when this report was published.

Is there a way out?

Regarding ways out, Section 19.4 of the power purchase agreement states that any dispute that is not resolved shall finally be settled in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, 2016, 6th Edition.

The BPDB could ideally take the agreement to arbitration in Singapore for termination, the lawyer told The Daily Star.

Anu Muhammad said, “The public will bear the cost of this expensive contract. We can argue against the deal for it being agreed upon without considering the public interest of Bangladesh.”

Adani enjoys myriad other tax benefits and significant cost cuts for becoming an export-oriented plant through the deal with Bangladesh.
“As far as unfair deals go, the Adani contract is record-breaking,” he told The Daily Star.

He said that LIC after the meeting is more confident of its business prospects with the port-to-power conglomerate, Kumar told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.

Last month, in an exclusive interview with Business Today TV Managing Editor, Siddharth Zarabi, Kumar said LIC is scheduled to meet the Adani Group management to get a better understanding of the whole issue.

The port-to-power conglomerate has been under fire since US-based short seller Hindenburg Research accused the Gautam Adani-led group of stock manipulation, running offshore shell companies for round-tripping, and misusing corporate governance practices.

Since the report was made public, LIC's exposure to Adani group firms' stock has come under scrutiny. The insurance major has invested in seven of 10 listed companies of the Adani Group. As of December 2022, LIC held 9.14 per cent in Adani Ports; 5.96 per cent in Adani Total Gas; 4.23 per cent in Adani Enterprises; 3.65 per cent in Adani Transmission; and 1.28 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

The issue has also rocked the parliament after the Opposition parties claimed that LIC and SBI’s “overexposure in Adani group stocks” is a major scam. On February 24, the value of shares LIC held in the Adani Group dropped to Rs 29,893.13 crore against a purchase price of Rs 30,127 crore.

The group, after the report was out, said the total purchase value of equity, purchased over the last many years, under all the Adani Group companies was over Rs 36,000 crore and the market value as on January 27 was Rs 56,142 crore.

But following this, the insurance major lost a huge amount following the massive selloff in Adani stocks.

In mid-February, the state-run insurance company lost nearly Rs 50,000 crore on its investments in the Adani group stocks. The combined market value of its investments in seven Adani stocks - Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission, Ambuja Cements and ACC - plunged to Rs 33,242 crore as on February 23 from Rs 82,970 crore as on December 31, 2022.

On February 27, shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India hit their 52-week low level of Rs 566 against a previous close of Rs 584.65. The weakness in Adani stocks and deep erosion in market capitalisation (m-cap) got reflected on the LIC counter as well.

The state-run insurance giant recovered its losses on its investment in the Adani Group stocks after shares of the conglomerate rose for the third consecutive session last week.

In the last one month, shares of Adani Ports have risen 25.36 per cent. On Friday, the shares of Adani Ports rose nearly 10 per cent to settle at Rs 684.35 while Adani Green Energy jumped 5 per cent to close at Rs 562.

However, a rally in the Adani stocks following massive investment from a global investment firm has recovered LIC's notional losses. The ten listed Adani Group firms saw their combined market capitalisation climb a whopping Rs 1.73 lakh crore in the past four trading sessions till March 3.

The value of LIC's investment in the embattled group has risen by about Rs 9,000 crore and now stands at Rs 39,068.34 crore, as of March 3.

His group, which includes 10 listed companies, saw its market capitalisation (m-cap) recovering to Rs 9 lakh crore level, still way away from Rs 19.20 lakh crore level as on January 24, the day Hindenburg came out with its scathing report on alleged stock manipulation and accounting fraud at the group companies.

Adani, 60, was last valued at $52.1 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaire index. His personal wealth hit a low of $37.70 billion on February 27 amid relentless selloff in his group shares such as Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission Ltd, Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd. That said, the billionaire still has lost 57 per cent or $68.5 billion notionally in 2023 so far. Adani was the second richest on this planet in September 2022.

On Wednesday, at least four of Adani group stocks hit their upper circuit limits. Adani Power hit its 5 per cent upper circuit limit at Rs 186.75. Adani Transmission hit its upper circuit at Rs 819.90. Adani Green Energy was locked at its upper circuit limit of Rs 619.60. Adani Total Gas also hit its upper circuit limit at Rs 861.90.

The Adani shares have recovered recently after the group said it has repaid share-based financing of Rs 7,374 crore and would prepay all such remaining loans by the end of the month. Besides, SB Adani Family Trust last week sold Rs 15,446 crore worth stakes in four Adani group firms to US-based GQG Partners. Besides, the conglomerate has lined up more road shows to shore up investor confidence after Hindenburg Research's scathing report on January 24, which sent the group market capitalisation falling as much as $150 billion recently. The moves are seen boosting investor confidence, as seen in the recent recovery in Adani group shares.

With this repayment to various international banks and Indian financial institutions, shares of four listed Adani companies will be released, the Gautam Adani-led group said in a statement. The prepayment is seen as yet another move to soothe concerns among investors and lenders.

The four Adani companies with the number of shares and promoter shareholding released are Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (155 million shares or 11.8%), Adani Enterprises Ltd (31 million shares or 4%), Adani Transmission Ltd (36 million shares or 4.5%), and Adani Green Energy Ltd (11 million shares or 1.2%).

Over the past month, the Adani family has paid off ₹11,000 crore of debts to lower the group’s leverage.

Along with last month’s repayments, Adani has now repaid $2.02 billion of share-backed financing, in line with promoters’ commitment to prepay all share-backed financing before 31 March 2023, the statement said.

Some Adani group stocks may continue their recovery when markets open on Wednesday after the Holi holiday on prepayment of promoter debt. The prepayment of ₹7,374 crore, coupled with the removal of Adani Enterprises from short-term additional surveillance measures (ASM) effective 8 March, could provide a sentimental boost.

On Thursday, the SB Adani Family Trust, an Adani promoter group entity, sold between 2.5% and 4.1% of its holdings in Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Transmission for ₹15,446 crore through a series of bulk deals. Tuesday’s statement, however, did not mention whether this money was used for the latest prepayment.

However, analysts caution that the rally might not be as sharp as seen recently in Adani Enterprises, as the stock has jumped a sharp 66% from a low of ₹1,193 over five sessions to ₹1,982 on 6 March.

“Removal of the stock from ASM is sentimentally another positive, but the price could move either way with the margin reducing drastically after exit from additional surveillance measures,"" said Kruti Shah, an analyst at Equirus Securities.

“Prepayment and removal from ASM could add more legs to the rally under way since the past week, especially in group stocks subject to the 5% price band,"" said Hormuz Maloo, director of AFco Investments. “However, price volatility could surface depending on news flows.""

Adani Group shares plunged after US short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report alleging accounting fraud and price manipulation against the conglomerate on 24 January. This forced Adani Enterprises to withdraw its ₹20,000 crore follow-on public offering, and its stock has plunged 70% since the report became public. However, since the end of February, prices began to recover and, from 2 March, gathered pace after GQG Partners picked up a stake worth $1.87 billion from the Adani Family Trust in Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission. It is these companies whose share-backed debt has been prepaid now.

Late last week, however, Adani Ports and Adani Total Gas suffered a setback as ratings agency Icra Ltd downgraded their outlook to negative from stable, though their ratings remain unchanged. On the other hand, for Adani Total Gas, Icra enhanced its rating amount to ₹5,500 crore from ₹2,801 crore.","Mumbai: The Adani group on Tuesday said it has prepaid share-backed loans totalling ₹7,374 crore ahead of their maturity in April 2025, as the conglomerate aims to reduce promoter leverage.

However, the start of March month has seen hefty buying from FPIs. Between March 1st to March 3, FPIs have pumped in over ₹8,300 crore in equities. The strong buying in the initial days of the current month can be due to large inflows from foreign investors in four Adani firms. Going forward, bond yields are likely to play a spoilsport for foreign funds inflow in domestic equities.

As per NSDL data, FPIs pulled out ₹5,294 crore from equities during the overall February month. While they were net buyers in the debt market with an inflow of ₹2,436 crore this month.

In January month, the outflow stood at ₹28,852 crore from equities.

Meanwhile, in the first three trading sessions of March (1st to 3rd), FPIs have infused a whopping ₹8,939 crore in Indian equities, while their buying in debt instruments have been merely ₹380 crore.

Last week, mega-buying from foreign investors in Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports, and Adani Transmission lifted overall market sentiments. US-based GQG Partners purchased equity shares in these Adani companies for a massive ₹15,446 crore in a series of secondary block deals.

Overall, in the week from February 27 to March 3rd, Indian equities clocked an inflow of ₹6,010.44 crore from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). FIIs sold ₹2,022.52 crore on February 27, while the outflow was at ₹4,559.21 crore on February 28 and ₹424.88 crore on March 1st. However, they made a massive buying of ₹12,770.81 crore on March 2nd followed by another inflow of ₹246.24 crore on March 3rd.

In February month, FIIs sold ₹11,090.64 crore compared to the previous month's outflow of a massive ₹41,464.73 crore, as per Stock Edge data.

Dr.V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said, ""FPIs continued selling in early March too. However, the data ( NSDL) shows a net FPI figure of ₹8902 crores up to 4th March. This discrepancy is due to the US-based investment firm GQG making a massive investment of ₹15446 crores in four Adani stocks.""

However, Vijaykumar also said, ""excluding this, FPIs continued to be sellers to the tune of ₹6544 crores in March till 4th. Excluding the GQG investment, FPIs have sold equity to the tune of ₹41169 crores in 2023.""

Due to strong buying in the last trading session of last week, Sensex's overall weekly performance was up by 1.3% and the Nifty 50 surged by 0.9%. On Friday, after rising by nearly 2% each, Sensex closed at 59,808.97 up by 899.62 points or 1.53% and Nifty 50 ended at 17,594.35 higher by 272.45 points or 1.57%.

Going ahead, Vijayakumar said, ""FIIs are likely to sell at higher levels since the US 10-year bond yield is at 4% and this is an attractive risk-free investment for FPIs. FPIs have been buyers in financials, capital goods, and autos and sellers in Oil & Gas and metals.""

Year-to-date, FPIs are net sellers with an outflow of ₹21,256 crore. This comes after including, an outflow of ₹25,207 crore in Indian equities, ₹1,964 crore in debt-VRR, and ₹431 crore in the hybrid market --- and also adding an inflow of ₹6,347 crore in the debt market.

Condemning the Centre’s alleged pressure on the managements of LIC and State Bank of India to invest a huge sum of money in Adani group of companies, the Congress staged a demonstration here on Wednesday.

The Congress cadre raised slogans against the investment of public money in the Adani group of companies even as the shares of these firms were falling after Hindenberg revelations on alleged irregularities by Mr. Adani.

“The Union Finance Ministry, due to pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office, is forcing the LIC and SBI managements to invest massively in Adani group of companies even as the prices of these shares are falling sharply. Consequently, LIC and SBI have suffered huge losses. The public money being invested in these shares is nothing but looting their hard-earned money,” said Tirunelveli city district Congress president K. Sankarapandian, who led the agitation.

The protestors also raised slogans against loss of lakhs of jobs, inflation and fuel price rise.

PSU bank stocks in for a treat,"The same Adani stocks which led to one of the biggest losses in investors' wealth in February, became the positive factor to drive markets in the initial days of March. All Adani stocks saw the best week with double-digit gains last week for the first time after the Hindenburg report in late January. The reason behind such stellar buying is attributed to foreign funds inflow through a series of block deals in four Adani companies. The mega block deal comes as a sign of comfort among investors in embattled Adani. Does that mean, the latest rally in Adani shares has brought the bulls back to market?

Adani stocks have been under pressure since January 24th after a Hindenburg report accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation, fraud, and tax evasion. While investigations are ongoing in Adani over these allegations, however, the mega block deal seems to have calmed the tide over Adani shares for now.

Last week, GQG Partners which is one of the leading US-based global equity investment boutiques, purchased equity shares of four Adani companies for a whopping ₹15,446 crore in a series of secondary block deals. Other foreign investors have also pumped funds into Adani shares. These four companies are Adani Enterprises, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Ports.

On Friday last week, on BSE, Adani Enterprises stock rose nearly 17%, and Adani Ports was up nearly 10%. While stocks like Adani Transmission, Adani Power, Adani Wilmar, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas hit 5% upper circuit. The NDTV share price soared nearly 5% as well. Meanwhile, ACC was up over 5% and Ambuja Cements surged nearly 6%.

Following the strong rally in Adani stocks, overall markets also saw the best single-day performance for the current year. On Friday, Sensex closed at 59,808.97 up by 899.62 points or 1.53%. While Nifty 50 ended at 17,594.35 higher by 272.45 points or 1.57%. During the trading session, both benchmarks clocked nearly 2% upside each.

Overall, Sensex has climbed 1.3% and the Nifty 50 soared nearly 0.9% between February 27 to March 3rd. Bank Nifty also jumped by 2.3% or 944.25 points. PSU banks saw the most buying after the block deals in Adani firms. Nifty PSU Bank rises over 326 points or nearly 8.95% in the week.

Between February 27 to March 3rd, Adani Enterprises stock gained nearly 44%, Adani Ports jumped over 20%, Adani Green Energy soared over 21.5%, Adani Total Gas jumped over 9%, Adani Power climbed nearly 18%, Adani Wilmar zoomed nearly 17% and Adani Transmission advanced nearly 10%. In cement business, Ambuja Cements stock jumped over 14%, and ACC up nearly 10%. In media business, NDTV rallied by at least 18.5% on BSE.

After markets made robust gains last week on Friday, Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer, Axis Securities said, ""After the near USD 2bn investment by GQG partners in Adani Group, the stock market has heaved a sigh of relief, creating a kind of floor for Adani group stocks since a Marquee investor has invested in them at these prices.""

Kulkarni believes that ""promoters can use the money raised through the transaction to infuse capital in any group company requiring the funds through warrants, rights issues, or any other instrument.""

According to him, this development will also lead to better sentiments for the market and increase retail participation, which was down due to uncertainty.

He further said, ""The investment also leads to a belief that the Adani group stocks have stabilized and can raise capital if they want at current prices.""

He believes this development in Adani firms should support the banks, especially PSU Banks, which were hammered earlier, despite good performance due to fear of their exposure to the Adani group.

Some of the banks that declared their exposure in Adani companies after the Hindenburg report, the majority of them were from PSU banks. These banks were also under pressure post the short seller's allegations against the Adani Group.

In February, SBI stated that they have exposure of ₹27,000 crore in Adani Group which is less than 1% of their total lending book. While Bank of Baroda had revealed that their exposure does not fall under the top 10 of the exposures in Adani, and also stated that around 30% of the bank's exposure is backed by joint ventures with PSU Companies. Further, PNB had mentioned that it has approximately ₹7,000 crore exposure in Adani, of which ₹6,300 crore was funded exposure. Also, PNB has around ₹2,500 crore exposure in the group's airports business.

While Axis Bank had said that its exposure stood at 0.94% of its net advances in Adani Group. Further, the bank revealed that the fund-based exposure was 0.29% and non-fund-based outstanding loan exposure was 0.58%.

Also, IndusInd Bank's exposure in Adani came to around 0.49% of its total book. Further, the largest life insurer in India, LIC also has some exposure to Adani but it is less than 1% of its total book. LIC said, it has ₹35,917 crore under equity and debt at the end of December 2022.

Even DBS Group Holdings revealed they have somewhat $1.3 billion ($976 million) exposure to Adani firms --- of which --- $1 billion is from a cement business acquisition while $300 million is in other Adani firms. It revealed they are not concerned about this exposure in Gautam Adani's firm.

Major rating agencies such as Fitch and Moody's have said earlier in February that Indian banks' exposure in crises-laden Adani is not sufficient to give a substantial risk to these lenders' credit profiles. RBI deputy governor Mahesh Kumar Jain also said in a press conference during the month that domestic banks' exposure in Adani is not very significant.

Has the mega block deal in Adani firms brought bulls back to market?

Kulkarni said, ""We expect the markets to have a short-term bounce back due to increased optimism, but are still concerned about global interest rates and higher valuations, which can lead to increased medium-term volatility.""

He added, ""We advise investors to maintain investment discipline and keep investing regularly in equities for long-term wealth creation, especially if the markets are volatile in the short to medium term.""

Last week, Nirav Karkera, Head of Research, Fisdom told Mint that the recent spurt in Adani stocks needs to sustain for longer before one can distinctly recognize it as either entering a new range, the beginning of a fresh rally, or at least not simply a dead-cat bounce.

Karkera added, ""the stocks still remain highly sensitive to reported developments. Some spurt has been visible on a couple of counters owing to block purchases, but this may not really be an indicator of anything more than the buying entity’s conviction in the company’s growth prospects at the moment.""

GQG Partners who made one of the biggest buying through block deals said, it believes in Adani's long-term growth prospects.

One of the major reasons behind investment in Adani firms, as per Rajiv Jain, Chairman and CIO of GQG Partners, would be that these companies ""own and operate some of the largest and most important infrastructure assets throughout India and around the world.""

Rajiv said, ""We believe that the long-term growth prospects for these companies are substantial, and we are pleased to be investing in companies that will help advance India’s economy and energy infrastructure, including their energy transition over the long run.""

The reason behind lowering the outlook is due to risks in the financial flexibility of the Group after the Hindenburg report which led to a relentless selloff in these stocks in February. However, the rating actions could not tame the bulls in the majority of Adani stocks. In the week that ended March 10th, except for Adani Enterprises and the cement business, the rest of the Adani-led stocks surged in the week.

On Friday, Adani stocks saw a mixed sentiment. The flagship firm Adani Enterprises stock dropped by nearly 3%, while Adani Wilmar tumbled by at least 4.5%. Adani Ports closed on a flat note. Also, in cement stocks, Ambuja Cements dipped by 2%, and ACC shed nearly a percent. Media stock NDTV was also down by nearly 5%.

On the positive side were Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Green Energy as they touched 5% upper circuit. Adani Power also gained by nearly 5% on BSE.

But by end of March 10th, Adani Group's total market value stood around nearly ₹9.3 lakh crore. This is higher compared to the start of the week.

On March 6th, the group's market value together was near ₹8.85 lakh crore. During the end of February month, the market cap was around ₹6.82 lakh crore.

From March 6th to 10th, Adani Enterprises' stock plunged by nearly 4.4% on BSE. While Ambuja and ACC stocks dipped by nearly 2% and 1% respectively.

Rest all have recorded an upside!

In the week, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Adani Green Energy posted a nearly 16% surge each in their stock prices on BSE. Their market cap also regained over ₹1 lakh crore mark.

Also, Adani Power climbed by over 15% during the week. While Adani Ports and NDTV stock jumped over a percent. Lastly, Adani Wilmar climbed over 3%.

As of March 10, 2023, Adani Enterprises' m-cap is around ₹2,16,195.51 crore, while Adani Ports' m-cap stood at ₹1,50,745.3 crore. These two are the most valued firms of the Adani Group in terms of market share.

Further, Adani Transmission's m-cap is currently at ₹1,00,823.81 crore, Adani Total Gas at ₹1,04,498.46 crore, and Adani Green Energy at ₹1,08,197.34 crore. Also, Adani Power's m-cap is at ₹79,163.67 crore, Adani Wilmar's at ₹58,914.43 crore, Ambuja at ₹75,126.89 crore, ACC at ₹34,687.12 crore, and NDTV at ₹1,507.02 crore.

Moody's-backed ICRA was among the first to trim its outlook to Negative on two Adani companies on March 3rd. These were Adani Ports and Adani Total Gas. Earlier, their outlook was stable. However, ICRA reaffirmed its rating.

According to ICRA, the reason behind the lowering in the outlook of these two Adani companies was due to a deterioration in the group's financial flexibility.

Adani Group's financial flexibility has deteriorated after Hindenburg's report on January 24. The short seller's critical report led to steep declines in share prices and an increase in the yield of international bonds raised by the group's entities.

While last week, India Ratings also assigned a Negative outlook on Adani Green Energy and Adani Enterprises from their previous 'Stable'. Also, CARE Edge trimmed its outlook to Negative on Adani Enterprises.

In regards to Adani Enterprises, Ind-Ra's negative outlook on the company is due to the uncertainty on the cash flow mismatches resulting from the revised capex plans and the possible sources of funding available which may keep the equity cover lower than 2x.

While CARE Edge's rating action on Adani's flagship company was due to the expected moderation in the financial flexibility of the Adani group in case of any adverse outcome or observations from the ongoing regulatory and legal scrutiny directed by the Honourable Supreme Court of India in connection with various allegations against the Adani group of companies.

After the apex court's direction, market regulator Sebi is expected to complete the examination pertaining to the lapses in reporting mechanisms, disclosure adequacies, and manipulation of stock prices amidst other aspects of investigation in a time-bound manner.

However, both Ind-Ra and CARE believe that the latest fundraising of ₹15,446 crore from GQG Partners alleviates the risk to some extent in these companies and could aid in liquidity to a certain degree.

Meanwhile, the cement stocks were under pressure after a report stated that Gautam Adani, the chairperson of the Adani Group, is planning to sell a stake in the cement business for $450 million with the aim to reduce debt. Adani is looking to sell a 4-5% stake in Ambuja Cement to international lenders, reported Financial Times quoting sources.

The proposal is under consideration, D V Chanaka, Sri Lanka’s State Minister for Power and Energy, told businessline on Friday.

It is also learnt that the Adani group would bring into the island country its own 5.2 MW turbines, a prototype of which has been working for a year at Mundra, Gujarat.

Power production

The Adani group has developed the machine with technology from W2E (Wind to Energy) GmbH of Germany. The blades describe a circle of 165 meters diameter and the nacelle can sit on towers as tall as 140 meters. It can work at wind speeds of 3 meters per minute (very low) to 20 mps, reaching its optimum power production at 12 mps wind speeds.

Sri Lanka has huge wind power potential, with wind speeds of 75 mps at its good sites. According to an estimate of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the USA made many years ago, Sri Lanka has offshore wind potential to put up 45 GW. If an estimate is made now, on the basis of more modern machines, the number would be much higher, say industry experts, who also pointed out that the country has immense offshore wind potential, too. Sri Lanka itself would need very little of it—perhaps 10 GW in 2030, the experts said.

Sri Lanka can make money by selling the surplus to India — just as Bhutan does with hydro power.

Chanaka said an agreement for building a power transmission line project, which could possibly run from Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka to Madurai.

The Indian wind industry is quite gung-ho about putting up projects in Sri Lanka.","The Adani group, which has been given permission to put up 340 MW of onshore wind power projects in Sri Lanka, has asked the Sri Lankan government for enhancement of the approved capacity to 500 MW.

Paritosh Kashyap, president and head for wholesale banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank, told PTI that the issues surrounding Adani Group are more of a ""capital market and valuations issue and not a credit issue"".

""We have a small exposure to the group. We do business with every corporate in the country, and our exposures are in line with our credit philosophy and the size of our balance sheet,"" Kashyap said.

He added that operating companies in the group have ""reasonable leverage"", coupled with strong profitability and balance sheets.

The embattled conglomerate has been under surveillance by different government bodies after US short seller Hindenburg Research in a scathing report noted that the conglomerate is misusing tax havens and accused it of financial misdeeds, accounting fraud and stock manipulation. It also said that the stocks are overvalued by 85 per cent.

Also read: Adani-Hindenburg saga: Fund managers say governance, transparency issues still loom large over Adani

The report, which was published on January 24, led to a massive rout in Adani Group's listed companies’ stocks, which made investors nervous.

Kashyap of Kotak Mahindra Bank said the overall wholesale banking book is bereft of any stress for Kotak Mahindra Bank and also expressed concerns about the lack of any stress emerging for over seven years now.

""As a segment, I can't say anyone which has a stress,"" he said, adding that the bank is open to doing business with segments like infrastructure, real estate and lending to non-banks, which is otherwise considered as prone to stress.

The Adani Group, which has companies in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and ports, has been the subject of scrutiny by investors following the rout. This is mainly due to concerns over the Group's high leverage and its impact on the banking sector, and government-owned financial institutions like the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India. A CLSA recent report has highlighted that 39-40 per cent of the company's debt, which is close to Rs 2 lakh cr, is from the Indian banking sector from PSUs to private banks.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has launched a special examination of the banking system's exposures to Adani Group entities, and Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that a single case cannot impact the broader banking system.

According to experts, the Indian banks' exposures are to operative companies and not against shares at the listed holding company level. This is so because in most cases barring asset buys by infrastructure companies, Indian banks are not allowed to lend more than Rs 20 lakh as loans against shares, which has come in as a helpful regulatory mandate.

Earlier, the country’s biggest lender State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda, and Life Insurance Corporation had clarified their exposures and assured investors that the debts are well in order.

Last month, SBI said its overall exposure to Adani Group is about 0.9 per cent of its total loan book, which was about Rs 27,000 crore, and it has not extended any loan against shares to the group.

Insurance behemoth LIC also came out with its stand. It said its overall exposure is over Rs 35,000 crore, with a large part of it being in equity investments which have suffered alongside the rout in stocks, and some reports pegging the valuations dipping below the purchase price as well.

The insurance major has invested in seven of 10 listed companies of the Adani Group. As of December 2022, LIC held 9.14 per cent in Adani Ports; 5.96 per cent in Adani Total Gas; 4.23 per cent in Adani Enterprises; 3.65 per cent in Adani Transmission; and 1.28 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

Since the report was made public, LIC's exposure to Adani group firms' stock has come under scrutiny. The group, after the report was out, said the total purchase value of equity, purchased over the last many years, under all the Adani Group companies was over Rs 36,000 crore and the market value as on January 27 was Rs 56,142 crore.

In mid-February, the state-run insurance company lost nearly Rs 50,000 crore on its investments in the Adani Group stocks. The combined market value of its investments in seven Adani stocks - Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission, Ambuja Cements and ACC - plunged to Rs 33,242 crore as on February 23 from Rs 82,970 crore as on December 31, 2022.

Bank of Baroda had said the public lender has ""absolutely no concern"" about its exposure to tumult-hit Adani Group. After announcing December quarter results, the banks said its exposure to Adani Group is one fourth of the large exposure framework of RBI. It said that 30 per cent of total exposure to Adani Group is a joint venture with public sector companies.

Debt repayment

As per reports, Gautam Adani and his family have prepaid all borrowings backed by his conglomerate Adani Group's shares. A Bloomberg report said company executives told investors at a meeting in London that all borrowings have been prepaid.

The investor meeting was part of a worldwide roadshow launched by the conglomerate aimed at reassuring investors that the conglomerate's finances are under control, the report said. Another Bloomberg report said the Adani group has repaid a $500 million bridge loan that was due Thursday.

As part of the ongoing Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun (HAHK) series, the Congress on Thursday claimed that the Narendra Modi government wants to “hand over” the foodgrain logistics of the country to the Adani Group.

In his 25th statement under the HAHK series, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh claimed that such a “conspiracy” was only temporarily foiled by the farmers’ agitation that forced the withdrawal of three farm laws.

“A lap of honour around the stadium he got named after himself in his own lifetime is a good occasion for heralding a quarter century of pointed questions with Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun, ”Mr. Ramesh tweeted, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese taking a lap of the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad just ahead of the fourth Test between India and Australia.

“The publication ‘AdaniWatch’ has reported that on October 13, 2022, the Supreme Court of India quashed a June 30, 2021 Gujarat High Court judgment that favoured Adani Ports and SEZ over the government-owned Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), and said that the High Court judgment ‘is not sustainable in law’. The corporation was set up in 1957 to support India’s food storage needs and stored 55 lakh tonnes of food grains in 2021-22,” Mr. Ramesh said.

Explained | Adani Group stocks: What is Hindenburg Research, and how does a short seller operate?

“The Supreme Court observed that the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had supported the CWC’s stand while the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had aided Adani’s bid to take control of two major CWC warehouses near Mundra port by not supporting the denotification of the warehouses as part of the Adani SEZ,” he claimed, adding, “The judgment stated that ‘it does not augur well for the Union of India to speak in two contradictory voices’ and that ‘two departments of the Union of India cannot be permitted to take stands which are diagonally opposite’”.

The Congress leader asked why did the Commerce Ministry, then headed by Nirmala Sitharaman, take a stand opposed to a strategic public-sector corporation and in support of the Prime Minister’s “favourite business group”.

“Would she have the courage to do so without clear directions from above?” he asked.

Mr. Ramesh claimed that “this Adani-inspired inter-ministerial conflict” was allowed to continue even after Piyush Goyal became Minister of Commerce and Industry (in May 2019) as well as Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution (in October 2020).

‘For close cronies’

“The entire country knows that the motivation behind the ill-conceived farm laws was to hand over India’s agricultural logistics to a few of your [Prime Minister] close cronies,” Mr. Ramesh alleged.

“One of the biggest beneficiaries of the farm laws would have been Adani Agri Logistics which has become the major beneficiary of the Food Corporation of India’s silo contracts, the most recent award being one to set up 3.5 lakh metric tonnes of storage in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,” he added.

Meanwhile, Adani Farm-Pik was allowed to build a near-monopoly on apple procurement in Himachal Pradesh, he alleged.

The Congress leader questioned if India’s public sector, that has been painstakingly built over the past 70 years, is now being reduced to a vehicle for the enrichment of the “Prime Minister’s corporate friends”.","Ramesh tweeted, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese taking a lap of the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad just ahead of the fourth Test between India and Australia.

The Congress, quoting the recent interview of Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry with The Hindu, asked the Narendra Modi government on March 10 to explain the basis on which it identified the Adani Group for a “government-to-government” port project in Sri Lanka.

As part of its ongoing Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun (HAHK), Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed three fresh questions to Prime Minister Modi and accused his government of “lobbying” in favour of the Adani Group for projects in Sri Lanka.

“Parliament resumes on March 13. We are preparing for our interventions to be expunged. But what cannot be erased out is ‘ Hum Adanike Hain Kaun’-26 bringing the total of direct questions of the PM so far to 78,” Mr. Ramesh tweeted.

13 मार्च को संसद फिर शुरू होगी।हम जनहित के सवाल पूछना जारी रखेंगे।हो सकता है उन्हें भी रिकॉर्ड से हटा दिया जाए,लेकिन जिन्हें हटाया या मिटाया नहीं जा सकता,वो हैं ""HAHK-हम अडानी के हैं कौन"" श्रृंखला के तहत PM से पूछे गए सवाल,जिनकी संख्या 78 हो गई है।

In a statement, Mr. Ramesh said the governments of India, Japan and Sri Lanka (then headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe) had signed a memorandum on May 28, 2019 to develop the East Container Terminal in the Colombo South port. A year later, on June 9, 2020, the Sri Lankan cabinet headed by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa announced that India had “selected” Adani Ports as its foreign terminal operator, he added.

However, following the unexpected cancellation of the deal, the Rajapaksa government offered Colombo’s West Container Terminal to India and Japan under a 35-year build, operate and transfer lease, which was finalised on September 30, 2021.

“A Sri Lankan Cabinet spokesperson said that India had ‘nominated’ Adani Ports as the partner. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry described it as a ‘government-to-government’ port project in a March 5, 2023 interview,” Mr. Ramesh said, quoting The Hindu interview.

“On what basis did you ‘select’ and ‘nominate’ Adani Ports for this government-to-government deal? Did any other Indian firms have the opportunity to consider investing or did you simply reserve the deal for your close friends?” asked the Congress communication chief in an open letter to the Prime Minister.

Stating that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government’s 2002 decision not to invest in the strategic Hambantota Port cleared the path for Chinese firms to enter Sri Lanka’s ports sector, the Congress leader said India’s investment in Colombo now is partly driven by the need to counter China’s expansion.

“However, as we pointed out on March 3, 2023, the Adani Group has disturbing connections with Chinese nationals such as the Adani family confidant Chang Chung-Ling (aka Lingo-Chang) who has been involved, among other things, in violating UN sanctions against China’s and Pakistan’s ally North Korea,” he said, asking if these connections were not worthy of a probe by the Central investigative agencies.

Mr. Ramesh charged the Prime Minister of indulging in “hectic lobbying for his cronies”, including for a 500-megawatt wind power project in Sri Lanka’s Mannar district.

“The former head of the Ceylon Electricity Board, MMC Ferdinando, testified on June 10, 2022 before the Parliament of Sri Lanka that on October 24, 2021, ‘the President [Gotabaya Rajapaksa] summoned me after a meeting and said that India’s Prime Minister Modi is pressuring him to hand over the project to the Adani Group’. Although he retracted the comments under pressure, Ferdinando’s remarks had completely exposed the nexus of crony capitalism in which you are enmeshed,” the Congress leader alleged.","As part of its ongoing Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun (HAHK), Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed three fresh questions to Prime Minister Modi and accused his government of “lobbying” in favour of the Adani Group for projects in Sri Lanka.

“This is one of the best energy transition stories you can buy, one of the best infrastructure assets you can get in India,” GQG Partners chairman Jain said on a call with reporters in Australia Wednesday. “Our view is we need to buy companies that are part of the solution.”

The star investor's confidence should bolster overall investor confidence in the ports-to-power conglomerate, which has been battling a US short seller's damning report against it.

“We feel these are unique assets,” Jain said, adding that over time GQG may raise its stake in Adani Group companies. “This is truly a long term investment and chances are we will probably buy more because we are not at full size at this point.”

Jain, based in Florida, has been meeting with investors, including pension funds, in Melbourne and will hold similar meetings later in Sydney.

Adani has major coal assets, which could affect the environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets of superannuation and other Australian investors.

Jain said he agrees on the long-term energy transition but fossil fuel cannot be shut off now.

""It's a more convenient issue rather than a substantive issue. A lot of people simply do box checking exercise. We feel that you need to make the transition, but the transition has to be based on some realistic aspects,"" he said.

New York-based short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the Adani group in a Jan. 24 report of stock manipulation and improper use of offshore tax havens that it said obscured the extent of Adani family stock ownership in group firms. The group has denied the charges.

The allegations resulted in seven of the Indian group's listed firms losing about $130 billion in market value, and the group also shelved a Rs 20,000-crore share sale.

Domestic stock markets rose over the past three trading sessions after a board-based recovery in 10 listed Adani Group stocks. However, investors have again shifted focus to the possibility of prolonged higher interest rates globally, including the US.

In response to Hindenburg questioning the role of Vinod Adani, 74, in the Adani group where it alleged ""brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud"" and use of offshore shell companies to inflate stock prices, the apples-to-airport conglomerate had in January said that ""Vinod Adani does not hold any managerial position in Adani listed entities or their subsidiaries and has no role in their day to day affairs.""

""We reiterate that any transactions by the Adani portfolio companies with any related party have been duly identified and disclosed as related party transactions in compliance with Indian laws and standard and have been carried out on arm's length terms,"" it had said.

Hindenburg Research had alleged that Vinod Adani was responsible for creating and managing a vast network of offshore shell entities meant for stock parking, market manipulation and laundering money, to help the conglomerate's companies maintain their appearance of financial health.

The group has denied all Hindenburg allegations, calling them ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"".

The Congress on March 14 not only persisted with their demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the charges against the Adani group but stepped up its attack by circulating a social media video of Rahul Gandhi in which he asked if the country’s foreign policy is about Adani’s business expansion policy.

On Tuesday, more than 16 Opposition parties would met in Rajya Sabha’s Leader of the Opposition and Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge’s office to chart out the next course of action on the Adani issue. The Leaders are discussing proposals like getting all Opposition MPs to sign on a joint petition or march to the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Opposition parties have been arguing that while the Modi government has been using Central agencies to target their leaders, the same agencies have hardly acted on allegations against the Adani group.

“Is the objective of India’s foreign policy to make Adani richer? In the last nine years, Modi ji has kept India in bhram (misled) and Adani in vishwa bhraman (world travel) along with him,” Mr. Gandhi asked in a video even as the BJP insisted on an apology for his ‘democracy under attack’ comment at Cambridge University.

Separately, as part of the Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun (HAHK) series, Congress communications chief Jairam Ramesh cited a March 13 reply of the Finance Ministry to a Parliament question on Department of Revenue Intelligence investigations against the Adani group for ‘over invoicing’ of coal imports from Indonesia and asked why it has taken eight years for the DRI to complete its investigation.

House proceedings

As proceedings in both the Houses remained paralysed, Mr. Ramesh said in a tweet, “Modi Government’s continued refusal to even allow the combined Opposition to raise its legitimate demand for a JPC into the PM-linked Adani ‘MagaMegaScam’ has resulted in an impasse in Parliament. This is the only issue. Anything else is a deliberate diversion by the PM & his colleagues”.

The tone for the Opposition’s aggressive response to the government’s attack on Mr. Gandhi was a stance set at a series of meetings. First, the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP), presided by Sonia Gandhi, met at the party office in Parliament House and it was followed by a meeting of floor leaders at Mr. Kharge’s chamber.

Leaders of 16 parties, including the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Janata Dal (U), the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Nationalist Congress Party, the Samjwadi Patry, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), the Aam Aadmi Party, the CPI, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the MDMK, the NC, and the Kerala Congress, decided to raise the Adani matter in the House.

Though the Trinamool Congress did not attend the meeting but its members protested in front of the the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Parliament complex and held banners that read “Stop protecting Adani”.

DRI probe into Adani

As part of the HAHK series, Mr. Ramesh posed fresh three questions pertaining to the DRI probe allegations of “over invoicing” of imported coal from Indonesia.

“Why has it taken more than eight years for this report to be finished and will you permit the DRI to make its potentially damning contents public? Or is this another instance of you allowing your cronies to siphon ₹5,468 crore in inflated capital costs, to be ultimately borne by consumers and taxpayers,” he asked.

“How long will your cronies be allowed to steal from the people of India to fill your party’s coffers?” Mr. Ramesh added.","On Tuesday, more than 16 Opposition parties would met in Rajya Sabha’s Leader of the Opposition and Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge’s office to chart out the next course of action on the Adani issue.

Workers took to the streets and intensified their criticism of the government.

The demonstrations focused on the controversy surrounding Gautam Adani and the Hindenburg project.

In Odisha, the Congress leaders staged a protest called 'Chalo Raj Bhavan' against the ruling BJP-led central government, citing the Adani-Hindenburg issue as the main point of contention.

As per media reports, demonstrations by workers of the Haryana Congress and Punjab Congress led to the detention of many of them.

Earlier, the party had demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe into the concerned matter.

Earlier on March 1, Mumbai police had detained the state Congress president Ashok Jagtap, and senior leader Charan Singh Sapra for protesting over the Hindenburg-Adani row.

Adani Enterprises announced on February 1 that it would not proceed with its fully subscribed Follow-on Public Offer (FPO). Group chairman Gautam Adani stated on February 2 that it would be ""morally incorrect"" to proceed with the ₹20,000-crore share offer in the current market condition.

On January 24, a report by a New York-based short seller accused the Adani Group of engaging in brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud, among other things. The report expressed concerns about the possibility of shares of Adani Group companies declining from their current levels due to high valuations.

The Adani Group responded to Hindenburg's report by stating that it was not an attack on any particular company, but rather a ""calculated attack"" on India, its growth story, and its aspirations. The Group further asserted that the report was ""nothing but a lie.""

The cases involve evasion of Service Tax, non-payment/short payment of GST under the reverse charge mechanism, and ineligible Input Tax Credit.",[],"['power', 'dri', 'tax', 'adani', 'sought', 'pending', 'taxes', 'group', 'groups', 'investigation', 'authorities', 'probe', 'imports', 'service', 'companies', 'coal', 'indonesian', 'concludes']"

Adani or the foreign bank thing are very temporary...,None,Bull Market: Don't blame SVB or Adani for dull market; broad bull market unlikely in India anytime soon: Shankar Sharma,"“The Adani Group or SVB was not the reason why the Indian markets have been somnolent in the last two or three months.. The reasons are more internal. The reasons are that there is a slowdown in the economy based on the GDP numbers that we have seen,” says market veteranYes, you can call it the midpoint. It is a very boring sideways market. It might look exciting because it has been down from the peaks a bit, but it has been a very slow grinding fall most of the time. So yes, it has been quiet. And quiet is good. There is no reason to come to the market for excitement.2008 was the first time we saw a banking crisis of that order in living memory. There can be routine failures; in India too, in 2000 Global Trust Bank failed. In ‘90s also, a couple of banks failed. Those are individual events. In the US, there have been a lot of bank failures. There are community banks. The US is a huge country like India and there are small banks serving the local community. They keep going burst if you look at the data.But 2008 was a completely different animal in which there was a large-scale collapse of the financial system itself, not just lending banks but investment banks and brokers and everything. Everything from Merrill Lynch to Lehman to Washington Mutual to AIG, which is an insurance company. It was a completely different order of magnitude. Compared to that, we would take SVB or the Signature Bank collapse any day.The other thing is regulators learn to act very quickly. There is always learning with a new event. So, 2008 will not get repeated by any stretch. I mean, let us not even start thinking like that.I completely agree with that. I do not think SVB is the problem. If indeed you want to look for problems, the problems may well be more internal to India than an external shock like a large-scale banking contagion in the US. That will have its occasional day in the sun, but that is not the reason why India has underperformed this year. It is a completely different set of reasons altogether.I think Adani was a non-issue for any serious investor in the stock markets. We made it an issue beyond what it deserved to be. It is a large group, but still one group and one group cannot be said to be representative of the entire market, no matter which group that is. We have had governance problems with Infosys . We have had governance problems with Reliance, not one, but maybe a dozen of them. Sebi has passed orders against Reliance promoters, against Mukesh Ambani or against Reliance company or group companies. Sun Pharma , a marquee company, has had a series of problems in the last three-four years’ time. None of that has been represented in the public eye as if that is going to dent the image of India or is an attack on India. It is all complete and total nonsense. This is a group problem. The group is dealing with it and more power to them. They are important for the growth of certain parts of India, which is the infrastructure part and I hope and I pray that they come out of it. But to extend that to say the market is going to suffer because of that is a complete non sequitur in my view.We draw false positives and false correlations and causalities. The Adani Group or SVB was not the reason why the Indian markets have been somnolent in the last two or three months’ time. The reasons are more internal. The reasons are that there is a slowdown in the economy based on the GDP numbers that we have seen. The markets have been sensing that and I speak to companies all the time and right after Diwali, from Diwali onward last year, I started to get a sense that there was a slowdown in spending.Rural economy has been hurting in any case. It was urban spending which was propping it up and that has also started to slow down. That is where the market started to get a bit jittery. It is not Adani, it is not a foreign bank contagion.You are absolutely spot on. The competition for the market is the fixed income part, it is a much detested cousin because all of us are equity guys. We do not like fixed income in most part, but it is providing in India and globally some amazing returns. In the US, like I tweeted, you can buy good quality bond ETFs for now for about 5%, 5.5%, 6% yields, even 7% yields. Real estate investment interests are like 9%, 10%, 11%, 12% yields.In Singapore also, you can get fairly decent yields. In India, the yields are really mouth-watering to say the least which provide you low volatility returns for an average investor. Again, that is a good reason to attribute the equity markets’ underperformance in India. Adani or the foreign bank thing are very temporary phenomena, it is more fundamental and which is that rates are very attractive and people are at this point choosing fixed income over equities.Again, I go back to my point that the economy being what it is, my belief is you are not going to get a broad bull market. I do not think any of us should hold out hope that we are going to see a broad bull market in India anytime soon. We are going to see very patchy markets in which a reasonable part of the markets will be flat or even down, while small pockets of stocks whether in the Nifty or below the Nifty will be doing well and that is really the skill of your investment acumen will be tested this year.","“The Adani Group or SVB was not the reason why the Indian markets have been somnolent in the last two or three months..

The Wire,2023-03-16 14:18:45.494239,Adani Group to Halt Some Investments: Report,https://thewire.in/business/adani-group-to-halt-some-investments-report,"The research firm said that four of the Adani firms – Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Enterprises – have negative free cash...",None,Adani Group to Halt Some Investments: Report,"New Delhi: The Adani Group has decided to halt some of its proposed investments, especially those without funding commitments, Mint reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The newspaper reported that the company is going to focus on the projects which have already started.

The group has cut its growth target and capital expenditure after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, in its report, accused the company of accounting fraud, stock manipulation and improper use of offshore entities. Adani has strongly denied the allegations.

It also withdrew a Rs 20,000-crore share sale, which was fully subscribed.

The research firm said that four of the Adani firms – Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Enterprises – have negative free cash flows.

Negative free cash flow means that a business has more outgoing money than incoming, and that sales alone cannot cover the expenses. So, the business needs money from investments and financing to make up the difference.

Following the Hindenburg report, Adani Group faced a stock rout which halved the company’s market valuation. And the company started prepaying share-backed loans, possibly, to regain investors’ confidence.

Meanwhile, it’s halting some proposed investments and acquisitions.

For instance, Adani Power called off the acquisition of DB Power for around Rs 7,000 crore after missing the latest deadline to complete the transaction, the Financial Times reported on February 16.

The conglomerate, in its quarterly earnings calls, had said that it would scale back capital expenditure and won’t make any new commitments till the volatility period settles.

Among the projects the group has decided to delay are under Adani New Industries Ltd, Mint reported.

This comes after TotalEnergies put a hold on its $50-billion hydrogen project investment in Adani Group after Hindenburg Research released its report. The French oil giant was expected to buy a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Ltd for $50 billion (around Rs 4.1 lakh crore) to be invested for over 10 years.

“It makes no sense to add more (projects) until there is clarity. Adani has to explain the allegations [by Hindenburg Research],” chief executive of the French oil giant Patrick Pouyanne said, the Hindu Businessline reported.

Separately, the Financial Times reported that Adani Group halted the $847 million (approximately Rs 7,000 crore) acquisition of a coal-fired power station in India.

The report added that it’s a sign that the billionaire’s business empire is slowing down spending following a short seller attack.

Adani Group had in August last year agreed to buy DB Power, and its parent company Diliigent Power Ltd.

Diliigent Power has set up a coal-fired power plant in Chhattisgarh, through DB Power, which is a special purpose vehicle. Diliigent’s owners also run newspaper business, the Bhaskar Group.

Meanwhile, Adani Group has been prepaying some loans in the form of share-backed pledges, commercial papers, etc.

The company prepaid loans worth $1.11 billion (approximately Rs 9,200 crore) on February 6, thus releasing pledged shares ahead of their maturity of September 2024.

It also repaid a part of its commercial papers from some domestic mutual funds ahead of their maturity, the Morning Context reported. Commercial papers are unsecured, short-term debt instruments issued by companies to finance short-term liabilities.

The move is, however, one of the ways to convey that all is well in the company. Otherwise, buying back CPs doesn’t make much sense, an executive at a fund house with exposure to Adani Group’s CPs told the Morning Context.

On March 13, Monday, out of the seven Adani stocks, three were in the red.

Adani Enterprises was down by 1.20%, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone by 2.42%, and Adani Wilmar 3.95% on the BSE. Adani Transmission was up by 5%, Adani Power 4.99%, Adani Green 5%, and Adani Total Gas 5%.

Sensex was down 1.52% to close at 58,237.85, while Nifty50 was down 1.49% to close at 17,154.30.","New Delhi: The Adani Group has decided to halt some of its proposed investments, especially those without funding commitments, Mint reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The BSE Sensex dropped 344.29 points, or 0.59 per cent, to 57,555.90. The NSE Nifty plunged over 71 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 16,972.15



Select stocks such as Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, Tata Steel and Lupin were on traders' radar. Here is what Laxmikant Shukla, Technical Research Analyst at YES Securities has to say on the three stocks ahead of Thursday's trading session.

Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone | Buy | Target Price: Rs 760 | Support: Rs 610

After witnessing a sharp correction, Adani Ports has given a strong pullback. The stock has breached 20- and 50-DMAs on the daily chart, indicating strength. The scrip has started consolidating in the Rs 660-640 zone and is maintaining its support of Rs 620 with decent volume. From the indicator point of view, the daily RSI has made a bullish crossover, confirming the bullish stance. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 675-665 with an upside target of Rs 760. One can keep a stop loss of Rs 610 on a closing basis.



Tata Steel | Buy | Target Price: Rs 124 | Support: Rs 101

Tata Steel looks lucrative after showing correction around 17 per cent since it hit a high of Rs 124 January 19. The stock has bottomed out near the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the previous leg from the support zone of Rs 101-103. Further, the upside movement is getting better with the RSI indicating a decent prominent reversal pattern from the highly oversold zone. A bullish crossover on MACD is signalling ‘buy’. One can buy and accumulate the stock for an upside initial target of Rs 116, keeping a stop loss at Rs 101 on a closing basis. Any further strength in Tata Steel can lift on the counter to Rs 124 level.



Lupin | Caution | Resistance: Rs 720 | Support: Rs 635

Lupin has given a rising channel breakdown from its swing high of Rs 785. It has fallen more than 16 per cent from its recent swing high. The sharp selloff has dragged it below all its significant moving averages. Going ahead, if the support zone of Rs 645-635 is protected, an oversold bounce shall be expected towards Rs 720 levels where its upcoming resistance stands. On the flip side, a failure to hold the mentioned support would weaken the stock further and it can slip down till Rs 580-590 zone.

The fresh report, quoting multiple banking sources directly aware of discussions with potential investors, has come at a time when another report, this time by PTI, suggested the group has suspended work on a Rs 34,900 crore petrochemical project in Gujarat's Mundra.

As per ET, the group is engaged in exploratory talks with potential overseas investors, such as global insurance firms, to privately place longer-tenor bonds of up to 30-year maturities. The bonds will carry fixed coupon rates. The report suggested that the group has shortlisted two bond tranches, amounting to $500 million and $650 million, respectively, of Adani Green Energy and Adani Ports & SEZ, to begin with. The group believes there will be a reasonably good appetite for its bonds in the private market since most of the debt is backed by strong cash flows, as per the ET report.

Another report by PTI on Sunday suggested that the Gautam Adani-led group has decided not to pursue the Gujarat project, for the time being and that it has sent emails to vendors and suppliers to suspend all activities on an immediate basis. The Adani group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises had in 2021 incorporated Mundra Petrochem, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for setting up a greenfield coal-to-PVC plant at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) land in Kutch, Gujarat.

As per PTI, the group was re-evaluating various projects being implemented in different business verticals. Based on future cashflow and finance, some of the projects are being re-evaluated for its continuation and revision in timeline, PTI suggested the group as saying.

Adani's unit was to have a poly-vinyl-chloride (PVC) production capacity of 2,000 KTPA (kilo tonne per annum) requiring 3.1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of coal that was to be imported from Australia, Russia, and other countries, the news agency said.

New Delhi, March 17

The Congress claimed on Friday that the National Stock Exchange (NSE) has lifted additional surveillance on some Adani Group company stocks and asked why stock exchange regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is standing by and allowing investors to take on added exposure to such stocks.

Congress general secretary, communications Jairam Ramesh posed questions on Twitter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Adani issue as part of the opposition party’s “Hum Adanike Hain Kaun” series.

“Another day of adjournment and protest. The PM-linked Adani ‘Maha Mega Scam’ continues to be the subject of agitation by the Opposition and stonewalling by the Government. Here is HAHK (Hum Adanike Hain Kaun)-31. Chuppi Todiye Pradhan Mantriji,” Ramesh said in a tweet.

He claimed that even as global index providers such as MSCI, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell reviewed the position of the Adani stocks in their equity indices, the NSE went the other way and included five Adani Group companies in no less than 14 indices beginning Monday (March 20), as pointed out in the HAHK series on February 20.

This week, Ramesh claimed, the NSE announced that Adani Enterprises, Adani Power and Adani Wilmar would, from Friday (March 17), exit the additional surveillance mechanism framework that was put in place to protect investors from excessive risk.

“Surely the timing is not a coincidence? Why is SEBI standing by as the NSE chooses to protect the Adani Group’s interests rather than that of lakhs of small investors? Why is SEBI allowing index investors to take on additional exposure to Adani Group stocks when financial advisors, who generally wealthier investors can afford, have been advising their clients to avoid investing in Adani Group stocks?” the Congress leader asked.

In another poser made by Ramesh, he said almost a month after the revelations of wrongdoing in the Adani Group, the CEO of the Bank of Baroda said the bank would continue to lend money to the business conglomerate led by industrialist Gautam Adani.

“This statement came at a time when the value of Adani collateral in the form of pledged stock had collapsed by more than half, prompting margin calls by big global lenders concerned about repayment and fresh questions about the group’s ability to service and repay its huge debt. Note that the Bank of Baroda is a leading public sector bank that is owned by the people of India, not by PM Modi or the CEO.

“Was this yet another case of phone banking by your government? Is it true that the CEO was subsequently asked to clarify his statement by Members of Parliament on 6 March 2023 at a historic south Indian location, and if so, will you share his answer with the people of India?” Ramesh asked.

The Rajya Sabha MP of the Congress also said the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) was set up in 1982 to oversee the state’s “minor ports”, “but appears to have simply become another instrument for the enrichment of your cronies”.

Citing a 2014 Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, he said it had found that Adani Ports had benefitted to the tune of Rs 118.12 crore after the GMB applied incorrect royalty rates to a newly-built quay at the Mundra port.

“More importantly, the CAG found that ‘no system to monitor the construction activities at the private ports was in existence and that the MIS did not provide performance-related details on the activities of the ports’. The benefit to Adani Ports, the dominant ports player in the state, of this non-existent monitoring may therefore have been many multiples of the observed Rs 118 crore,” he said.

The Congress leader has so far posed 93 questions to the government under the HAHK series.

The opposition party is seeking to corner the BJP-led Centre on the Adani issue ever since US-based short seller Hindenburg Research came up with a research paper alleging financial irregularities and stock manipulation by the business group.

The Adani Group has rejected the allegations and denied any wrongdoing.

Details here,"Adani Group's two stocks will be put under the first stage of the long-term additional surveillance measures (ASM) from Monday (20 March 2023), according to stock exchanges.

The BSE and NSE in their circulars said the two securities will be moved from the long-term ASM framework Stage II to Stage I from March 20.

Last week, both NDTV and Adani Green Energy were put under the long-term ASM framework Stage II from Stage I.

Yesterday, the ports-to-power conglomerate's three stocks were removed from the National Stock exchange's short-term ASM framework. These included Adani Power, Adani Wilmar, and Adani Enterprises, respectively.

Last month, Adani Ports and SEZ, and Ambuja Cements were also placed under the short-term additional surveillance measure to control stocks' volatility.

ASM is an initiative by Sebi and exchanges wherein the securities are moved to the either short-term or long-term framework to protect the interest of investors. Adani Group's stock has been put under the ASM framework due to high volatility post the HIndenburg's report.

In the short-term ASM, there are two stages. Stocks are retained in each stage as applicable for a minimum period of 5/15 trading sessions and are eligible for review from the 6th/16th trading day onwards.

The securities are further monitored and moved in trade-to-trade (T2T Segment) and 100% of traded value will get blocked as margins, which means that no intraday leverage is given.

The parameters for shortlisting securities under the ASM framework include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close-to-close price variation, and price earning ratio.

On Friday, seven of Adani Group's stocks were settled in green while four closed in the red.

New Delhi, March 17

The Congress claimed on Friday that the National Stock Exchange (NSE) has lifted additional surveillance on some Adani Group company stocks and asked why stock exchange regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is standing by and allowing investors to take on added exposure to such stocks.

Congress general secretary, communications Jairam Ramesh posed questions on Twitter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Adani issue as part of the opposition party’s “Hum Adanike Hain Kaun” series.

“Another day of adjournment and protest. The PM-linked Adani ‘Maha Mega Scam’ continues to be the subject of agitation by the Opposition and stonewalling by the Government. Here is HAHK (Hum Adanike Hain Kaun)-31. Chuppi Todiye Pradhan Mantriji,” Ramesh said in a tweet.

He claimed that even as global index providers such as MSCI, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell reviewed the position of the Adani stocks in their equity indices, the NSE went the other way and included five Adani Group companies in no less than 14 indices beginning Monday (March 20), as pointed out in the HAHK series on February 20.

This week, Ramesh claimed, the NSE announced that Adani Enterprises, Adani Power and Adani Wilmar would, from Friday (March 17), exit the additional surveillance mechanism framework that was put in place to protect investors from excessive risk.

“Surely the timing is not a coincidence? Why is SEBI standing by as the NSE chooses to protect the Adani Group’s interests rather than that of lakhs of small investors? Why is SEBI allowing index investors to take on additional exposure to Adani Group stocks when financial advisors, who generally wealthier investors can afford, have been advising their clients to avoid investing in Adani Group stocks?” the Congress leader asked.

In another poser made by Ramesh, he said almost a month after the revelations of wrongdoing in the Adani Group, the CEO of the Bank of Baroda said the bank would continue to lend money to the business conglomerate led by industrialist Gautam Adani.

“This statement came at a time when the value of Adani collateral in the form of pledged stock had collapsed by more than half, prompting margin calls by big global lenders concerned about repayment and fresh questions about the group’s ability to service and repay its huge debt. Note that the Bank of Baroda is a leading public sector bank that is owned by the people of India, not by PM Modi or the CEO.

“Was this yet another case of phone banking by your government? Is it true that the CEO was subsequently asked to clarify his statement by Members of Parliament on 6 March 2023 at a historic south Indian location, and if so, will you share his answer with the people of India?” Ramesh asked.

The Rajya Sabha MP of the Congress also said the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) was set up in 1982 to oversee the state’s “minor ports”, “but appears to have simply become another instrument for the enrichment of your cronies”.

Citing a 2014 Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, he said it had found that Adani Ports had benefitted to the tune of Rs 118.12 crore after the GMB applied incorrect royalty rates to a newly-built quay at the Mundra port.

“More importantly, the CAG found that ‘no system to monitor the construction activities at the private ports was in existence and that the MIS did not provide performance-related details on the activities of the ports’. The benefit to Adani Ports, the dominant ports player in the state, of this non-existent monitoring may therefore have been many multiples of the observed Rs 118 crore,” he said.

The Congress leader has so far posed 93 questions to the government under the HAHK series.

The opposition party is seeking to corner the BJP-led Centre on the Adani issue ever since US-based short seller Hindenburg Research came up with a research paper alleging financial irregularities and stock manipulation by the business group.

The Adani Group has rejected the allegations and denied any wrongdoing.

Details here,"Adani Group's two stocks will be put under the first stage of the long-term additional surveillance measures (ASM) from Monday (20 March 2023), according to stock exchanges.

The BSE and NSE in their circulars said the two securities will be moved from the long-term ASM framework Stage II to Stage I from March 20.

Last week, both NDTV and Adani Green Energy were put under the long-term ASM framework Stage II from Stage I.

Yesterday, the ports-to-power conglomerate's three stocks were removed from the National Stock exchange's short-term ASM framework. These included Adani Power, Adani Wilmar, and Adani Enterprises, respectively.

Last month, Adani Ports and SEZ, and Ambuja Cements were also placed under the short-term additional surveillance measure to control stocks' volatility.

ASM is an initiative by Sebi and exchanges wherein the securities are moved to the either short-term or long-term framework to protect the interest of investors. Adani Group's stock has been put under the ASM framework due to high volatility post the HIndenburg's report.

In the short-term ASM, there are two stages. Stocks are retained in each stage as applicable for a minimum period of 5/15 trading sessions and are eligible for review from the 6th/16th trading day onwards.

The securities are further monitored and moved in trade-to-trade (T2T Segment) and 100% of traded value will get blocked as margins, which means that no intraday leverage is given.

The parameters for shortlisting securities under the ASM framework include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close-to-close price variation, and price earning ratio.

On Friday, seven of Adani Group's stocks were settled in green while four closed in the red.

On March 15, 16 Opposition parties including the Congress, Aam Admi Party and Bharat Rashtra Samithi marched from Parliament to submit a complaint to the ED against the Adani Group, alleging “serious corporate fraud, political corruption, stock-price manipulation and the misuse and monopolization of public resources”.

In the meeting before the march, a NCP representative was present but did not sign the complaint. The NCP had reservations on an issue related to a development project in Mumbai, as it was a pet project of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in which the erstwhile Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress were partners, two Congress leaders said, requesting anonymity.

“The NCP leader present in the meeting told us that they are with us in spirit but not in body, indicating their reluctance to join the march,” said a Congress leader. Another opposition leader present in the meeting said that the NCP leaders tried to get party supremo Sharad Pawar sign the petition, but couldn’t reach him.

“The NCP is a trusted ally of the Congress, unlike the Trinamool. The TMC doesn’t attend any meeting of the opposition and tried to dilute the Adani-Hindenburg issue by demanding a court-monitored probe, even as all other opposition parties have been demanding a JPC (joint parliamentary committee),” said a second Congress leader.

In its letter to the ED, the opposition flagged the network of offshore shell companies allegedly involved in stock manipulation and money laundering, the AdiCorp’s funnelling of funds from the Adani Group back to Adani Power, the lack of investigation into the 3,000kg drugs haul from Mundra port, and the Adani Group’s improper influence to obtain concessions and contracts from governments.

After demanding a JPC and seeking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reply on a number of questions regarding the Adani Group, the Congress and key opposition parties lodged a formal complaint against the conglomerate to a federal investigative agency that investigates financial crimes.

The Congress, with many of its leaders under the ED’s scanner, reminded the agency how in the recent past it “has zealously pursued cases of alleged political favouritism including sharing concurrent jurisdiction with SEBI and CBI.” The ED on occasion works with the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the country’s market regulator, to nab violators.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s videos on industrialist Gautam Adani have fewer views despite similar user engagement as other videos, the Congress has said in a letter to YouTube. The party has further alleged that the browse feature for these specific videos seem to have been “algorithmically suppressed”.

Sam Pitroda, chairperson of the Indian Overseas Congress, has flagged the issue in a letter to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan. Mr. Gandhi’s team, Mr. Pitroda wrote in the letter, finds it a “bit bizarre and are searching for an explanation”. “They have used YouTube’s own data and analytics to show that viewership of videos of Mr. Adani are being suppressed, perhaps unwittingly and algorithmically,” he added.

To support its claim, the Congress party has also submitted a brief presentation analysing the viewership data of the video series on Mr. Adani, called ‘ Mitr Kaal’, versus his video from the Bharat Jodo Yatra.

The positive interactions of the Bharat Jodo Yatra video at 83,602 is less than that of ‘ Mitr Kaal‘ episode one at 99,197 and yet, the party pointed out that while the Bharat Jodo Yatra video got over 20 lakh views, the ‘ Mitr Kaal‘ video got only 4.78 lakh views. According to the party’s presentation, positive interactions have an 89% to increase views.

Similarly, the second episode in the series have double the interactions of Mr. Gandhi’s Cambridge video but similar number of views.

The party has alleged systematic “algorithmic suppression”. Most people see videos through the ‘YouTube Browse’ feature, where the home page throws in recommendations. In the case of Mr. Gandhi’s channel, the party claims this feature has been down since February 9.

Data compiled by independent social media analytics firm Social Blade confirms this trend in declining views of Mr. Gandhi videos. According to the firm, the monthly views for Mr. Gandhi’s videos increased from 4.6 lakh in September 2022 to over 33 million in January 2023.

However, the number of subscribers added to his channel on a 30-day rolling basis declined two-thirds compared with the previous month, and the video views in the last 30 days have decreased by over 59%.

ASM is an initiative by Sebi and exchanges wherein the securities are moved to either short-term or long-term framework to protect the interest of investors



On the other hand, Adani Group's two stocks will be put under the first stage of the long-term additional surveillance measures (ASM) from Monday, March 20, 2023, according to stock exchanges. The BSE and NSE in their circulars said the two securities will be moved from the long-term ASM framework Stage II to Stage I from March 20.



However, NSE did not name or mention any particular group or company in its statement issue. Stocks are put under the additional surveillance framework by exchanges to safeguard investors amid high volatility. Interestingly, Adani Group's stocks have been put under the ASM framework due to high volatility post the Hindenburg's report.



This entire framework has been time-tested. Further, any changes to the said rules are also pre-announced before any future action on basis of new rules becomes applicable, the exchange clarified in its statement.

Her tweet came hours after Adani Group clarified that Vinod Adani is part of the promoter group, after questions were raised about his status following a report by The Morning Context, which said Vinod Adani is the ultimate beneficiary of ACC and Ambuja Cements, not Adani Group. US short seller Hindenburg Research also named him prominently in its scathing report on the Adani Group.

The group had last year acquired Swiss-based Holcim’s cement businesses in India – Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd – for $10.5 billion (around Rs 85,000 crore).

'We would like to submit that Gautam Adani and Rajesh Adani are individual promoters of various listed entities within the Adani group and Vinod Adani is an immediate relative of the individual promoters,'' the group's flagship arm Adani Enterprises said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday.

Accordingly, as per the applicable Indian regulations, ''Vinod Adani is part of the 'promoter group' of various listed entities within the Adani group.'' In response to Hindenburg questioning the role of Vinod Adani, 74, in the Adani group where it alleged ''brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud'' and use of offshore shell companies to inflate stock prices, the apples-to-airport conglomerate had in January said that ''Vinod Adani does not hold any managerial position in Adani listed entities or their subsidiaries and has no role in their day to day affairs.'' ''We reiterate that any transactions by the Adani portfolio companies with any related party have been duly identified and disclosed as related party transactions in compliance with Indian laws and standard and have been carried out on arm's length terms,'' it had said.

When asked by a Twitter user what his agrument is, Singh said: ""Dear Sir, promoter is defined to outline corporate control and thus behaviour in the public markets including type of disclosure.

Hindenburg Research had alleged that Vinod Adani was responsible for creating and managing a vast network of offshore shell entities meant for stock parking, market manipulation and laundering money, to help the conglomerate's companies maintain their appearance of financial health.

The group has denied all Hindenburg allegations, calling them ''malicious'', ''baseless'' and a ''calculated attack on India'' but it still led to a $130-billion erosion of m-cap of the listed Adani firms.

Vinod Adani is widely reported to be working out of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Regulatory filings show he is a Cypriot national.

When Adani Group bought Swiss giant Holcim AG's stake in Ambuja Cements and ACC, the deal was completed via a Mauritius-based entity called Endeavour Trade and Investment.

In the filing, Adani Group said the fact that Vinod Adani was part of the promoter group had been submitted to Indian regulatory authorities from time to time in various disclosures.

''Further, the fact that Endeavour Trade and Investment Limited (an entity controlled by Vinod Adani), the acquirer of ACC Limited and Ambuja Cements Limited, belongs to the Adani group has been disclosed in the public offer document,'' it added.

Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) branding those who raise questions against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adani Group head Gautam Adani as anti-national, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury questioned the Union government’s reluctance to agree to the Opposition’s demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) into alleged irregularities in the corporate group.

He was speaking at a public meeting marking the conclusion of the Statewide Janakeeya Prathirodha Yatra led by CPI(M) State secretary M.V. Govindan here on Saturday.

“In the days of Emergency, we heard the slogan of Indira is India and India is Indira. Today, Modi is giving us the slogan of Modi-Adani are India and India is Modi-Adani. The people of India will give them a fitting reply, as they had given Indira Gandhi back then with the removal of the government from office. Questioning the government of the day is the duty of every Indian patriot. This dangerous equation has to be defeated. On the one hand, their government says nothing is wrong with the dealings of the Adani group. Yet, they are not allowing the JPC, because they have a lot to hide,” Mr. Yechury said.

“When the BJP was in Opposition, Parliament was stalled for an entire session to demand a JPC for the 2G scam, which was constituted. Each JPC has given recommendations that were helpful for the system,” said Mr. Yechury.

He said the communal-corporate nexus that had emerged under the Modi government was destroying the four pillars of the country’s Constitutional order — secular democracy, economic self sovereignty, social justice, and federalism. The worst form of crony capitalism had been unleashed, as exemplified by the Adani scam.

“The government is now using various agencies to target and intimidate Opposition leaders. Since 2014, more than 3,554 cases have been filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Of these, only 23 received convictions in court. Miraculously, the cases against those leaders who join the BJP vanish immediately. The BJP has found a new principle in democracy that whoever wins the elections, the BJP will form the government,” he said.","He was speaking at a public meeting marking the conclusion of the Statewide Janakeeya Prathirodha Yatra led by CPI(M) State secretary M.V.

The Adani Group’s rise to become one of the top business empires in the world might have seen an unprecedented surge in the last nine years

By Telangana Today Published Date - 08:35 PM, Sun - 19 March 23

The Adani Group’s rise to become one of the top business empires in the world might have seen an unprecedented surge in the last nine years. But fraud, right from siphoning funds offshore and market manipulation of share prices of the group in India, are nothing new to the group.

In fact, the Adani Group’s shady affairs were revealed as early as in 1999, when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence arrested Rajesh Adani, a younger brother of Gautam Adani and currently the managing director of the Adani Group, on charges of evading customs duties. He was arrested several times again, on charges of customs fraud too, most recently in 2013.

The DRI also investigated the 2004-06 diamond scam, in which Rajesh Adani and Gautam Adani’s brother-in-law Samir Vora were accused of circular trading of diamonds and over-invoicing so as to siphon funds to tax havens like Dubai and Singapore, and also of fraudulently claiming export subsidies.

In 2013, the Commissioner of Customs imposed fines on Rajesh Adani, Samir Vora, Adani Enterprises and five diamond trading companies linked to the Adani Group.

However, in 2015, soon after the Modi government came to power, the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) dismissed the findings of investigations that spanned several years.

Much before that, in 2007, the Adani Group was banned by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) from participation in the securities market for two years.

The SEBI passed the order after it found the involvement of promoters of Adani — along with controversial stock broker Ketan Parekh and his associates — in the price rigging of Adani stocks between October 1999 and March 2001.

DRI investigation still pending before SC



In 2013-14, intelligence was gathered by the DRI that certain power sector companies were involved in over-invoicing of coal and power generation equipment imported from abroad.

It was detected that Indonesian coal was shipped directly to India but the import invoices were routed by the companies through one or more intermediaries based in countries such as Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong etc., for the artificial inflation of value, which ultimately impacted the power bills of end users through passing on of costs.

The coal import scam was estimated to be at around Rs.29,000 crore. The objective of over-valuation appeared to have been to siphon off money abroad and to avail higher power tariff compensation based on the artificially-inflated cost of the imported coal.

A general alert circular was issued in March 2016 about the modus operandi of over-invoicing of Indonesian coal indulged in by some 40 companies. The circular listed names of 40 companies, out of which 10 entities (including suppliers), were directly related to Adani.

As the next step, the DRI in 2016 obtained a Letters Rogatory (LR), which is sent by a country under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) for the assistance of foreign judicial authorities in probing an offshore entity.

Accordingly, the DRI petitioned the governments of Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong for assistance in gaining access to the overseas bank records of state-owned Indian banks whose accounts were used to facilitate the scam.

Almost 85 percent of the fraudulent over-invoicing done by these companies took place through SBI’s Singapore branch, according to the DRI.

Despite having clinching evidence in hand, the DRI’s probe reached a dead end due to the non-cooperation of banks, citing reasons of international legal agreements with the countries concerned.

“It looks like an ‘invisible outside hand’ is stopping it from happening,” one of the officials was quoted as saying by India Today.

Adani challenged the LR request in one of his group firms, Adani Enterprises Ltd, in the Singapore lower court, which disagreed and ordered the company to turn over its records. Adani appealed against the order in the Singapore High Court and failed there as well.

However, where he succeeded was at the Bombay High Court, where he challenged the issuance of the LR itself, following which the HC quashed all LR proceedings citing technicalities. The Supreme Court stayed the order of the Bombay High Court in 2020.

Earlier, two firms of the Adani Group, allegedly involved in over-valuation of imported power equipment, were served show cause notices on May 15, 2014.

The DRI stated that the goods — power generation and transmission equipment — imported by the firms (APML and APRL) in 2009 and 2010, were shipped directly to India by original equipment manufacturers based in China and South Korea, while the documents were routed through an intermediary entity, Electrogen Infra FZE, UAE (EIF), created in Dubai.

The value of the equipment was inflated by nearly 400 percent ie, Rs.4,000 cr. According to the DRI, EIF was owned and controlled by Vinod Shantilal Adani, the eldest of the Adani brothers.

The DRI alleged that the Adani firms transacted with EIF, a related party, to siphon off Rs.4000 crore abroad.

However, at the first appellate level, the Commissioner disposed of the case in 2017 in favour of Adani. The second appellate CESTAT also decided in favour of Adani.

The appeals are still pending in the Supreme Court.","In fact, the Adani Group’s shady affairs were revealed as early as in 1999, when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence arrested Rajesh Adani, a younger brother of Gautam Adani and currently the managing director of the Adani Group, on charges of evading customs duties.

The occasion was the virtual inauguration of a 131.57km cross-border Indo-Bangla Friendship Pipeline, through which Bangladesh will import high-speed diesel from the Numaligarh refinery in Assam. Modi, in the presence of his counterpart Sheikh Hasina, spoke at length about the progress made in energy cooperation between their countries.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued with his silence on Adani on Saturday though he would have had every reason to mention Adani Power, whose entry into Bangladesh owed to his patronage, at an event celebrating a new phase in Delhi-Dhaka cooperation over energy.

Eight years ago, Modi had laid the groundwork for Adani Power’s entry into Bangladesh as part of India’s commitment to improving the power situation in the neighbouring country and beginning an extensive cross-border power trade.

A joint declaration issued by the external affairs ministry after Modi’s Bangladesh visit in June 2015 said: “He (Modi) also conveyed that India can be a major partner in achieving this goal and many Indian corporates have the capacity to cooperate with Bangladesh in this endeavour. He requested Prime Minister Hasina for facilitating the entry of Indian companies in the power generation, transmission and distribution sector of Bangladesh.”

Two years after Modi’s visit, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Adani Power in November 2017.

The deal was for the Indian company to supply 1,496MW of electricity from a coal-based power plant at Godda in Jharkhand.

With Adani Power (Jharkhand) having begun supplying power to Bangladesh from the Godda plant earlier this month, Modi, perceived as the architect of the cross-border power trade, would perhaps have been expected to mention the fact. But he persisted with his silence on the Adani group, which has been in the thick of controversy amid allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

The Congress accuses Modi of preferential treatment of the group because of his proximity to Adani.

“In the field of energy, our mutual cooperation has been very successful.... Today, India supplies more than 1,100MW electricity to Bangladesh,” Modi said at Saturday’s programme.

“The first unit of the Maitree super thermal power plant (a 50:50 joint venture between the BPDB and India’s NTPC) is already operational. The second unit will also be operational soon.”

Modi said the petroleum trade between the two countries had crossed $1 billion. He spoke of how the pipeline — through which Dhaka is to import diesel at a cheaper cost and with lower carbon emission — would give a push to the Bangladesh economy by facilitating the growth of both agriculture and industry.

“Under normal circumstances, a mention of the deal between Adani Power and the BPDB in the Indian Prime Minister’s address would have been natural, but we all know the controversies surrounding the group in India,” a source in Bangladesh said.

Another reason behind the act of omission could be the controversy in Bangladesh over the deal.

Segments of Bangladesh civil society and media have demanded scrapping of the purchase deal with Adani Power, calling it “unfair” and steeped in a “profiteering motive”.

Over the past one month or so, several news reports in the Bangladeshi media — based on the 163-page PPA — have contended that Dhaka would be paying through its nose for electricity from the Godda plant.

That Bangladesh authorities too had apprehensions about the cost of electricity from Adani Power (Jharkhand) became clear in recent months with the BPDB seeking revisions to the PPA, which prompted representatives of the conglomerate to rush to Dhaka at least twice to assuage the concerns.

“The Adani representatives were here last week too. They have given an assurance that the cost of electricity from their plant would be on a par with — or even cheaper than — that from other thermal power plants,” a source in Bangladesh said.

Multiple sources in the Bangladesh government said that although the PPA was “iron clad”, the process of bargaining with the Adani authorities had become easier because of the problems the conglomerate is facing in India.

“The company is likely to raise its first bill to the BPDB in April. It will become clear then that we have struck a favourable bargain after all the controversy,” a source said.

“The pipeline will play a significant role in protecting the energy security of our people and quicken the country’s development,” Hasina said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued with his silence on Adani on Saturday though he would have had every reason to mention Adani Power, whose entry into Bangladesh owed to his patronage, at an event celebrating a new phase in Delhi-Dhaka cooperation over energy.

On 16 March, it informed India’s stock market that the latter was a member of the promoter group. “We would like to submit that Mr Gautam Adani and Mr Rajesh Adani are individual promoters of various listed entities within the Adani Group and Mr Vinod Adani is an immediate relative of the individual promoters,"" its filing said. “Accordingly, as per the applicable Indian regulations, Mr Vinod Adani is part of the ‘promoter group’ of various listed entities within the Adani Group. This fact has been submitted to Indian regulatory authorities from time to time, in various disclosures."" Its rebuttal of Hindenburg’s charges, in contrast, had deflected a set of queries by saying, “Vinod Adani does not hold any managerial position in any Adani listed entities or their subsidiaries and has no role in their day to day affairs."" This, however, did not square up with one big fact: the elder brother’s control of Endeavour Trade and Investment Ltd, which acquired ACC and Ambuja Cements for about $10.5 billion from Holcim last year to mark yet another market entry by the infra-focused group. As this fraternal link had duly been disclosed, even the documentation record left Adani’s stance hollow.

Three questions assume urgency. First, did Adani violate India’s free-float norms? On paper, the group’s listed companies barely met the minimum equity of 25% that should be available for public trading. If a chunk of their float portion is found to be under Vinod Adani’s effective control via a web of offshore entities, as alleged by Hindenburg, then it would imply a failure of compliance. An episode of share-price jitters in 2021 over this suspicion prompted the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), our market regulator, to explore the need for a free-float definition that would exclude shares held by institutions as well (and not just promoters). The logic of keeping strategic interests out of the count did not get far. But it matters. After all, only a sliver of a firm’s equity pie being openly traded exposes it to easy manipulation. That leads us to the second question. Did Adani use an overseas network to manipulate its share prices? This is for a Sebi probe to answer. But we need not delve into forensic trails to identify a few tell-tale signs. Even for a blistering pace of growth, Adani scrips had zoomed off the charts in terms of their price-earning ratios, which had reached multiple hundreds in a bazaar where a ratio above 30 needs a jackpot on its way to justify such a high price. Inflated valuations do have a motive. Equity can be pledged for loans, as Adani did. Although the group has lowered its debt slightly after a share sale to Rajiv Jain’s US-based fund GQG Partners—steadying its market capitalization that had more than halved since Republic Day—what enabled its over-leverage has kept eyebrows raised.

The final question is of India’s infrastructure mega-thrust involving the private sector that could deliver what the country needs, but also has some aspects that risk creating conditions for crony capitalism. So, did Adani’s apparent status as a ‘national champion’ of sorts attract a regulatory look-away? While Adani’s sharp rise and perceived proximity to the current regime are embroiled now in a political row, the episode has put the country’s institutional framework to a test. For the sake of our bet on market democracy, we need clear answers.","In a U-turn that amplified questions raised by the Hindenburg report of 24 January, the Adani Group has quit distancing itself from its chairman Gautam Adani’s elder brother Vinod Adani.

Asserting that they had done their own due diligence in order to allay investor concerns, Jain said he didn’t feel that Adani is a very risky bet.

“We look at where these businesses are going to be in five years. We look at PEs 4-5 years down the line,” Jain said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Our job is to worry about everything. Question is what is the risk-reward value. We do our own due diligence. We did speak to some former regulators as part of our due diligence, he said, adding that the bankers they talked never mentioned ""fraud"".

Jain noted that the execution in Adani’s infrastructure projects were quite big, and importantly, their maintenance capex was very low. He underlined that they were looking at how these assets would do in five years.

He also said that they had met some of the management of Adani group through brokerage firm Jefferies.

""I believe they (Adani group) need to keep growing; it will be a mistake to stop growing. I would say, 'don’t change anything to please the market',"" Jain said.

Stating that GQG Partners have historically owned very high multiple stocks, he said that many of the allegations made in the Hindenburg report are not substantive.

“Lot of the allegations being made are totally fluff,” he said. “The Hindenburg report, if you go through the allegations, verify one by one, — the problem is that people are not doing that — the vast majority are not substantive,” Rajiv Jain said.

But Tata, Birla, Ambani, Adani, have given India brandless growth","The Adani controversy brings to our attention some related aspects of India’s political economy. The most immediate one is the opposition’s allegation of cronyism. Which, when elaborated, becomes a larger theme encompassing the top four or five leaders of corporate India.

You can add Ambani, Tata, Birla, and Vedanta to the list. All these qualify to be called conglomerates. They all have interests in diverse fields. This, to be sure, isn’t a definitive or comprehensive list.

The Tatas, for example, are often described as a salt-to-software group. They produce automobiles and military aircraft, run a massive and diverse airline business now, and also make steel.

Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Group spans a wide range of businesses too, from refining to telecom as the main course, to retail and even biosciences research, and some media thrown in the dessert trolley.

The Aditya Birla Group has interests in metals (aluminium in particular), telecom, cement, yarns and more. Vedanta is still mostly into metals but is now on the energy (oil and gas production) radar too.

All these have three things in common.

One, they are all legacy or at least family-controlled enterprises. Reliance (Ambani) and Birla are empires founded by the previous generations. Vedanta and Adani have first-generation founders who control their businesses directly. The extent to which members of the family are in control of key businesses can vary, from Adani at one extreme to Tata at the other.

Two, all these have most of their businesses in areas where the government overhang is heavy and decisive. These are highly regulated areas and often — especially in the case of Adani — monopolies by definition. Think Mumbai airport and electricity distribution, or Mundra Port, or the mega plants with power purchase agreements. The same applies to refining and telecom, mining and oilfield concessions. A direct and extensive interaction with the state is critical to these.

Third, and the most important for this week’s discussion, is that none of them owns a truly global Indian brand. There will be protests from the Tatas, I understand, because they have the Taj Hotels and now Air India is back with them. I’d say with some humility that Taj is still not a hotel brand to awe the world — probably because they work in so many categories, from super-luxury Palaces to the very working-class Ginger. And Air India was felled by the sarkari kiss of death decades ago, and it will take some doing now to bring it back to its old glory.

Much of the criticism Adani has faced in particular stems from his proximity to the Modi government, especially given how critical working with the state is for his main businesses. If running ports on India’s coast is a business fully regulated by the government, buying port assets overseas is impossible without a supportive government. Whether that’s a good thing or bad isn’t the question. In polarised debate it can often be seen as bordering on cronyism.

The Congress, for example, cites this as a case of the Modi government running foreign policy to “serve their friend Adani’s interest”. Others might see it as important that any government work closely with powerful Indian conglomerates to compete overseas, especially with a rampant China with its Belt and Road Initiative and unlimited treasury.

Similarly, think of the airports, highways, railways, tunnels, metros and much else that is being built in India now, as The Economist noted in its latest issue. You’ll need companies that have deep pockets and large balance sheets to build so much infrastructure.

Would you leave it to Bechtels of the world to come and do it for you, or would you rather have Indian conglomerates do it? Nobody can do it without working closely with the government, so that isn’t the issue. The debate, therefore, has to be about whether there is a level playing field for all comers. The Bechtels included.

This state-corporate “cooperation” (nexus if you are conspiratorially minded) didn’t begin with the arrival of the Modi government. Many of the big licences, contracts, and even environmental clearances for the Adani Group had come in the time of the UPA. Of course, they will insist they did it fairly after asking the right questions and giving all competitors an equal chance. But the fact is, there are so many areas in a growing economy with desperate hunger for infrastructure that private capital and the state will need to work closely together.

We’ve discussed the Adani case in greater detail because it is the subject of most of today’s debate. But all these conglomerates do most of their business in India, and in areas where they can’t escape the government’s shadow. Much of their revenue is domestic as well. There are exceptions, for sure, like the Tatas’ software business.

To understand this better, look at the case of the Dhamra Port on India’s still poorly served eastern seaboard. The Tatas built it in the face of heavy odds, in particular opposition from environmental activists who had a much greater say under the UPA dispensation. There were questions and litigation, ranging from whether it was consuming reserved forest land to the feared destruction of the nesting sites of Olive Ridley turtles.

The legal clearances did finally come in the UPA era, if after much delay because — despite its devotion to environmental activism — that government’s top leaders were too wise not to understand the vital need for another efficient port in the east. The UPA didn’t block it. That the Tatas finally sold it to the Adanis is another story. While many would believe the insinuation that the Tatas must’ve been arm-twisted into selling it to the Adanis, it wouldn’t pass a most elementary fact check. The deal was negotiated and concluded under UPA-II and announced on 16 May, 2014, as election results had just begun to come in.

The third point is that the failure of these super-powerful Indian corporations to build global brands is a real disappointment. We can classify brands broadly in three categories: country, company and product brands respectively. In the first category, India has some — yoga, ayurveda, spirituality maybe. Engineering and maths talent, IITs and IIMs, generic pharma. You can add more to the list.

There are powerful Indian company brands known across the world, at least in business circles: Tata, Reliance, Vedanta and some companies within the conglomerates, like TCS. Then Infosys, Wipro, HCL and other tech companies.

None of them, however, has created a product brand that rules the world. India does not have a purely homemade car, a two-wheeler, a software or operating system, not even a perfume or a beverage. We are collecting GI tags for scores of products — mostly agri and handicrafts — and yet not a brand that looks out from shop shelves globally.

Corporate India has failed to create a garment brand, and almost all that our factories produce and export is sold under the labels of international store chains. To that extent, our garment makers are also doing outsourced work. Which is precisely what the Modi government is now promising in its larger manufacturing push with incentives like PLI and other concessions.

While it’s great that India is now making a lot of mobile phones for export, none of these carries an Indian brand name. The Chinese and Koreans, on the other hand, have spawned a half-dozen brands that dominate global markets. The Modi government’s manufacturing push is very good and necessary, but basically it is pushing Indian manufacturing in the same direction as our software (services) industry: outsourcing.

Cronyism is abhorrent and it’s good that it’s now being debated so robustly. But the much bigger failure of these incredibly powerful, rich and successful companies, and of the state policy, lies in India’s fully brand-free economic growth.

The allegations triggered a massive selloff in all group company stocks, rating agencies put Adani group companies under watch, and the turmoil led to the withdrawal of Adani Enterprises’ follow-on public offering (FPO).

A fourth of the total FPO proceeds were to be used to fund airport expansion plans, according to the company’s plans reported by Mint in February. Over ₹5,200 crore was to be used to upgrade airports in Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangaluru from January 2023 to March 2024; and ₹4,165 crore for repaying fully or in part, borrowings of Adani Airports Holdings Ltd, Adani Road Transport Ltd, and Mundra Solar Ltd. It had also planned to use ₹2,660 crore from the net proceeds of the FPO for green hydrogen projects.

On Wednesday, Bansal also said that the group is looking to expand its airport portfolio and will bid in the state-owned Airports Authority of India’s next round of the public-private partnership programme for airport development. The government is planning to bring private players into the operation, management and development of about 11-13 airports and is likely to invite bids for airport pairs, including one major and a minor airport each.

“We need to see how the tariff will be filed. There are pairings of one main airport and a smaller airport. Once the tender is out, we need to study how this will work... how the tariff will apply...whether it is the same or different for both airports. We will study and make a strategy. Our strategy is simple. It is to build scale, so if the bid condition is right for us, we will bid,"" Bansal said.

For minor airports, the group will assess the merit of growth and the potential of an airport before deciding to bid for the same. “We will have to calculate how much capex we need to invest. If it makes sense, we will bid,"" he said.

In February 2019, Adani won bids to upgrade and operate six government-owned airports—Lucknow, Mangaluru, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram—for 50 years.

The seven operational airports, including the airport in Mumbai, run by the Adani group, account for 23.7% of passenger traffic in India, according to government data for December. In terms of freight carriage, the share of airports under the group stood at 30.7% in December.","Adani group companies came under the spotlight in February after US short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged accounting fraud and stock manipulation at the group, charges that the conglomerate has denied.

“We need to see the conditions of the request for quotation (RFQ), we need to see how the tariff will be applied and we will need to see how the capex will be applied. And only if it makes financial sense, will we put in a bid,” Arun Bansal, CEO of Adani Airport Holdings said Wednesday on the sidelines of the aviation summit hosted by the think tank CAPA India in New Delhi.

Out of the 25 airports identified for privatisation, the government intends floating tenders for 11 in the first phase of the bidding.

Asked how Adani Airports will be strategising to maximise the proposed synergies between two city airport pairs, Bansal said: “We need to study the bid document once it comes out to see how the pairing will be filed for the main and the smaller airports.”

In the next round of airport privatisation the government is planning to pair smaller airports with larger, more profitable ones.

Saying the group will work out a strategy only after thoroughly reviewing the tender document, Bansal remarked, “Our strategy is simple, to create a scale [of operations]. If the bid condition is right, we will bid.”

Given the rapid growth in air passenger traffic this financial year to pre-pandemic levels, operationalisation of new airports and with over 30 cities getting dual airports over the course of time, air passenger traffic will touch 1 billion by 2040, with passenger traffic growing at a CAGR of 8.5 percent over the next 20 years, according to estimates compiled by Adani Airport Holdings.

“The growth will not only be in the airports in Delhi or Mumbai or Kolkata or Bengaluru, but it will also be at regional airports,” said Bansal.

He further added that the expansion in the portfolio of airport projects by the company would result in their handling 350 million passengers annually in the next ten years.

We assume regulators, auditors and stock exchanges are doing their jobs in preventing fraud and malfeasance. Then a major scam happens, like at Enron, Volkswagen, Theranos, etc. Everyone proposes governance reforms and we think the problem is solved… until the next scandal hits.

The recent Adani scandal again highlights our need for better regulations and effective corporate governance. In 2020, much before Hindenburg’s report, allegations had arisen that the group was involved in fraud, money laundering and environmental destruction. The group was accused of concealing losses in subsidiaries, inflating profits and using complex offshore structures to avoid taxes. Over-invoiced imports to siphon money abroad was another charge. As proper oversight could have flagged such issues in time, this fiasco raises questions of corporate governance in India. The term refers to the system of rules, practices and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. It encompasses everything from the oversight role of a board of directors over its management to internal controls, audit practices and risk buffers. The goal of governance is to see that a company operates ethically, transparently and in the best interests of all stakeholders. India’s Companies Act of 2013 sets out a legal framework for it, with guidelines and rules governing various aspects.

Yet, the Adani episode exposed loopholes. The primary problem identified was a lack of independent directors, with group company boards comprising mostly family members and close associates. Another issue was lack of transparency in its financial reporting. Adani Group companies have been accused of using complex structures to evade taxes and manipulate stock prices. While India does have a robust legal framework, weak enforcement seems to be a problem. This is compounded by business ties with politics that could make it difficult for regulators to act against powerful corporate entities. The role of auditors has also been placed in a spotlight. They must verify financial statements for accuracy and reliability. However, they are often caught napping or looking away.

To address these issues, India may need to strengthen its corporate governance framework. Ties of business with politics need to be explained. Other measures should be aimed at increasing transparency in ownership structures, enhancing the independence and accountability of auditors, and improving the enforcement of rules. Regulators and policymakers must work together to create a level playing field for all businesses, regardless of their size or political connections.

Indian opposition leaders accuse the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) of laxity in investigating charges against Adani. As a regulator, it should have full independence in conducting a probe. Remember the fate of recommendations on governance made by a panel led by Uday Kotak? Powerful business lobbies got to work, their implementation was first delayed and now seems shelved. This sort of thing mustn’t happen anymore.

Given the impact on India’s stock market of charges against the Adani Group, Sebi, which was seized of questions over its adherence to free-float norms well before the Hindenburg report appeared, should have been on alert. Anyhow, here is what can be done now:

Strengthen disclosure requirements: Sebi could require companies to disclose more information on their ownership structures, related-party transactions and tax liabilities. Opaque practices designed to evade taxes vanish once they are exposed to light.

Improve monitoring of corporate actions: Sebi could enhance its monitoring of corporate deals, such as mergers and acquisitions, to ensure that they are in the best interests of shareholders and do not involve any conflicts of interest. Stricter or more enforceable rules on the appointment and removal of directors could also make a difference.

Tougher enforcement: Sebi could take a more active approach to enforcing its regulations by conducting regular audits and inspections of listed companies. It could also deploy harsher penalties for rule violators to deter business misconduct.

Enhance investor awareness and protection: India’s market regulator should educate investors better about their rights and responsibilities. They need protection from fraudulent practices that only regulators can provide. This programme could include stepped-up investor grievance mechanisms, mandatory investor education modules and strengthened whistleblower protections.

Better collaboration with other regulatory bodies: Sebi should work more closely with other regulatory bodies, such as the Reserve Bank of India and Union ministry of corporate affairs, to share information and coordinate efforts aimed at combating financial fraud and misconduct.

In general, Sebi should continue to strengthen its regulatory framework and pre-emptively enforce regulations to ensure that Indian markets for securities remains fair, transparent and trustworthy.

The Adani scandal exposed weaknesses in Indian corporate governance. It is essential that the issues raised are addressed for India to make the most of its economic potential. The country must attract investment, create jobs and build a sustainable economy.

By strengthening corporate governance, India can create a business environment conducive to long-term prosperity.

The Congress on Wednesday said a range of issues the party had raised with respect to Adani Group could only be addressed through a joint parliamentary committee probe (JPC) and not the ongoing Supreme Court-appointed committee, which may not be inclined to look at the entire gamut of questions.

“The SC-appointed expert committee lacks the jurisdiction to probe all aspects of the Adani issue and would only be a clean-chit panel for the government. Only a JPC can address all questions we have asked and we have until today asked 100 questions of the Prime Minister,” AICC general secretary communications Jairam Ramesh said.

At a press conference to mark 100 questions under the Congress’ ‘Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun’ series, Ramesh said the party would take the matter down to the people through its organisation and added that the SC “unfortunately did not have a formal jurisdiction over central probe agencies”. The Congress has been raising these questions starting February 5.

Ramesh said the government had never hesitated to deploy central probe agencies against the Opposition, civil society and independent businesses and said, “We conclude with the final question — will the PM act in national interest using the investigative agencies to probe the Adani deals?”","Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 22The Congress on Wednesday said a range of issues the party had raised with respect to Adani Group could only be addressed through a joint parliamentary committee probe (JPC) and not the ongoing Supreme Court-appointed committee, which may not be inclined to look at the entire gamut of questions.

On 27th Feb arguments resume after 1 year. 17th March judgement reserved.” He said that, “This is not a coincidence.”

9 days after @RahulGandhi's Adani speech in LS on Feb 7th, the defamation case against him gets fast tracked by the complainant withdrawing his own stay in the HC on 16th Feb.

On 27th Feb arguments resume after 1 year.

17th March judgement reserved. This is no coincidence. — Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) March 24, 2023

The Congress has alleged that there is causation, not merely correlation between the resumption of the hearings in Surat against Rahul Gandhi, after a curious suspension with the complainant seeking to delay proceedings. It is the defendant who usually does that.

The case was filed on April 16, 2019, and Rahul Gandhi appeared in the court of the then CJM, Surat, A.N. Dave on June 24, 2021, to record his statement in person. The case was filed by a Gujarat state cabinet minister and three-times MLA from Surat West, in March 2022, when the complainant’s request for Rahul Gandhi to be summoned again was rejected by the CJM who insisted arguments commence immediately, the complainant rushed to the high court and sought a stay on the trial’s proceedings. This was granted on March 7, 2022.

After a break of 11 months, the complainant went back to the high court on February 16, 2023, seeking vacation of the stay, pleading that “sufficient evidence has come on record of the trial court and the pendency of the present matter delays the trial”. Though no new evidence had come on record since the stay and the “pendency of the matter” was entirely at his own instance, the complainant was granted the relief he sought.

Complainant Purnesh Modi’s decision to restart a trial he had himself put on hold for a year came barely a week after Rahul Gandhi had launched a sharp attack on Narendra Modi in parliament over his links to controversial businessman Gautam Adani.

The Lok Sabha speech by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on February 7 seems to have set other things in motion too, far away from Surat, in parliament. Portions of Gandhi’s speech that hit out at the prime minister for allegedly facilitating the unencumbered growth of Adani Group were expunged from the parliamentary records at the behest of speaker Om Birla on February 8. 18 portions were knocked out.

It is hard to prove that there is a direct Adani connection to the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Lok Sabha, but the sequence of events raises enough questions about such a possibility. The government would be hard-pressed to deny such a linkage with any authority, considering how PM Modi has avoided a response to any mention of Adani.","The case was filed on April 16, 2019, and Rahul Gandhi appeared in the court of the then CJM, Surat, A.N.

Adani Power is shortlisted in short-term ASM framework Stage-I effective March 23, according to separate circulars available on the exchanges.

The parameters for shortlisting securities under ASM include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close-to-close price variation and price-earning ratio.

The NSE and BSE said Adani Power has satisfied the criteria for inclusion under short-term ASM.

Adani Power had come out of the short-term ASM framework on March 17, along with Adani Enterprises Ltd. and Adani Wilmar Ltd. stocks. These three stocks were added to the framework on March 9.

Currently, there is no Adani group stock in the short-term ASM framework.

Under the short-term ASM, the exchanges said, ""Applicable rate of margin shall be 50 per cent or existing margin whichever is higher, subject to maximum rate of margin capped at 100 per cent, w.e.f. March 24, 2023 on all open positions as on March 23, 2023 and new positions created from March 24, 2023.""

Meanwhile, stocks of eight Adani group companies out of the 10 listed entities closed in the green territory on Wednesday.

After taking a beating on the bourses, following the report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, the group stocks had recovered. However, amid sluggish broader market trends, the group's stocks have declined in the last few trading sessions. The report had made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against it.

The group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.","New Delhi: NSE and BSE will include Adani Power under the short-term additional surveillance measure (ASM) framework from today.

During a press meet on Saturday, Gandhi insisted that “there is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani” and asked, “There is a question, Rs 20,000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani’s shell companies, where has this money come from? Some of these companies are defence companies. Whose money is being spent on our drone and missile development? Why is the defence ministry not asking this question?”

Though he did not elaborate, Gandhi’s reference to the specific figure of Rs 20,000 crore resonates with two recent developments related to the group and data analysis on monies coming into the Adani Group.

“Over half” of Adani FDI came from “opaque overseas entities”: FT

An analysis by Financial Times this month, using publicly available financial data from India, concluded that almost half of Adani’s $5.7 billion foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows were from “opaque overseas entities with connections to group”.

The Financial Times, on analysing India’s FDI remittance data, reported that offshore companies “linked to the Adanis” and “bearing funds of unclear provenance” invested almost half of all the FDI that came into the Adani Group of companies. This could be said to amount to “Rs 20,000 crore”, the figure Gandhi mentioned in his press conference.

The London-based financial daily had also written in its report about the “the role of hard-to-scrutinise money flows in financing the Indian tycoon’s business empire”. It added that Adani had aligned himself “with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda”.

The report had also stated that these “offshore companies linked to the Adanis” invested at least $2.6 billion in the group between 2017 and 2022, which was 45.4% of the more than $5.7 billion it received in total FDI over the period.

The analysis concluded that the total amount of opaque overseas investments in Adani companies was an underestimation and the actual value will be higher since official FDI numbers in India exclude foreign portfolio investments, “which fall under a different reporting regime”, and also investments in listed companies amounting to less than 10% of their paid-up capital.

Aborted Adani FPO: Rs 20,000 crore

Adani Enterprises had raised Rs 20,000 crore (US$2.5 billion) through a fully subscribed follow-on public offer (FPO) in late January. However, as reported by The Wire, it subsequently called off the FPO as it faced market volatility in the wake of allegations that the parent company Adani Group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud.

The Adani Group had then said in a statement, “Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility, the company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction.”

Forbes magazine has also reported on what it said was “evidence the Adani Group likely bought into” the $2.5 billion share sale. The involvement of Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital – two entities that Hindenburg Research had alleged were linked to Adani – in the share sale “raises questions about whether any of Adani’s personal funds were deployed to help meet the $2.5 billion target”, the business magazine wrote.

“The only way Adani can actually resolve this issue is to illustrate who did buy all of the shares. It would be my speculation that there were insiders,” the report had quoted Tim Buckley, a former investment banker at Citigroup and director at Australia-based Climate Energy Finance, who has been studying the Adani Group for over a decade, as saying.

‘PM is scared of my next speech, which is going to come on Adani’

During the press meet, the Congress leader insisted that he has been targeted for raising uncomfortable questions about the saffron party’s relationship with the corporate house.

“Please understand why I have been disqualified. I have been disqualified because the Prime Minister is scared of my next speech. He is scared of the next speech that is going to come on Adani. I have seen it in his eyes. So, he is terrified of the next speech that is going to come and they don’t want that speech to be in Parliament. That is the issue, that is why first the distraction, now the disqualification,” he said.

Following Gandhi’s press conference, BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad addressed the media on the issue where he said: “We don’t have to defend Adani, BJP never defends Adani, but BJP doesn’t target anyone either.”

The BJP claimed that Gandhi has been disqualified in accordance with a Supreme Court ruling. Prasad spoke about the international business deals the Adani group engaged in during the Congress rule from 2004 to 2014 and also about its investments in Congress-ruled states.

During a press meet on Saturday, Gandhi insisted that “there is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani” and asked, “There is a question, Rs 20,000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani’s shell companies, where has this money come from?

Though he did not elaborate, Gandhi’s reference to the specific figure of Rs 20,000 crore resonates with two recent developments related to the group and data analysis on monies coming into the Adani Group.

“Over half” of Adani FDI came from “opaque overseas entities”: FT

An analysis by Financial Times this month, using publicly available financial data from India, concluded that almost half of Adani’s $5.7 billion foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows were from “opaque overseas entities with connections to group”.

The Financial Times, on analysing India’s FDI remittance data, reported that offshore companies “linked to the Adanis” and “bearing funds of unclear provenance” invested almost half of all the FDI that came into the Adani Group of companies. This could be said to amount to “Rs 20,000 crore”, the figure Gandhi mentioned in his press conference.

The London-based financial daily had also written in its report about the “the role of hard-to-scrutinise money flows in financing the Indian tycoon’s business empire”. It added that Adani had aligned himself “with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda”.

The report had also stated that these “offshore companies linked to the Adanis” invested at least $2.6 billion in the group between 2017 and 2022, which was 45.4% of the more than $5.7 billion it received in total FDI over the period.

The analysis concluded that the total amount of opaque overseas investments in Adani companies was an underestimation and the actual value will be higher since official FDI numbers in India exclude foreign portfolio investments, “which fall under a different reporting regime”, and also investments in listed companies amounting to less than 10% of their paid-up capital.

Aborted Adani FPO: Rs 20,000 crore

Adani Enterprises had raised Rs 20,000 crore (US$2.5 billion) through a fully subscribed follow-on public offer (FPO) in late January. However, as reported by The Wire, it subsequently called off the FPO as it faced market volatility in the wake of allegations that the parent company Adani Group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud.

The Adani Group had then said in a statement, “Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility, the company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction.”

Forbes magazine has also reported on what it said was “evidence the Adani Group likely bought into” the $2.5 billion share sale. The involvement of Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital – two entities that Hindenburg Research had alleged were linked to Adani – in the share sale “raises questions about whether any of Adani’s personal funds were deployed to help meet the $2.5 billion target”, the business magazine wrote.

The nationwide protest by Israelis against the plans to overhaul the judicial system led to a major impact.



Massive protests across Israel have cut the country off from the outside in several ways and threaten to paralyse the economy. Its several major ports, including Haifa Port, have ceased work. Adani Ports and SEZ own 70 per cent of the port.



Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone tumbled as much as 5 per cent on Tuesday, before recovering to Rs 602.30 at 10.20 am. The scrip had settled at Rs 629.10 on Monday. However, the company commanded a market cap of Rs 1.3 lakh crore.



Shares of Adani Ports have plunged as much as 30 per cent in the year 2023 so far, whereas it is trading 40 per cent below its 52-week high at 987.90 on September 20, 2022.



A consortium of India's Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) and Israel's Gadot Group won the tender in July last year to privatise the Port of Haifa for a staggering $1.18 billion. It completed the process of purchase on January 11 this year. Adani Ports owns 70 per cent, whereas Gadot Group owns 30 per cent.



The Port of Haifa is the second largest port in Israel in terms of shipping containers and the biggest in shipping tourist cruise ships. About 99 per cent of all goods move in and out of Israel by sea and port upgrades are needed to maintain economic growth.



According to the media reports, the agitating workers protested against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s judicial reforms. Protesters were reported to gather in Jerusalem, near the supreme court and Israel’s parliament Knesset.



Shares of Adani Group have been reeling under pressure for more than two months after the US-based short-seller Hindenburg alleged the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate of high debt levels and financial manipulation in the financial statements.

The move also comes after the two bourses put Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission from the second stage of the long-term ASM framework to Stage-I on Friday.

On March 17, the NSE and BSE had put Adani Green Energy and NDTV under the first stage of the long-term ASM framework. On the other hand, all the 10 listed firms of the Adani group on Monday ended the session in red. During the trading on the stock market, h Adani Power, Adani Transmission, Adani Wilmar and Adani Total Gas each fell nearly by 5 per cent on Monday.

Moreover, many of the group firms hit the lower circuit limits during intraday trading on Monday.

As per the parameters for shortlisting securities under ASM, publically listed company should have low variation, required client concentration, number of price band hits, close-to-close price variation and price-earning ration. The NSE and BSE, in their statement, said Adani Power satisfied the criteria for inclusion under short-term ASM.

Under the short-term ASM, the exchanges said, ""Applicable rate of margin shall be 50 per cent or existing margin whichever is higher, subject to maximum rate of margin capped at 100 per cent, w.e.f.

The bourses also highlighted that the shortlisting of securities under ASM is based on the account of market surveillance, and it should not be construed as an adverse action against the concerned company or entity.

The group stocks of Adani enterprises tumbled heavy after a report by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research was published in January this year. The reports had alleged Gautam Adani and his company of fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against it.

However, the Adani group has dismissed all the charges against it made by the short-seller, Hindneburg. The company also clarified of complying with all laws and disclosure requirements. Moreover, the issue has also become a major controversy in nation's political scenario.

The Himachal Pradesh government will launch a probe into the alleged irregularities in setting up of controlled atmosphere (CA) stores in the state’s apple belt and violation of the Agriculture Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act by the Adani Group, revenue minister Jagat Singh Negi said on Tuesday. (HT File)

Strict action will be taken if any wrongdoing is found, said Negi, who also holds the horticulture portfolio, while replying to a question asked by Theog MLA Kuldeep Singh Rathore in the assembly.

He said between 2008 and 2011, the National Horticulture Board provided subsidy of about ₹16 crore to Adani Group through NABARD for setting up CA stores in Himachal, but no MoU has been signed in this regard.

Negi said the government would find out whether it could legally ink the pact after so many years to protect the interests of the growers. The minister informed the House that Adani Group has set up CA stores at Sainj in Theog, Mehadali in Rohru and Revali in Kumarsain tehsil of Shimla district.

Earlier, raising the issue through a supplementary question, Rathore had said that CA stores were set up by Adani Group without signing an MoU. He claimed the Adani Group declares its rates in the middle of the season which results in crash in the market. Due to the sudden fall of prices, apple growers suffer huge losses, he added.

Shimla (Urban) MLA Harish Janartha said the procurement rates of apples should be fixed after consultation with the growers and there should be some mechanism to fix the rates.

In reply to another question asked by Dharamshala MLA Sudhir Sharma, the revenue minister said out of total 16,352 Pong Dam oustees, certificates have been issued to 15,352 people. He said that Kangra’s additional superintendent of police has been appointed as the nodal officer for redressal of complaints of illegal encroachments and other issues faced by Pong Dam oustees.

For timely redressal of the issues, the complaints have been forwarded to the Rajasthan Police, he said, adding that the stakeholders have been invited thrice for disbursement of eligibility certificates to the remaining oustees and submit their requisite documents for land allocation. “After verification, their cases can be sent to the Rajasthan government.”

In response to a question by MLA Sanjay Rattan, rural development and panchayati raj minister Anirudh Singh said the state government will reorganise the development blocks in Himachal before the panchayat elections to be held in the year 2025.

He said that reorganisation would be done after consultation with the MLAs. He said in the constituencies which still do not have block development offices, the government will consider opening these offices according to the need. He said the government would consider opening block development offices at Palampur, Jawalamukhi and Panchrukhi. He said some blocks were denotified because the previous government had carved out development blocks of only 15 to 20 panchayats.

In response to the question of MLA Ravi Thakur, deputy chief minister Mukesh Agnihotri, who also holds the transport portfolio, said there are 46 buses at Keylong depot which have completed their life and have to be replaced.

Equal number of buses is to be replaced in Reckong Peo depot, he said, adding that the state government or the corporation is currently not in a position to replace these buses at once and the HRTC instead would provide 10 new buses each to Keylong and Reckong Peo depots.

Replying to a question raised by MLA Puran Chand Thakur, Agnihotri said the government would submit the project for channelisation of Mandah Khad to the central government for funding. He also appealed to the Opposition for its cooperation to get the project approved.

He said presently, the entire focus of the central government is on the Jal Jeevan Mission and works such as drinking water, irrigation and flood control were not on its priority list.

Notification for strengthening institution of MLAs to be issued

Chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu on Tuesday said that a notification would be released and guidelines be framed by the committee to suggest steps for strengthening the institution of Vidhan Sabha and MLAs.

He was replying to the issue raised through point of order immediately after the question hour by Trilok Jamwal (BJP), who said so far, no committee has been constituted.

The chief minister had assured the house on March 24 said that a committee of senior MLAs would be constituted to prepare the report on strengthening the Vidhan Sabha secretariat and safeguarding the dignity of MLAs.

The assurance came after Bhawani Singh Pathania (Congress) raised the issue that his vehicle was challenged by judicial magistrate for displaying MLA flag on his vehicle, while the magistrate who challaned his vehicle was having nameplate on his vehicle which is not allowed under the Motor Vehicles Act.

Replying in the House, parliamentary affairs minister Harshwardhan Chauhan said a committee has been constituted in this regard and named two BJP MLAs – Vipin Parmar and Anil Sharma.

However, leader of Opposition Jai Ram Thakur said that there is no clarity on the committee and asked the names of the Congress MLAs included in the committee.

Is there more steam?","Adani's cement stocks on Tuesday recorded a steep selloff. Both Ambuja Cements and ACC stock have dipped by around 4% each. The slippery slope in Ambuja and ACC comes after the Gautam Adani-backed group released its blueprint for future goals in the cement business. The conglomerate plans to double capacity, focus on high growth states, ramp up demand, increase shares in various verticals, and diversify asset footprint were some of the few major goals.

Ambuja stock traded near its day low currently. At the time of writing, Ambuja Cements traded at ₹357 apiece down by ₹12.75 or 3.45% on BSE. The stock has shed at least 4.2% with an intraday low of ₹354.20 apiece earlier in the day. The company's market cap is over ₹71,036 crore as of now.

Meanwhile, ACC stock slipped by ₹73.65 or 4.4% to trade at ₹1,611.15 apiece on BSE. The stock touched a new 52-week low of ₹1,593.50 apiece earlier in the day.

Ambuja Cements is the largest stock of Adani in the cement space. While Adani holds a majority stake in ACC through Ambuja.

As of December 31, 2022, the Group holds s 63.15% stake in Ambuja Cement which in turn owns 50.05% in ACC Limited. Adani directly owns a 6.64% stake in ACC.

In the investors presentation that the group released on March 27, Adani announced that the group plans to double capacity to 140 MTPA from the current 67.5 MTPA going forward in the cement business (Ambuja and ACC). The group has set ₹7,000 crore capital expenditure for doubling capacity 140 MTPA including additional capacity unlocking through debottlenecking. Accordingly, Adani expects net sales to rise to ₹70,000 crore by FY28 fiscal compared to ₹29,700 crore so far in FY23.

Furthermore, Adani expects aims EBITDA per ton to rise to ₹1,470 by FY28 from the current ₹1,000. Also, EBITDA margins are trajected to expand from 19% to 25% in FY28.

Also, the group plans a well-diversified asset footprint to cater pan-India cement demand (incl. captive coal mine – Gare Palma/Dahegaon Gowari). Further, Adani aims to achieve the lowest cost to serve by leveraging Group’s vast experience and unmatched adjacencies in all critical areas such as group infrastructure and digital platform, energy cost, and supply chain.

On the overall industry level, Adani expects strong volume growth on the back of projected GDP growth and proposed infra spend in the budget. Further, the group believes that cement per capita consumption offers good headroom for growth (global average of 525 kg per person vs 250 kg in India).

Adani expects the demand-capacity gap to remain narrow (demand growth of ~7% and capacity growth of ~6% over FY23-FY28) for the industry. While capacity utilization is seen in the range of 70% -75%. Also, it expects price realisations to remain healthy.

According to Emkay Global, the Adani Group filed an investor presentation with the stock exchanges, unveiling its roadmap for capacity expansion and cost efficiencies. Management: i) re-iterated its guidance of doubling capacity to 140mt by FY28 (16% CAGR), at a CAPEX of Rs460 billion (USD77/ton) to be funded via internal accruals; ii) stated its target of achieving consolidated EBITDA of Rs175 billion, with EBITDA/ton of Rs1,470 by FY28; iii) aims for Rs300-400/ton EBITDA improvement in FY24, through operational efficiencies. The Group has also outlined a few projects totaling 24mt cement capacity expansion (vs 11mt announced earlier), aimed to be commissioned in the next 2-3 years.

Also, the brokerage outlined that the Group is also looking at various sales & marketing initiatives, like i) focus on nine high-growth states (for cement): Rajasthan, Punjab, HP, UP, J&K, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, and Karnataka; ii) leveraging group adjacencies to drive premium-quality green cement volumes; iii) focus on special application premium cement (22% of trade sales); iv) increase in the share of B2B segment; v) increase in productivity of the technical services team to convert IHB leads; and vi) emphasis on digitization initiatives.

In its research note, Emkay said, ""We are awaiting clarity on clinker capacity expansion, equipment ordering, and conversion of warrants.""

In regards to Adani's cement stocks, Emkay's note concluded, ""we have a HOLD rating on Ambuja Cements, with target price of Rs425/share, based on 15x FY25E EV/E.""

A Government official said: “Airlines have written to the AERA to not implement any increase in the aeronautical tariff in the Third Control Period and defer any increase in the same to the next control period because it will impact the airlines adversely.”

While the parking and landing charges are paid by the airlines, the UDF is a fee levied on the passenger’s ticket to utilise the facilities at the airport.

In the past one year, tariffs at Ahmedabad and Mangalore airports have been increased.

“The proposed tariffs at Lucknow airport are exorbitant. This kills all airlines equally. Airlines are already grappling with losses, and they are still making up for the past three years of covid, higher ATF costs and now the inflation. This will make it difficult for airlines to sustain the cash flow. The only option then is to pass it on to the customers making airfares extremely higher at the airport,” said an airline official.

The proposed landing, parking and user development charges are decided according to domestic and international segments and according to the size of the aircraft.

An official said: “As compared to the narrow body aircraft (B-737/A320), the increase proposed for the smaller aircraft is almost double that of the increase proposed in the narrow body aircraft.”

Major impact seen

He explained that this will have a major impact on the regional connectivity scheme (RCS), “The RCS was implemented to increase connectivity to comparatively smaller regional airports like Lucknow and also to far flung airports, especially by smaller aircraft,” he said.

“Even if it is not a regional route, the charges are eventually passed on to the passengers to an extent making air travel extremely expensive for the customer. And the user development fees too have been proposed to be hiked by approximately 480 per cent,” an official source said.

He said based on the metric tonne of a Q-400, which is 30 metric tonnes, the proposed approximate increase is 158-184 per cent from existing charges. On the other hand, for a large aircraft like Boeing 737-800, the approximate proposed increase is between 108 per cent and 130 per cent from existing charges.

Similarly, for landing charges for the International on Q-400 approximate increase would be between 248 per cent and 283 per cent from existing charges; and on B-737-800 approximately increase between 127 per cent and 150 per cent.

Parking charges

On the parking charges too, on the domestic front, Lucknow International Airport Limited has proposed to increase the tariffs, which would impact the tariffs for an aircraft such as Q-400 by approximately between 418 per cent and 471 per cent from existing charges.

An airline official requesting anonymity said, for landing and parking charges, LIAL has proposed to reduce the number of tariff slabs, which is contrary to airline interests.","Indian airlines have raised objections over the proposed landing and parking charges increase at Adani-owned Lucknow airport, said sources at Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA).

Moitra has been one of the main voices in the Opposition who has been demanding a JPC probe into the Adani row since the Hindenburg Research's report alleged stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens by the group. The Adani Group has denied the allegations.

“Adani shares tumble on @reuters report that group seeking time to pay ACC, Ambuja debt. Don’t have cash flows, don’t have credibility to access long term bond markets. All chickens coming home to roost!” Moitra said in her latest tweet.

Reuters report added that the group's flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, slid nearly 8% to a near four-week low, while Adani Ports tumbled 9.2%. ACC dropped 4.8% to its lowest since February 2021 and Ambuja Cement slipped 4.2%.

The group, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, has begun negotiations with lenders to extend the tenure of its $3 billion bridge loan to a period of five years or beyond from the existing 18 months, The Economic Times said on Tuesday, citing sources.

Adani refutes reports on debt repayment concerns

The Adani Group refuted the reports in separate statements on Tuesday, calling the claims “baseless speculation.” Later in the day, the company addressed The Ken report, saying it had paid off share-backed financing amounting to $2.15 billion and that the stock pledged for those facilities had been released.

Adani spokesman Jugeshinder Singh earlier tweeted that the report was a “deliberate misrepresentation.”

However, if one adjusts for the investments of GQG in Adani Group, the net flow is still negative, meaning FPIs have withdrawn money even in March, Sanchit Garg, Co-founder & CEO, GLC Wealth Advisor LLP, said.

After pulling out funds in the past two months, Foreign investors have invested Rs 7,936 crore in the Indian equities in March mainly driven by bulk investment in the Adani Group companies by the US-based GQG Partners.

According to V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, the sustained selling by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) appears to be over, since they have turned buyers in the last few days.

""The near-term outlook for FPI looks much more positive now. Even though Indian valuation continues to be relatively high, the recent market correction has made valuations a bit more reasonable than earlier,"" Vijayakumar said.

Moreover, going ahead, FPIs may not turn aggressive sellers due to domestic factors like an impressive turnaround in current account deficit (CAD), which has improved substantially due to rising exports.

The CAD which was 4.4 per cent in Q2FY23 has turned into surplus in Q3 FY23. Therefore, the Indian Rupee is likely to be stable, going forward, he added.

According to the data with depositories, FPIs have pumped in a net sum of Rs 7,396 crore in Indian equities in March.

This came after a net outflow of Rs 5,294 crore in February and Rs 28,852 crore in January. Prior to that, FPIs infused a net amount of Rs 11,119 crore in December, data showed.

In terms of sectors, FPIs have been consistent buyers in capital goods and alternating between buying and selling in the financial services space.

On the other hand, FPIs have pulled out Rs 2,505 crore from the debt market during the period under review. This was pursuant to their investment of Rs 3,531 crore in January and Rs 2,436 crore in February.

Going forward, the outlook is mixed as interventions by governments and central banks globally have stabilized markets, which should have some positive impact on FPIs flows in the near-term, Manish Jeloka, Co-head of Products & Solutions, Sanctum Wealth, said.

However, this will lead to renewed concerns on inflation down the line, which may lead to outflows at some point over the next few months.

GLC Wealth Advisor LLP's Garg believes that India is better placed compared to other nations and the long-term growth story still stays intact.

Also, India and Indonesia witnessed inflows during the month under review, while Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand saw a net withdrawal.","After pulling out funds in the past two months, Foreign investors have invested Rs 7,936 crore in the Indian equities in March mainly driven by bulk investment in the Adani Group companies by the US-based GQG Partners.

I think there is a lag. So my guess is that next one or two quarters will be quite tough for IT companies. Now good news and good prices all of us know do not come together so at some point of time within these quarters we will get into buy zone for IT companies but at this point of time I would still like to focus on domestic focus companies.For some it will be, for others it will not be and in many of these cases like the signings yesterday these orders were already announced earlier and it is just that first an order is announced and then it is actually signed and then gets implemented so I think so we should not be doing double counting in some of these orders.But that said overall it is a low volatility sort of sector in terms of performance but these are long gestation projects so for example many of the ship orders or frigate missile launch orders which were announced yesterday the delivery starts in 2026-27 etc and then goes on for a few years so it is not that everything is going to come now. These are very long gestation projects and as such the revenue is spread out.The impact of Adani Group on the overall market should be limited because the base case was always that they are unlikely to default and if they are unlikely to default then for the rest of the market the contagion should be limited. Now how the overall Adani Group will perform is something we need to see because stocks have fallen from the top but they are still not cheap because the rise was so abnormal that people think that because they are half the valuation they are cheap. Most of them are still not cheap. So I think they will need to go through a long phase of consolidation.I would think all of them are good to buy now. I would say risk reward is at worst case another 10% downside and potential upside of 25% over the next one year or so. So I think risk reward is favourable. These banks are well placed, balance sheets are strong, profit growth will be reasonable.That I cannot predict because I do not know what numbers will come out. But I think many of the auto stocks got beaten down after the monsoon prediction that monsoons will be bad, summers will be very hot and that might impact overall sentiment, rural income, inflation, dynamics, interest rates etc.So I think that is where the correction in many of these companies which are actually doing well started. Now we have not had a hot summer till now and monsoon is still a question mark how that will be. So I think those externalities are difficult to predict but valuation wise I think these companies have become more reasonable now and although consumer demand might be slow to recover but I think it will eventually recover and going into later part of this year we should see stronger growth. So four wheelers, autos I would still like to see and two wheelers I would still like to avoid.I do not buy many of these banks but that does not mean that they cannot rise up further. If the overall banking sector moves up, then they might also move up but challenges are more on the operational side because this year we would have seen the best of the reduced write-offs, increase in margins, etc. All of that will not go through from next year onwards. So, I think the results and everything are not going to be as great as what people think it would be.Because of the fact that the credit, one, the credit growth has been strong, it will moderate a bit but I think on the deposit side, many of these PSU Banks, the costing will go up substantially because they are losing market share in low-cost deposits and once the easy liquidity chase got over, I think that will be the challenge. So, I think the impact of that we will need to see.","So my guess is that next one or two quarters will be quite tough for IT companies.

Both ACC and Ambuja Cements, acquired last year by Gautam Adani, have their headquarters in Mumbai. However, with the acquisition by the Adani Group, the focal point is shifting to Gujarat and so are some of the key roles in the company. For instance, Ajay Kapur, Chief Executive Officer of the Cement Business of Adani Group, operates out of Ahmedabad, while other leadership roles, including the heads of divisions such as procurement, supply chain, health and safety have also been shifted out of Mumbai.

People reporting to such divisional chiefs either spend a substantial time outside Mumbai and Maharashtra or shuttle back and forth Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Sources said this situation is creating a strained atmosphere with a large number of people preferring to look for other options. Women having family responsibilities and those who are not willing to relocate have little option but to look for alternative employment opportunities.

Those who have not relocated are compelled to travel because their bosses are no longer sitting in Mumbai, said sources. There is a similar situation in some of the other locations, sources added.

The sources further said that competing firms in the industry, based in Mumbai, have been receiving calls for job vacancies as have companies belonging to other conglomerates in the city.

In response to queries sent by businessline, a spokesperson for the Adani group replied, “We do not comment on our employee related matters.”

Besides the issues related to relocation, there is a disquiet among employees due to the uncertainty triggered by corporate governance issues surrounding the group and intense scrutiny by stakeholders. There is also fear of job cuts as the group grapples with the huge debt on its balance sheet and is looking for ways to reduce and optimise costs.

The news filtering in from Ahmedabad, the seat of the Adani empire, has given rise to some uneasiness as sources said that the group is making no attempt to hold on to people who want to leave.

The two companies between them have an employee base of over 10,000 and Mumbai, being the headquarters, has a significant number of them. At the end of FY22, ACC had over 6,000 permanent employees on its rolls of which the management staff is about 60 percent, while the remaining staff were shop floor workers, deployed at its various plants and sites. Ambuja Cements has 4,700-odd employees with roughly 70 percent of them in the management cadre.","Employees of ACC and Ambuja Cements are out in the market looking for jobs with the new owner, the Adani Group, relocating significant roles to Ahmedabad, sources said.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar. (ANI)

Besides NCP, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has also supported a court-monitored probe on the Adani issue.

Pawar said a probe by JPC may prove to be futile as the panel may comprise more members from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which enjoys a majority in Parliament. “In view of the present strength of BJP in Parliament, it would be more rational to accept the SC panel to probe the Adani issue,” Pawar said.

State Congress chief spokesperson Atul Londhe, however, insisted for a JPC probe. “Why is the ruling BJP scared of forming a JPC ?” he said.

American securities research firm Hindenburg Research has accused the Adani Group of fraud and stock manipulation. The conglomerate has denied the charges.

Last month, the Supreme Court ordered a probe into the matter and set up an experts committee to be headed by its retired judge AM Sapre. It also sought a status report from markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on its ongoing investigation within two months.

Several opposition parties, led by the Congress, have been seeking a JPC probe into the report. Both the first half of the Budget session and the ongoing second half have witnessed bitter exchanges between the government and the Opposition over repeated disruptions on the matter.

The TMC, however, said it supports a court-monitored probe in the matter. “We have nothing to do with the demand of other parties for a JPC probe on the Adani issue. We want a court-monitored probe,” TMC’s parliamentary leader Derek O’Brien said last month.

While the Opposition persisted with its demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the Adani issue, the treasury benches pressed for an apology from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for ‘democracy under attack’ remarks made in the UK.

Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar declined a point of order raised by Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge on March 13 in which he objected to a call by the BJP for Gandhi to come to the Upper House and apologise for insulting the Parliament, drawing more protests from the Congress.

Leader of House Piyush Goyal, without naming Gandhi, had demanded an apology for “the shameless way by which a senior leader of the opposition in a foreign country has attacked the democracy of India, insulted the Parliament of India”.

Reading out his decision in the midst of slogan shouting by opposition members during the post-lunch session, the Chairman said, “Constitutional ‘privilege’ of ‘freedom of expression’ and ‘immunity’ from any civil or criminal action to Members of Parliament, calls for a high degree of care, caution and accountability.” This unique freedom privilege comes with heavy obligations. Breach of this privilege by engaging in reckless trading of allegations or free fall of information, invectives and innuendos or setting afoot pernicious narratives entail serious consequences, he added.

“The sanctity of the temple of democracy cannot be permitted to be outraged as the privilege does not extend to engaging in demeaning parliament, making disparaging observations tarnishing constitutional institutions or set afloat narratives premised on reckless allegations of untenable fact premise,” Dhankhar said.

After due consideration on the matter, he said,”…I am of the firm view that there can be no issue or individual beyond the purview of discussion in the Rajya Sabha and the same is exclusively subject to regulation by the House and the Chairman.” He said the two precedents relied upon by Kharge “have no bearing on the issue being determined herein”.

Kharge had cited a ruling given by late V V Giri on June 19, 1967 that “a member of one House should not use the freedom of speech on the floor of the House to make allegations or charge against the members of the other House”.

The other one was made on March 17, 1983 by the then Vice-Chairman in favour of L K Advani that stated: “Before referring to a member of the other House, one has to exercise a lot of care and caution…”.

Dhankhar said the authenticated record made available by Goyal, “bears out that his demand of apology on the overseas statements made by a senior leader of the opposition is factually premised and does not graduate to making ‘allegation of a defamatory or incriminatory nature’.” “In view of categorical and firm constitutional prescriptions, I cannot persuade myself to sustain the point of order raised by the Hon’ble Leader of the Opposition Shri Mallikarjun Kharge and the same is hereby declined,” the Chairman said.

In response, the Opposition members intensified their sloganeering following which Dhankhar adjourned the House for the day.

Earlier, when the Upper House reassembled at 2 pm after the first adjournment, Reports of the Public Accounts Committee (2022-23) were laid on the table by Bhubaneswar Kalita (BJP) amid sloganeering by opposition members who have been demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into allegations against the Adani Group.

Afterward, Dhankhar informed the House that he would give his decision on the point of order raised by Kharge last month even as the Congress leader demanded that he be given a chance to speak.

The Chairman indicated that he would give his decision on the point of order raised by Kharge and give the floor to the Leader of Opposition but the opposition members continued their sloganeering.

However, under the insistence of the opposition members, the Chairman gave the floor to Kharge, drawing protest from the treasury bench.

Kharge said he has been making efforts since morning under rule 267 to raise a few issues in the House but in vain and reiterated that a JPC probe must be conducted on the Adani issue.

Goyal, however, intervened and alleged that the Leader of the Opposition was trying to establish an unfounded matter which is not related to the Upper House and Kharge had no interest in the Chairman’s decision on his point of order.

“The real situation is this that they have defamed all the institutions of the country, the House and the Chair and he (Kharge) has also to apologise and his leader who also defamed all the institutions of the country both at home and abroad, be it judiciary, the House or the Election Commission (must apologise),” Goyal asserted.

He condemned the “pressure tactics” of the Congress and said the Leader of Opposition should stop “insulting” the House.

Kharge retorted saying he raised all the issues under established rules but the government is not allowing the Opposition to speak.

Earlier in the day, minutes after the House convened for the day it was adjourned till 2 pm as opposition MPs raised slogans demanding a JPC probe into fraud allegations against the Adani Group.

As the House met for the day, Kharge stood up to speak and was supported by MPs of other opposition parties.

However, Dhankhar asked them to wait till the listed papers were laid on the table of the House.

As the papers were tabled, the sloganeering by several opposition MPs continued.

The sloganeering intensified as the chairman said he had received a notice from Kharge under Rule 267 of Rajya Sabha for suspension of the scheduled business of the day.

As Dhankhar was reading the notice, AAP’s Sanjay Singh entered the Well of the House while raising slogans. Some Congress MPs joined him.

Several Congress MPs were dressed in black as a mark of protest against the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Lok Sabha.

Dhankhar warned Singh that he would be named.

Amid the din, the Chairman then adjourned the proceedings till 2 pm.

According to the business daily, the presentation covered disclosures on related party transactions by both listed and privately held Adani Group companies. It also covered other issues such as the group’s offshore companies, foreign portfolio investor holdings, and minimum stock market floats, the newspaper reported.

Apart from the top court panel, a SEBI team is also investigating the Adani Group for any lapses relating to the securities market as well as the market activity before and after Hindenburg Research published its report on January 24.

The newspaper added it will provide the required assistance to the court-appointed committee.

The SEBI team is also expected to conclude its investigation and submit its findings, in a sealed cover, to the committee within two months.

The apex court panel is headed by former Supreme Court judge A.M. Sapre, and comprises former bankers K.V. Kamath and O.P. Bhatt, Infosys cofounder Nandan Nilekani, securities lawyer Somasekhar Sundaresan and retired high court judge J.P. Devadhar.

Additionally, Buch also briefed the top court panel on SEBI’s policy for regulated short-selling and on policies followed in major international jurisdictions, the report added.

The SEBI chief also mentioned to the panel about the regulator’s existing investor protection mechanisms and what could be done to further strengthen them.

The allegations

Reuters reported over the weekend that SEBI is investigating a possible violation of ‘related party’ transaction rules in the Adani Group’s dealings with at least three offshore entities. These entities have links to the brother of the conglomerate’s founder, Vinod Adani, people aware of the matter told the news agency.

Earlier, the group had declared, as per CNBCTV18, that “the Adani Group and Vinod Adani should be seen as one“.

The Wire analysed how this might have a bearing on the free-float status of some companies in the Adani Group.

Publicly traded companies are required to have at least 25% of their shares held by non-promoters – be it retail investors, mutual funds, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), and insurance companies – to stay listed on exchanges.

Data from Trendlyne shows in the case of Adani Group, a few offshore investment funds (or FPIs) hold most of the free float.

An analysis by The Wire said if the offshore funds are to be accounted for having links to the Adani family, then the free float would slip to just under 25%, or even less than that.

The Morning Context wrote an investigative piece on Adani’s offshore firms and said, “if you remove these [offshore] funds, the effective [public] shareholding in Adani Enterprises comes down to only 10%.” In Adani Transmission, the “effective public float is about 7-8%”.

However, the ownership of these funds is unknown because Mauritius is a tax haven. And this concern was raised by SEBI in July 2021. It had asked the custodians of the FPIs who own shares in Adani’s listed firms to disclose the ‘ultimate beneficiary’.

A year later, in September 2022, Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee had written about these “silent soldiers”, or “Adani’s fortune drivers”, and that “they deserve some scrutiny”.

Interestingly, in this piece, observe how the rest of the FPIs, whose details are not available online, keeps on increasing year on year.","According to the business daily, the presentation covered disclosures on related party transactions by both listed and privately held Adani Group companies.

Addressing a gathering here at the diamond jubilee celebrations of the CBI, Modi said corruption was the biggest roadblock before democracy and justice and that the investigative agency’s key responsibility was to free India from it.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday played up corruption as the biggest problem before the country and linked it to “parivarvaad” (dynastic rule) but spoke not a word on the charges against the Adani group and his proximity to Gautam Adani.

His statement comes amid Opposition allegations that the government is misusing its investigative agencies, especially the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, to harass, intimidate and discredit political opponents.

At Monday’s event, the Prime Minister hit out at the Opposition saying “bhai-bhatijavaad” (nepotism) and “parivarvaad” thrived in an environment of corruption and this ultimately hindered the nation’s growth.

He said there was no dearth of political will today to act against corruption, and officers should act against the corrupt, however powerful, without hesitation.

Modi said that those who had benefited from corruption for decades had created an ecosystem that attacked the investigative agencies, but the agencies should not be deterred.

“These people will keep distracting you, but you have to focus on your work. No corrupt person should be spared and there should be no laxity in your efforts,” he said.

“This is the wish of the people of the country. The country, law and the Constitution are with you.”

Modi said India had been handed a legacy of corruption at the time of Independence and regretted that instead of abandoning it, some people kept nourishing it.

He described corruption as the biggest enemy of merit, saying it encouraged nepotism and dynastic rule, sapping the country’s strength and eventually stunting its development.

Modi said that while references to “trillion dollars” these days came in the context of a strong economy, such figures were used to describe scams in the country when the CBI celebrated its golden jubilee a decade ago.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday played up corruption as the biggest problem before the country and linked it to “parivarvaad” (dynastic rule) but spoke not a word on the charges against the Adani group and his proximity to Gautam Adani.

Telangana Congress president A. Revanth Reddy has claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was infuriated over the Adani Group’s worth falling by ₹ 11 lakh crore following Rahul Gandhi’s speech in Parliament, and that was the major reason for his disqualification from the Parliament.

“Why are the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi worried over Adani Group losing money due to its fraudulent business practices if they don’t have an association that the entire country acknowledges,” he asked. “Such is the rage of BJP against Mr. Gandhi that he was asked to vacate his official residence as well and this is just to have some vicarious pleasure,” he said at a press conference here.

Mr. Reddy announced that as a part of the party’s agitation against the unethical disqualification of Rahul Gandhi, a post-card campaign would be launched on Monday with lakhs of cadres writing to the Prime Minister seeking a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Adani issue. He said the party would organise a satyagraha on April 8 at Mancherial under the leadership of CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka.

Mr. Reddy said a “Nirudyoga Nirasana Sabha” (Unemployed protest meeting) would be held at Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s constituency Gajwel before April 25 to ensure that those involved in the TSPSC paper leak don’t go scot-free and for seeking accountability from the government. He demanded that the present TSPSC be dissolved immediately as it has lost people’s faith due to the leakage.

The present TSPSC team should not be entrusted with the responsibility of conducting the recruitment exams and a new team should be appointed to give confidence to the people. He said Congress would continue to press for the resignation of IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao in this case. Mr. Reddy said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a case on the TSPSC leak and this was due to the constant pressure put up by the party and the evidence it has put in the public domain.

Corruption charges against Aman Kumar Singh

In February 2020, an FIR was registered against Aman Kumar Singh and his wife Yasmeen Singh in an alleged disproportionate assets case by the Chhattisgarh's Economic Offences Wing (EOW).

Later, the FIR was quashed by the High Court, but reversed by the apex court last month.

On Saturday, Gandhi posted a tweet in which he suggested the Assam CM had some links with Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani. Responding to it, Sarma replied that he will meet Gandhi “in the court of law.”

“They hide the truth, that’s why they mislead everyday! The question remains the same - who has ₹20,000 crore benami money in Adani’s companies?” Gandhi wrote on Twitter in Hindi and attached an image with ‘Adani’ written as an acronym of sorts with letters of the names of the leaders. Sarma’s name is also featured in the image.

Sarma said that he doesn’t want to discuss the issue at the moment as the state is gearing up to celebrate Bohag Bihu and steps will be taken after April 14—the first day of the Assamese New Year.

The Assam CM further hit out at Delhi chief minister and said he is still waiting for an invitation from Arvind Kejriwal to ‘demystify’ how the Delhi government can provide 1.2 million jobs when the sanctioned strength of government staff for the national capital is only around 150,000.

Addressing a rally in Guwahati on April 2, the Delhi CM had claimed that the Aam Admi Party government had given jobs to 1.2 million people in the past 7-8 years.

Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, TMC chief whip...",None,"Sharad Pawar's response on Adani issue stirs opposition pot, triggers whispers in Congress on electoral resonance","NCP chief Sharad Pawar 's rejoinder to the Congress demand for a JPC on the Adani issue, not only advertised the differences NCP has with ally Congress, it also coincided with differences within the Opposition ranks, including scepticism within the Congress, on whether the issue on which Rahul Gandhi (and, therefore, the Congress leadership's) has chosen to focus fully has political/electoral resonance with the masses or whether the Adani matter -- despite vital issues raised by the Hindenburg report -- risks the same fate as Gandhi's pre-2019 LS poll fixation with the Rafale deal that had failed to fire up voters' imagination and helped the regime to divert electoral focus away from many incumbency issues.Pawar's stand against the JPC and his pitch for the Opposition focusing on bread and butter issues of the people to counter the Modi regime has the potential to tap the sentiments of some Opposition parties when the Congress leadership is preparing to host them for united moves. Many have noticed Pawar's stand against JPC has brought him on the same page with TMC supremo and his long-term ally Mamata Banerjee . The TMC MPs had distanced themselves from the Congress-led agitation in Parliament for a JPC on the Adani-Hindenburg issue.Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, TMC chief whip in the RS and national spokesperson, told ET: ""Mr Sharad Pawar, a very experienced and senior leader, has expressed his views on the Adani issue. The TMC has always been for a Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the Adani-Hindenburg matter. The fact that the SC has constituted a committee of experts to probe the Hindenburg revelations and also suggest ways to prevent recurrence of such issues, showed the apex court found prima facie merit in the demand for a probe. As everybody has faith in the Supreme Court, there can't be any grounds to doubt the SC-monitored probe. We would like to see an early completion of the probe and submission of the findings"".On his party not preferring a JPC on the matter, Ray said: ""There is nothing wrong per say in demanding a JPC probe but the fact is past JPC probes into Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh (stocks scams) and the 2G issues failed to produce anything concrete. That is why the TMC demanded a SC-monitored probe and didn't join the Congress' and others' agitation for a JPC. Rahul Gandhi had every right as an MP to speak in the House on the Adani issue but the treasury benches did the most unacceptable act of taking the lead in disrupting the entire session so that the Houses could not discuss the budget and many issues that concerned the people"".Sharad Pawar's stand on the Adani issue also came close on the heels of his earlier intervention to caution Rahul Gandhi about his comments on Savarkar that had angered Shiv Sena (UBT). The Sena has now showed understanding of Pawar's stand: ""Right from the beginning, Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjee's party were not for the JPC probe into the Adani issue. As an experienced administrator, Pawar sahab always has a liberal view on industrialists, and we understand that. For the Shiv Sena, Adani issue is important. Rahul Ji played a big role in taking it to the people. For Shiv Sena, equally important are issues such as unemployment, inflation and Centre's witch-hunt against Opposition leaders"".Whether all those 16 Opposition parties who protested along with the Congress in Parliament on Adani issue and for the JPC issues will stay the course is now a matter of suspense.Within the Congress, some leaders privately feel their leadership should, alongside the Adani issue, tactically broad-base the campaign against the Modi regime by showcasing economic issues that have hit ordinary people. They see in PM Modi's daily harping against ""corruption"", him erecting a counter to the Adani issue and against Opposition leaders, as his fourth plank alongside the 'leadership-development-Hindutva-nationalist' quartet.""The main reasons why Rahul ji's campaign against the Rafale deal and his ""Chowkidar chor hai' slogan didn't work in the election is because it was more about procedural issues than evidence of kick-back. Also, PM Modi's popularity rating was too high to be breached with the Rafael plank. Now, the Adani matter raises serious issues of crony capitalism and regulators' functioning, but whether the issue has a direct connect with the masses who vote and whether it alone can be effective in denting the PM's standing and his own positioning as a crusader against corruption is a matter of debate many among us,"" a senior Congress MP said privately.","Many have noticed Pawar's stand against JPC has brought him on the same page with TMC supremo and his long-term ally Mamata Banerjee .

Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, TMC chief whip...",None,"Sharad Pawar's response on Adani issue stirs opposition pot, triggers whispers in Congress on electoral resonance","NCP chief Sharad Pawar 's rejoinder to the Congress demand for a JPC on the Adani issue, not only advertised the differences NCP has with ally Congress, it also coincided with differences within the Opposition ranks, including scepticism within the Congress, on whether the issue on which Rahul Gandhi (and, therefore, the Congress leadership's) has chosen to focus fully has political/electoral resonance with the masses or whether the Adani matter -- despite vital issues raised by the Hindenburg report -- risks the same fate as Gandhi's pre-2019 LS poll fixation with the Rafale deal that had failed to fire up voters' imagination and helped the regime to divert electoral focus away from many incumbency issues.Pawar's stand against the JPC and his pitch for the Opposition focusing on bread and butter issues of the people to counter the Modi regime has the potential to tap the sentiments of some Opposition parties when the Congress leadership is preparing to host them for united moves. Many have noticed Pawar's stand against JPC has brought him on the same page with TMC supremo and his long-term ally Mamata Banerjee . The TMC MPs had distanced themselves from the Congress-led agitation in Parliament for a JPC on the Adani-Hindenburg issue.Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, TMC chief whip in the RS and national spokesperson, told ET: ""Mr Sharad Pawar, a very experienced and senior leader, has expressed his views on the Adani issue. The TMC has always been for a Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the Adani-Hindenburg matter. The fact that the SC has constituted a committee of experts to probe the Hindenburg revelations and also suggest ways to prevent recurrence of such issues, showed the apex court found prima facie merit in the demand for a probe. As everybody has faith in the Supreme Court, there can't be any grounds to doubt the SC-monitored probe. We would like to see an early completion of the probe and submission of the findings"".On his party not preferring a JPC on the matter, Ray said: ""There is nothing wrong per say in demanding a JPC probe but the fact is past JPC probes into Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh (stocks scams) and the 2G issues failed to produce anything concrete. That is why the TMC demanded a SC-monitored probe and didn't join the Congress' and others' agitation for a JPC. Rahul Gandhi had every right as an MP to speak in the House on the Adani issue but the treasury benches did the most unacceptable act of taking the lead in disrupting the entire session so that the Houses could not discuss the budget and many issues that concerned the people"".Sharad Pawar's stand on the Adani issue also came close on the heels of his earlier intervention to caution Rahul Gandhi about his comments on Savarkar that had angered Shiv Sena (UBT). The Sena has now showed understanding of Pawar's stand: ""Right from the beginning, Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjee's party were not for the JPC probe into the Adani issue. As an experienced administrator, Pawar sahab always has a liberal view on industrialists, and we understand that. For the Shiv Sena, Adani issue is important. Rahul Ji played a big role in taking it to the people. For Shiv Sena, equally important are issues such as unemployment, inflation and Centre's witch-hunt against Opposition leaders"".Whether all those 16 Opposition parties who protested along with the Congress in Parliament on Adani issue and for the JPC issues will stay the course is now a matter of suspense.Within the Congress, some leaders privately feel their leadership should, alongside the Adani issue, tactically broad-base the campaign against the Modi regime by showcasing economic issues that have hit ordinary people. They see in PM Modi's daily harping against ""corruption"", him erecting a counter to the Adani issue and against Opposition leaders, as his fourth plank alongside the 'leadership-development-Hindutva-nationalist' quartet.""The main reasons why Rahul ji's campaign against the Rafale deal and his ""Chowkidar chor hai' slogan didn't work in the election is because it was more about procedural issues than evidence of kick-back. Also, PM Modi's popularity rating was too high to be breached with the Rafael plank. Now, the Adani matter raises serious issues of crony capitalism and regulators' functioning, but whether the issue has a direct connect with the masses who vote and whether it alone can be effective in denting the PM's standing and his own positioning as a crusader against corruption is a matter of debate many among us,"" a senior Congress MP said privately.","Many have noticed Pawar's stand against JPC has brought him on the same page with TMC supremo and his long-term ally Mamata Banerjee .

Sharad Pawar's statement on Adani in an interview with the NDTV has created speculations over opposition unity as Sharad Pawar expressed his opinion against a joint parliamentary committee probe into the alleged Adani scam -- the main issue the Congress raised in the last Parliament session.

Pawar clarified that in a JPC, the ruling party has the majority and so a Supreme Court-appointed committee would be better than a JPC. But he reiterated that there are more important issues for the opposition to concentrate like unemployment, inflation and the agrarian crisis.

Congress and Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party have been allies for decades. In Maharashtra, they formed Maha Vikas Aghadi with Shiv Sena and came to power in 2019.

While the Congress maintained that notwithstanding Sharad Pawar's persion view on Adani, NCP supported the demand for the JPC, Sharad Pawar on Sunday differed with the opposition and said he does not think PM Modi's degree is an issue.

Jammu, April 8

Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he had failed politically, and claimed the Adani issue was being deliberately raked up to brighten his political career. He also accused the Congress of undermining the judiciary and said if it tried to “tear apart” the Constitution by attacking the judiciary, “we will not stay silent”. “I am not going to make any comment on it (Hindenburg-Adani issue) as the Supreme Court has already formed a committee and is looking into it,” Rijiju told reporters on the sidelines of a function at the University of Jammu here.

He said it is “deliberately” being made into an issue. “The country is run by the Constitution and the law of the land. One man has failed politically and they are trying to highlight controversies, make an issue out of these to brighten his career,” the senior BJP leader said.

Rijiju was here to launch the first edition of the Constitution of India in the Dogri language. “The Congress is in frustration and attacking the judiciary but the government will not stay silent,” Rijiju said when asked about a reported threat by a Congress leader to chop off the tongue of the judge in Surat who had convicted Gandhi in a 2019 criminal defamation case.

Gandhi’s conviction and two-year sentencing in the case over his Modi-surname remark led to his disqualification as a member of Lok Sabha last month. “It is the habit of the Congress (to issue threats against the judiciary). Even before the imposition of the Emergency in 1975, its leaders attacked the judiciary and they will make further attacks because of their frustration,” the law minister alleged.

""We are followers of the Constitution and if they try to tear apart the Constitution, we will not stay silent. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has rightly said that a person linked to dynastic politics is in danger and not democracy,"" he said.

While going from Jammu to Srinagar, Kiran Rijiju’s vehicle met with an accident in Ramban. The police described it as minor accident. The area is landslide prone where several mishaps have taken place in the past. The left side of the minister's car hit the right side of a truck. The police said the minister was driven to a safe destination. No injury was reported, but the minister could be seen shaking his hand apparently in pain.

‘Pendency concerning’

Law Minister Kiren Rijiju stated in a tweet that the pendency of cases has been touching 5 crore, which is a concern.

“I have committed to J&K that its courts will have modern facilities. Rs 7,000-crore will make courts paperless,” he added. ani

Money is taken from LIC, SBI and other banks to buy national assets'

Parliament was adjourned sine die on Thursday following incessant protests that pressed the JPC demand and the BJP's insistence that Rahul Gandhi apologise for his remark in the UK that democracy was in peril in India.

The joint Opposition on Thursday wondered what desperation lay behind the extent to which the Narendra Modi government went to shield Gautam Adani, preferring the washout of a Parliament session to a discussion or a joint parliamentary committee probe into the allegations against his business house.

Laying the blame for the washout at the government’s door, 20 Opposition parties stuck to their position that Parliament wasn’t allowed to function only because Modi wanted to avoid the Adani issue. The Opposition parties boycotted the customary tea hosted by the Lok Sabha Speaker on the last day of the session, and held a protest march with the national flag.

The leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, said: “I never saw in my 50-year legislative career that the government did not allow both the Houses to run only to avoid one question. Why is Adani given such importance? Shouldn’t we ask how Adani made Rs 12 lakh crore in two-and-a-half years? Money is taken from LIC, SBI and other banks to buy national assets.”

Kharge added: “With the nation’s resources, the nation’s assets are being bought by a businessman. Ports, airports, infrastructure, electricity, rail... nothing is spared. Why has the government facilitated this transfer? As if there was an agenda to make one man rich by any means. Why can’t Rahul Gandhi’s questions be answered? How did the Prime Minister help Adani get contracts in so many countries? Shouldn’t these issues be debated?”

Contending that a JPC probe would bring out the reality in a transparent manner, Kharge said: “Our questions were about scandals, about loot, about money laundering through shell companies, and they were shouting about Rahul Gandhi saying something in London. The two issues had no connection. It is clear there is a kind of nexus between the Prime Minister and Adani that they didn’t want to expose.”

The session, which saw the removal of the main Opposition voice from the Lok Sabha, witnessed the budget being passed amid din without any discussion. The Opposition demonstrated exceptional grit by staying united on floor strategy and resolving to work on a larger political coalition as well. Kharge is expected to call a meeting of the presidents of all Opposition parties soon.

On Rahul’s ouster, Kharge said: “A Gujarat MP who assaulted a Dalit doctor and was convicted by a court is protected from disqualification. But Rahul Gandhi is falsely accused of insulting the OBCs and disqualified in a day. Is this justice? Rules will be applied selectively? I congratulate all Opposition parties for staying united. But the government did not pay heed to the united voice of the Opposition. Is this democracy? Is this how Parliament is run? And if somebody says democracy is in peril, he is attacked.”

Warning against the drift towards dictatorship, Kharge said democracy would not survive if the government acted in this manner.

Representatives of 20 Opposition parties were present at the media conference with Kharge. DMK leader T.R. Baalu said: “The BJP is jittery after the success of the Bharat Jodo Yatra. They are scared of Rahul Gandhi and that’s why they conspired to throw him out of Parliament. First time I am seeing a ruling party disturb Parliament. But we will fight unitedly.”

K. Keshava Rao of the BRS, which nurtures a strident anti-Congress agenda, said: “You see all the political parties that had differences and maintained a distance. Now you see us together; we are becoming so strong. All the efforts to divide us have failed. We are on the same page and trying to evolve a common programme.”

He argued that leadership wasn’t a hurdle at this stage. The Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh detailed how Modi had helped Adani and was now refusing to order an investigation. The parties present included the NCP, DMK, JDU, Trinamul Congress, RJD, Shiv Sena, CPI, CPM, BRS, AAP, SP, IUML, NC, RSP, RLD, JMM, Kerala Congress, MDMK and the VCK, besides the Congress.","Laying the blame for the washout at the government’s door, 20 Opposition parties stuck to their position that Parliament wasn’t allowed to function only because Modi wanted to avoid the Adani issue.

Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said that the company, fully owned by a chinese national Chang Chian Ting, was a subcontractor for the Adani group and is a partner of Gautam Adani's brother.

The Congress on Thursday accused the Adani group of having business links with a Chinese company in all its infrastructure projects in roads railways, port, and airport sectors saying it posed a threat to national security.

The Adani group has not made any comments on the charges made by the Congress yet. The firm had earlier denied indulging in wrongdoing.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also cited a media report and said on Twitter, ""PMC Projects - ‘Pradhan Mantri Chinese’ Projects?"" ""Why are India’s critical ports, airstrips, railway tracks and electricity lines being built and controlled by a Chinese company?,"" he asked.

Shrinate said China made several transgressions along the border on the Indian side and killed 20 of our soldiers.

It changed names of places in Arunachal Pradesh thrice, but the links that a Chinese-owned company has with the Adani group shows Prime Minister Narendra Modi's special relationship with China, she said. ""This is totally anti-national."" ""If this is not a threat to national security, then what is?"" she added.

She alleged Modi gave a clean chit to China because of ""this relationship"" and that is why he has not broken his silence yet on either the China or the Adani issue.

""The veil now stands lifted,"" she said, and asked ""When will the government hold a probe into the Chinese company."" Shrinate also asked the government to find the source of Rs 20,000 crore alleged to have been found deposited in ""shell companies"" of Adani group.

AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh said on Twitter, ""Everyday the reason for the PM's eloquent silence on Chinese is becoming evident. This is largely because of Adani's intimate links to China. We had mentioned this first on March 3 in the 'Hum Adanike Hain Kaun' series and today there are further revelations."" Congress leader Amitabh Dubey also said the Congress has asked several questions on China and the Adani issue but the government is break its silence.

""Now this is an issue of national security and they will have to reply,"" Dubey said.","The Congress on Thursday accused the Adani group of having business links with a Chinese company in all its infrastructure projects in roads railways, port, and airport sectors saying it posed a threat to national security.

The BJP has now sought an explanation from Rahul Gandhi after Azad's claim.

By India Today News Desk: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has stepped up its attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, seeking an explanation, based on an interview of former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who said Rahul goes abroad and meets 'undesirable businessmen'.

'Who these businessmen are', the BJP has asked.

Ghulam Nabi Azad's claim of Rahul Gandhi meeting 'undesirable businessmen' came days after the latter took a swipe at some leaders who have quit the Congress in recent years as he kept up his offensive against the government over the Adani issue.

""They hide the truth, that's why they mislead everyday! The question remains the same - whose Rs 20,000 crore benami money is in Adani's companies?"" Gandhi asked in a tweet in Hindi and attached an image with the names of the leaders with that of Adani.

He cited the names of Ghulam Nabi Azad, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Kiran Kumar Reddy and Anil K Antony in his tweet.

Responding to the Adani tweet in which his name has been dragged, Ghulam Nabi Azad, who formed his own party after quitting the Congress, told a reporter, ""It is a shame. Rahul Gandhi is saying. I never had any association with any businessman. Whereas the entire family (Gandhi) is associated with businessmen including him.""

â€ætheir entire family (the Gandhis) have all along had association with businessmen, including him (Rahul Gandhi). He (Rahul) goes abroad and meets undesirable businessmenâ€æ

""I have great respect for the family. I don't want to speak anything against the family. Otherwise, I would have given examples of where he would go and meet undesirable businessmen even outside the country,"" Ghulam Nabi Azad said.

Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad released his memoir 'Azaad' in which he categorised Congress as 'bloopers and bombast'. In several interviews, he criticised Rahul Gandhi and said it was for Rahul Gandhi that he and many leaders exited the party.

Azad squarely blamed Rahul Gandhi for his ouster from the Congress. He also alleged that one had to be ""spineless"" to be in Congress.

RAHUL GANDHI POLITICAL ROW

Rahul Gandhi has been at the centre of a political row triggered by his Lok Sabha speech on Gautam Adani which got expunged in parts. The BJP has also demanded an apology for his 'democracy under attack' remarks in the UK.

Furthermore, he was convicted in a 2019 Modi-surname case and was disqualified from the Lok Sabha a day later. He also faced the party's ire for his Savarkar comment and now has been facing trouble for his 'Adani' tweet.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday said he will file a defamation case against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over a tweet that linked him to the Adani group.

""Whatever Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, it is a defamatory tweet. So once Prime Minister goes back from Assam we will respond to the tweet and definitely, there will be a defamation case in Guwahati,"" Himanta Biswa said.

This is a provisional list released by the Resolution Professional. Future Retail has been undergoing bankruptcy proceedings since July last year.

Incidentally, the RIL Group, the Adani Group, and WH Smith had been among the earlier list of final PRAs released in November last year. Future Retail has franchise rights from WH Smith Travel to operate its retail stores in India.

JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction was not on the earlier list. It is an active participant in buying stressed assets in India. Last year, it acquired a pool of non-performing assets from YES Bank for $1.4 billion.

None of the PRAs, who were shortlisted earlier, submitted resolution plans though the deadline was extended twice, the last being February 20. On March 23, the RP again invited expressions of interest with some differences. PRAs could submit a bid for the company as a whole (Option 1) or they could submit bids for clusters (Option 2), which the RP split into five.

Cluster classifications

Cluster 1 is the business of Future Retail on a standalone basis with large and small format stores. Cluster 2 is the stake of Future Retail in TNSI, running the WH Smith business. Cluster 3 is the gourmet food chain and food hall business. Cluster 4 is inventory and fixed assets at various locations, and Cluster 5 are the residual assets, investments, and brands that are not part of the other clusters.

Interested parties can submit resolution plans for either the first option or for any individual cluster or a combination of them. Weightage would be given to those who submit plans for the first option, that is the company as a whole.

The piecemeal sale of the company in the form of clusters has attracted interest from a good number of scrap dealers and waste recycling companies, as the list showed. They are likely eyeing the fixed assets of the company which is in the form of furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvement within the rented stores.

Store stats and dues

Future Retail’s store network has been considerably depleted by Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Retail acquiring the lease rights of many of the stores, as the Future Group was unable to pay rent.

At the end of 2020-21, the company had 1,308 stores across 397 cities. By July 2022, when insolvency proceedings commenced, it had only 300-odd leased stores of which 30 were large format stores and over 270 small format stores. Some of the stores have been taken over by the landlords for non-payment of dues and legal action is being taken against them.

As of March this year, lenders were claiming dues worth ₹21,555 crore, of which ₹19,183 crore has been admitted. Operational creditors, including employees, government agencies, and vendors were claiming dues worth about ₹9,300 crore, of which ₹8,230 crore has been admitted.

The final list of PRAs will be released on April 13, while the deadline for submitting resolution plans is May 15.","Forty-nine prospective resolution applicants (PRAs) have submitted expressions of interest for Future Retail, including Reliance Retail, Jindal Power, an Adani Group joint venture, UK-based travel retailer WH Smith Travel Ltd, and a number of scrap dealers and waste recyclers.

The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday accused the Centre of “gambling” with the hard-earned money of the citizens by continuing to invest money from the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in companies owned by the Adani Group.

Addressing a press conference here, senior party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said, “Despite warnings, an EPFO board meeting on March 27, chaired by the Union Labour and Employment Minister Bhupendra Yadav, decided to invest the provident fund money in Adani’s group, ignoring the risks to the future of the employees.”

Mr. Singh said after the expose by the Hindenburg report, international institutions had downgraded the rating and weightage of Adani Group companies and cautioned against investing in it due to uncertainty over the actual value of its shares.

AAP a liar: BJP

Reacting to Mr. Singh’s statements, Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said, “As usual AAP is a habitual liar, misleading the country by hiding important facts. The fact is that EPFO has invested in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through Nifty 50 a sum of ₹1.57 lakh crores in different stocks.”

He said EPFO has been investing in shares for many years, and even before the Modi government came to power, and added that the the decision to invest is taken by the board which consists of experts .

‘Robbing millions’

Addressing the Prime Minister, Mr. Singh asked, “Why do you have such an affinity for Adani? Why are you robbing millions of people to benefit Adani? You are taking money from institutions like LIC, SBI, and other banks to support Adani’s interests. And now, you are exploiting the PF money that is crucial for the lives of millions of people.”

Party national spokesperson Reena Gupta demanded that until a clean chit is given by the Supreme Court committee, both companies of the Adani Group should be removed from the NSE index to protect the investments of small and retired investors.

“Why is the government not taking this decision while indices across the world are removing Adani Group companies?” Ms. Gupta asked.

Mr. Singh alleged that the Modi government took a decision in 2015 to invest provident fund money in shares.

“They withdrew PF money, deducted from government and private employees, to buy shares in 50 companies, including Adani Ports and Adani Enterprises — two Adani companies that should have instead been under their scanner. A shocking ₹1.57 lakh crore continues to be invested in Nifty ETF and ₹38,000 crore is invested annually,” he said.

“If the ₹1.57 lakh crore belonging to 28 crore Indians sinks in the market, who will be responsible? The Prime Minister should answer this question,” he demanded.","‘Robbing millions’Addressing the Prime Minister, Mr. Singh asked, “Why do you have such an affinity for Adani?

On Monday, the Adani Group wrote a strongly worded letter to the editor of the publication asking it to take down the story. The group said that the article has created a “misleading narrative, misunderstanding in the markets, created a reputational impact on the Adani Group companies” and has become a political issue.

The report, “Indian data reveals Adani empire’s reliance on offshore funding”, appeared on March 22, 2023, and is available online on the FT website. An FT spokesperson told The Telegraph that the article is accurate and was carefully prepared. “We stand by our reporting,” the spokesperson said.

The report gave details of an analysis of India's FDI remittance statistics and claimed that almost half of all foreign direct investment into the conglomerate in recent years came from offshore entities linked to the Gautam Adani family.

The FT analysis showed statistics that offshore companies linked to the Adanis invested at least $2.6 billion in the group between 2017 and 2022, accounting for 45.4 per cent of the more than $5.7 billion received in total FDI during the same period.

""A quarter of the FDI flows into the Adani group of companies came from connected shell companies through a series of small and frequent investments. More recently the transactions have become larger and less recurrent,"" the report said.

“The data underlines how funds of unclear provenance have helped Adani build his sprawling group as he expanded a trading and plastics operation into an infrastructure giant while aligning himself with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda,” the report stated further.

“The full extent of money flows from connected offshore entities into Adani Group is likely to be even higher given FDI data only captures a portion of overseas investment.""

The FT has been reporting on the Adani Group and printed a few stories on the conglomerate. It has stated: “In the year to September 2022, Adani Group was one of India’s biggest recipients of money officially recorded as FDI, receiving 6 per cent of inflows into the country. Of the group’s $2.5 billion in catalogued FDI over the 12-month period, $526 million came from two Mauritius companies linked to the Adani family while nearly $2 billion came from Abu Dhabi’s International Holding Company.”

The report said that industry experts said the role of offshore entities makes an already Byzantine corporate structure even more opaque. Adani Group has hundreds of subsidiaries and has disclosed thousands of related-party transactions.

Jonas Heese, associate professor at Harvard Business School’s accounting and management unit, who was quoted in the report, said: “Why do you make it so complex that it’s very difficult for outsiders to understand? I think that is a legitimate question to ask.”

The FT has further said: “Adani, which strenuously denies Hindenburg’s allegations, declined to comment on why such a large proportion of its overseas funding came from companies whose ultimate source of funds was not clear. It also said ‘all these transactions are fully disclosed in our accounts and have been since 2015’.”

Also quoted in the report, Bala Vissa, professor of entrepreneurship and family enterprise, Insead, said that the opacity surrounding the Adani Group’s offshore entities is unusual for a company. “Experts say the opacity surrounding the Adani Group’s offshore entities is unusual for a company that relies on institutional capital for growth because established investors prefer to back companies they understand. Typically, ‘with this lack of transparency, you can’t grow that fast.”

The Adani Group response

In its response, the Adani Group said: “This story has driven misunderstanding in the market and with other media, and has become a political issue, we are compelled to share this information publicly at this time. That is regrettable but could have been avoided by your reporters taking a careful and objective approach.”

It added: “Our statement to your reporter, that all the transactions about which the Financial Times inquired have been publicly disclosed, is accurate, and the story amply demonstrates that your reporters conveniently chose not to look in a meaningful way at those public disclosures or even at the related media releases (including ones that the Financial Times covered at the time).”

It claimed: “The facts are easily available and transparent. They are available through relevant securities regulatory filings that were made at the time and are a matter of public record.”

The group said it was fully compliant with securities laws and have not obscured any information regarding promoter ownership and financing.

Here's a look at some issues when the NCP chief defied the Opposition, including its ally Congress, without downplaying the subject. All this in the last eight days.

On Vinayak Damodar Savarkar

Rahul Gandhi has often been targeting the BJP over Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. He gave a statement about Savarkar at a press conference after his disqualification from the membership of the Lok Sabha. Rahul was asked if he would apologise for the 'Modi surname' remark he had made in 2019, for which, he has been convicted by a Surat court.

To this question, Rahul Gandhi said, ""My name is not Savarkar, my name is Gandhi. Gandhi does not apologise to anyone.""

While the BJP targeted Rahul Gandhi over the remark, on the other hand, Uddhav Thackeray warned of breaking the alliance with the grand old party.

He said in clear words that the insult of Savarkar would not be tolerated. Amid the controversy between Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT), Sharad Pawar landed acted as a peacemaker. He had a meeting with Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi where he advised the Gandhi scion to avoid such statements.

According to sources, Rahul Gandhi assured in the meeting that he would refrain from making reference to Savarkar.

Following this, Sharad Pawar said during a programme in Nagpur, “Savarkar is not a national issue today, it is an old thing. We had said some things about Savarkar but they were not personal. It was against the Hindu Mahasabha. But there is another aspect to it as well. We cannot ignore the sacrifice made by Savarkar Ji for the freedom of the country.

He said, ""About 32 years ago, I spoke about the progressive ideas of Savarkar in Parliament. Savarkar built a house in Ratnagiri and also built a small temple in front of it. He appointed a person from the Valmiki community to perform the puja in the temple. I think it was a very progressive thing.""

On Adani Group-Hindenburg Row

Recently, after the Budget session of Parliament concluded, the House witnessed a massive uproar from the Opposition demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the US-based short seller's report flagging discrepancies in the Adani conglomerate.

But Sharad Pawar took a different stand on this issue.

Referring to the Hindenburg report in a recent interview, Sharad Pawar said, ""But this time too much attention has been given to this (Adani-Hindenburg) issue. Anyway, who gave the statements given in the report that came, and what is the background of it? When those people raise such issues, which in turn create a ruckus in the country, it affects our economy only. It seems that all this was done to target someone.""

Rebutting the JPC's demand on the Adani Group issue, Pawar had said that it would not be fair as out of 21, 15 members would be from the ruling party.

Referring to Pawar's statement, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that the NCP may have its own stand, but 19 opposition parties believe that the Adani issue was serious.

""I also want to make it clear that the NCP and other opposition parties are standing with us. Together they want to save democracy and defeat the BJP's divisive politics,"" he said.

In fact, on Sunday, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut stated the probe was necessary and that his party supported the demand. A probe monitored by the Supreme Court and an inquiry by a JPC can be done together, the Rajya Sabha member said.

What Is The Adani-Hindenburg Issue?

US-based Hindenburg Research recently released a report regarding the Adani Group led by Gautam Adani. It accused Adani Group of market manipulation and account fraud. The Gautam Adani-led Adani Group called these allegations baseless and misleading. It claimed that the public was misled by the report.

On Degree Case

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi and Punjab hit out at the BJP over the issue of PM Modi's educational degree.

Several leaders, including Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, had been questioning the degree of PM Modi.

Recently, AAP leader Manish Sisodia also raised the issue of PM Modi's degree by writing a letter from Tihar. AAP started the 'Degree Dikhao Campaign' and questioned on social media if the prime minister of the country should have basic qualifications.

On the other hand, Sharad Pawar dubbed the controversy as irrelevant in context of the political scenario of the country.

Sharad Pawar said, ""Today the question of degree is in front of the country, what is your degree, what is my degree, is it a political issue?"" Unemployment, law and order, and inflation are many such questions and the central government must be attacked on these issues. Today, differences are being created among people in the name of religion and caste. Today's crops were ruined in Maharashtra due to unseasonal rains, discussion on this is necessary.""

State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Adani-Total Gas Ltd and Shell were among the 29 companies that bid and bought natural gas to be produced from the deepest field in the KG-D6 block of Reliance Industries Ltd and bp, sources said.

IOC walked away with almost half of the 6 million standard cubic meters per day of gas sold in an e-auction on Wednesday while state-owned gas utility GAIL bought 0.7 mmscmd, Adani-Total Gas Ltd 0.4 mmscmd, Shell 0.5 mmscmd, GSPC 0.25 mmscmd and IGS another 0.5 mmscmd, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.

Reliance-bp on Wednesday held an e-auction for sale of gas from the MJ field in their eastern offshore KG-D6 block after incorporating the government’s new marketing rules to give CNG-selling city gas companies first priority over supplies.

The bidding saw participation from 41 companies from various sectors, including city gas, fertiliser, oil refinery, glass, ceramics and traders, sources said adding unlike previous auction Reliance did not buy any of KG-D6 gas.

The price was indexed to the global LNG market, JKM but will be subject to the government-notified ceiling price. Bidders were asked to quote variable ‘V’ in the gas price formula ‘JKM + V’.

The final bid price came at $0.75 per million British thermal unit premium over the JKM price (JKM + $0.75 per mmBtu), they said. JKM price for May is around $12.6 per mmBtu and the implied price for MJ gas comes to $13.35.

But the bidders will only have to pay the ceiling or the cap price that the government fixes bi-annually for gas produced from difficult areas such as deepsea and high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP).

The ceiling price for April to September is $12.12 per mmBtu, they said adding 29 bidders secured gas supplies for 5 years.

GAIL cornered the second highest quantity of 0.7 mmscmd while Adani-Total Gas Ltd took home 0.4 mmscmd. Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) bought 0.25 mmscmd while Shell and India Gas Solutions purchased 0.5 mmscmd each. — PTI

If one opposition candidate is fielded against the BJP in every constituency in...",None,"Adani Allegations Will Hurt BJP in 2024, Says Former Governor Satya Pal Malik","New Delhi: Satya Pal Malik, the outspoken former governor of Jammu and Kashmir, has said that the allegations of crony capitalism against the Narendra Modi government in light of the Adani crisis will have an impact on the 2024 general elections.

Malik, who served as the governor of Goa, J&K, Meghalaya and Bihar, commented on various issues during an interview with the YouTube channel DB Live. He discussed the Pulwama terror attack, the revocation of Article 370, the allegations against the Adani Group and the RSS’s influence on higher education institutes. The interview was published on YouTube on April 9.

﻿

He said that the Modi government does not have any defence against the allegations that it played a role in Gautam Adani’s meteoric rise. He agreed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi should have been allowed to speak in parliament, terming the speaker’s refusal to do so as “unprecedented”. Prime Minister Modi has still not answered Gandhi’s accusations regarding the source of Rs 20,000 crore in Adani companies.

The former governor said that the Adani matter has seeped into the common man. He quoted a song which he heard a woman singing, “Ye na chaiwala hai, na gai wala, Ambani Adani ka ye lagta saala hai. Is ne desh bech dala [He is neither a tea seller, nor a protector of cows. Looks like he is a relative of Ambani and Adani, he has sold the country].”

Referring to Modi’s statement that a supari [a hit job] had been taken out against him to sully his image, Malik said that if such a contract had been issued, it was “given to Adani”. Only the Adani allegations are ruining the prime minister’s reputation, he said. He added that the Adani matter will adversely affect BJP in the 2024 elections.

Malik has been a critic of the Modi government since the now-repealed three farm laws were passed. He had said in January last year that when he told the prime minister that 500 farmers had died in the protests against the law, Modi had asked, “Did they die for me?”

In the interview, he added that he had told the prime minister not to make enemies out of Sikhs and Jats and “quickly settle the farmers’ agitation”. He repeated the statement that Modi did not take the issue seriously.

Malik said that he will not join any party, but will campaign against the BJP for the 2024 general election. He said he is involved in talks to create a joint opposition to the BJP. If one opposition candidate is fielded against the BJP in every constituency in the 2024 elections, the saffron party will not get over 150 seats, he said.

Opinion on corruption, Pulwama and office of governor

The 76-year-old leader went into the details of an allegation he had made earlier that a private company had tried to bribe him Rs 300 crore while he was the governor of J&K. He revealed that the “RSS functionary” who was very interested in the deal was Ram Madhav. He rejected the proposal for which he was, he says, offered Rs 300 crore as a bribe. The day after he cancelled the proposal, Ram Madhav arrived at Raj Bhavan at 7 am, Malik claimed.

According to Malik, the RSS leader was very upset and asked, “Kaha aise kaise investment aaye ga? Maine kaha investment aaye ya na aaye mai galat kaam nahin karunga [How will we get such investment again? I replied, irrespective of investment, I will not do the wrong thing].”

During his tenure as J&K governor, Malik said that he told the CBI that some people were involved in the two deals, one of which was for a hydel power plant. These people were ‘manya pradhan mantri ke log‘ [the respected prime minister’s people].

On the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, Malik said that he was not kept in the loop about the movement of CRPF jawans. In the days before the attack, they had wanted an aircraft instead of travelling by road, but the request was rejected by the Union home ministry, he said. He said that the terror attack was the result of laparwahi (negligence) and incompetence and said that there was no conspiracy behind it.

Malik said that several of the vice-chancellors who have been appointed over the past year are not there on merit but due to their connection with the RSS. Many of them were “not fit to be principals of intermediate colleges”, he said. When he was governor, even he was under pressure to appoint some persons but he refused to do so.

He said that he left the post of governor of Goa because the prime minister was “supporting a corrupt chief minister of Goa”. While he did not go into the allegation, incumbent Pramod Sawant was the CM of Goa during Malik’s tenure as governor there, which lasted from November 2019 to August 2020.

Talking about the adversarial relations between several opposition-ruled governments and governors, Malik advocated for a change in the method of appointing persons to the constitutional post. He said that to ensure yes men are not appointed to the office of governor, the appointment should be done in consultation with the judiciary – similar to the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in the appointment of election commissioners.","Malik, who served as the governor of Goa, J&K, Meghalaya and Bihar, commented on various issues during an interview with the YouTube channel DB Live.

As per the Electricity Act, tariff hikes are made once in five years and the last tariff revision in Maharashtra was made three years ago.

The consumers in Maharashtra will have to pay more towards electricity bills as the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has approved a 5 to 10 percent hike in tariff from April 1. The MERC has allowed power distribution companies like BEST, TATA Power, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (MSEDCL) and Adani Electricity to increase the tariff.

Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) is a distribution licensee catering to a large consumer base across Maharashtra, including some areas in Mumbai.

Tata Power will hike the prices by 10 percent in 2023-24 and 21 percent in 2024-25 for up to 100 units for residential users. On the other hand, Adani Electricity will hike the tariff by 5 percent for residential users in 2023-24 and by another 2 percent next year.

Here is a comparison of electricity prices after the tariff hike:

Tata Power

2023-24 Tariff- Rs 6.79 to Rs 11.29 per kWh

2024-25 Tariff- Rs 8.05 to Rs 13.13

Adani Electricity

2023-24 Tariff- Rs 7.17 to Rs 10.10 per kWh

2024-25 Tariff- Rs 7.22 to Rs 10.19

Consumers will need to pay an additional cost for switching connections from Adani Electricity to Tata Power.

The cost for switching connection/shifting meters is Rs 100 for single-phase connections and Rs 200 for three-phase connections as per a 2017 circular issued by Tata Power.

Thus, the decision to make a switch should be carefully calculated based on the needs of the customers and overall cost in the long run.

On the other hand, consumers of MSEDCL will witness a 6 percent hike in both 2023-24 and 2024-25 and those using BEST will witness a hike of 6.19 percent in 2023-24 and 6.7 percent in 2024-25.

Why were the tariffs hiked?

As per an earlier report, the power companies of Maharashtra including, MSEDCL, BEST, Tata Power and Adani Electricity had sought the tariff hike due to the coal price increase.

ALSO READ| Maharashtra electricity tariffs likely to rise from April 1

The companies also faced losses during the COVID pandemic and the shortfall in the availability of renewable power was the contributing reason for the overall cost of power purchases shooting up.

As per the Electricity Act, tariff hikes are made once in five years and the last tariff revision in Maharashtra was made three years ago.

However, there is a provision for a mid-term hike by the MERC. Thus, to adjust the revenue gap after the increased power purchase cost a mid-term tariff hike was requested by the power companies.

The MERC conducted multiple meetings with all the stakeholders and then issued an order allowing an electricity tariff hike in Maharashtra with new rates being applicable from April 1.","The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) approved hikes in electricity tariffs by 5 to 10 percent.

Addressing a press meet at the party headquarter in the State Capital on Thursday, former Union Minister, Subodhkant Sahay attacked Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Central Government and said that there is no caste of thief and a thief is a thief. “The person about whom this thing was said is not even an applicant in the court. Rahul Gandhi has been punished for speaking the truth and making the Prime Minister's relationship with Adani public,” he added.



Sahay said that Mahatma Gandhi also did the Satyagraha movement against the British. “Today the beating of the Central Government is at its peak. Today, even in the Parliament, we are not being given a chance to speak. It was seen for the first time when the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were not allowed to run by the ruling party. 12,000 industries were closed in this State. We were demanding a special economic zone. But from port to airport and coal mine was given to only one person. Jai Bharat Satyagraha program is being organized on these issues. The program will conclude on April 16 at the old assembly ground, Dhurva,” he added.



Speaking on the occasion former Minister in the State Government, Bandhu Tirkey said that the Congress is fighting from road to house against the tax policy of the Central Government. “For 13 days, the Congress State In-Charge has been continuously involved in the program of Jai Bharat Satyagraha. The Central Government is playing with the constitution. In this closing ceremony, people from 18 blocks will participate in the program.

In its analysis, Forbes said...",None,"SEBI Has No Information on Who Subscribed to Adani Group’s Rs 20,000-Crore Share Sale: Report","New Delhi: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has said that it does not have the information on those who subscribed to the Rs 20,000-crore follow-on public offering (FPO) of Adani Enterprises, Business Standard reported.

The capital markets regulator said this in response to an application filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, which sought investor-wise and amount-wise subscription details and the reason for the cancellation of the FPO, the newspaper reported.

Two RTI applications were filed by one Prasenjit Bose on January 31 and February 8, it said. SEBI’s responses were submitted for these two applications, according to the report.

The chief public information officer refused to provide information on the first RTI application which had sought access to details on Adani Enterprises’ share sale. Bose had filed an appeal with the appellate authority on this ground, the newspaper said.

The appellate authority, per the newspaper, dismissing the appeal, noted: “The respondent, in response to the aforesaid queries, informed that the information sought is not available with SEBI.”

“…where the information sought is not a part of the record of a public authority, and where such information is not required to be maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate such non-available information and then furnish it to an applicant.”

The second RTI application sought details on any investigation by SEBI on the allegations made by Hindenburg Research. It also asked whether SEBI had received any complaint regarding stock price manipulation, round-tripping, accounting fraud and money laundering against the Adani group.

This information was also denied by the authority saying that “they were in the nature of seeking clarification or opinion and cannot be construed as ‘information'”, the newspaper reported.

The newspaper reported SEBI as saying that the information on exposure of public sector banks and financial institutions to the Adani group of companies is not maintained by the regulator in the normal course of the regulations.

After Hindenburg Research released its report on January 24, accusing the Adani Group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, the company’s stocks continued to fall.

Then, on February 1, the group decided to call off its fully subscribed Rs 20,000 crore ($2.5 billion) follow-on public offer (FPO).

Forbes reported in February that three investment funds that purchased shares in Adani Enterprises’ FPO have ties to the group.

In its analysis, Forbes said that “two Mauritius-based funds, Ayushmat Ltd and Elm Park Fund, and India-based Aviator Global Investment Fund, together agreed to buy 9.24% of all shares available to anchor investors.”

“That percentage represented an investment of just $66 million, but is likely more evidence of Adani getting help from affiliated parties.”

Anchor investors are institutional investors who are allotted shares a day before the share sale opens. Investment by anchor investors instills confidence in retail investors.

Gautam Adani said that the share sale had to be called off due to “volatility of the market” and assured investors their money back.

SEBI investigation

SEBI is probing Adani Group’s possible ‘related party’ transactions with offshore entities with links to Vinod Adani, the founder’s elder brother.

However, in July 2021, much before Hindenburg released its report, SEBI had written to the custodians of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) owning shares in six Adani Group firms, seeking information on their “ultimate beneficiary owners”.

These funds included Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund, and APMS Investment Fund.

These funds have the same address, as reported by The Wire, in a story that raised questions over Adani Group companies’ free float position, after Adani Group said that Vinod Adani and the group ‘should be seen as one‘.

The story analysed that in some group companies, a majority of the group’s investments’ free float has been held by offshore funds, including Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund, and APMS Investment Fund.

According to an analysis by the Morning Context, “if you remove these [offshore] funds, the effective [public] shareholding in Adani Enterprises comes down to only 10%.” In Adani Transmission, the “effective public float is about 7-8%”.

Listed companies are required to maintain a minimum public holding of 25%. Being listed is critical as it allows a company to raise money from the market.

Adani Green is the country’s largest green energy firm with a total installed capacity of 20,000 MW.

The company said it has commissioned a 325 MW wind power plant in Madhya Pradesh, a 212 MW solar power plant in Rajasthan, and India's first and the world's largest 2,140 MW solar-wind hybrid power plants in Rajasthan.

The capacity expansion is a part of the group’s larger strategy to reduce leverage levels by enhancing efficiency across verticals and boosting the group’s overall operating profit.

On 6 April, Mint first reported that the Adani group, in recent meetings with creditors, has outlined plans to lower the group’s leverage ratio from 4.1 times now to 3.1 by the end of FY24, chiefly by increasing earnings rather than reducing debt, which is worth around $23 billion.

The group plans to boost its operating profit by nearly 50% to around ₹91,000 crore over the next two fiscal years, helping lower its leverage ratios and assuaging the concerns of investors and creditors.

Adani’s new strategy draws significance in the backdrop of short-seller Hindenburg Research’s damning report on 24 January terming the group as over-leveraged.

The addition in Adani Green’s capacity may help the group work on its target to accelerate earnings growth to 20-22% during FY2024-25.

The group’s net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2013 was 7.6 times and declined to 3.2 in March 2022 but later increased to around 4.1 again during FY23, according to the Mint report. The group’s total debt stands at ₹2.27 trillion as on 31 March 2023.

Backed by the recent capacity addition, on Friday, Adani Green said its energy sales grew by 58% year-on-year to 14.9 billion units in FY23 compared to 9.43 billion in FY22.

“Adani Green aims to achieve a renewable energy capacity of 45 GW by 2030 and to keep average tariff below Average Power Purchase Cost at national level,"" said the company in an exchange filing on Friday.

Under the company's solar energy portfolio, the company recorded a 29% YoY growth in sales to 10,457 million units in FY23, primarily through the integration of SB Energy operational portfolio (1,700 MW) and the 212 MW capacity commissioned in Rajasthan during FY23, resulting in an effective operating capacity increase, said the filing. The integration has resulted in a 90 bps increase in capacity utilisation factor and a 50 bps improvement in grid availability.

Under the wind energy business, Adani Green reported a 37% YoY jump in sales to 1,820 million units in FY23 due to a capacity increase from 497 MW to 971 MW.

During the March quarter alone, Adani Green operationalised a 700 MW solar-wind hybrid project, taking the total hybrid capacity to 2,140 MW. The company's energy in the last quarter of FY2023 increased by 69% YoY to 428 million units, primarily due to 100% plant availability, the company said.

In an exchange with Business Today, the fund manager said, “My feeling is that probably the whole thing about Adani was overblown by the Hindenburg Group. They have their reasons for if you're shorting stock, you want all the bad hints to come out. But I don't think the reports by Hindenburg were completely accurate and on target.”

Mobius noted that the Adani family’s involvement and the high debt of the company was known way before Hindenburg’s report came out.

“Everyone knew that the family was involved in the company. There's no secret about that. And a number of other things they supposedly revealed were pretty well known by analysts. But the fact remains the debt levels were too high, this was also known,” the fund manager added.

The Hindenburg report, that came out on January 24, three days before Adani Enterprises FPO, alleged that the Adani Group had engaged in brazen stock manipulation, accounting fraud, improper use of offshore tax havens involving the promoters family. The report also flagged concerns about the group's high debt.

Mobius mentioned that the group has “incredible assets” and also noted GQG’s Rajeev Jain’s interest in the company. GQG Partners, led by Rajjev Jain, funnelled a little over Rs 15,000 crore in the Adani group in March after the Hindenburg fiasco hit the ports to energy conglomerate.

“There's no question that the Adani Group has some incredible assets. And if you know that some of these assets are quite irreplaceable, they're quite valuable going forward,” he said.

He also added, “Some investors, particularly Rajiv Jain in the US has put quite a lot of money in Adani because he felt that they have incredible assets and in the long run, this will go well.”

Mobius also stressed that since Indian banks have a lot of exposure to the conglomerate and hence are likely to help the group out.

The Adani Group owes money to the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, IndusInd Bank and others.

“The banks are in trouble. So the banks are going to have to support Adanis in order to ensure that their assets come back,” he explained.

Despite his belief that the issue was overblown by activist short sellers, Mobius noted that he stayed away from the company because of its high debt.

“The problem with Adani, of course, was the debt. The debt levels were too high. That is one of the reasons why we stayed away from Adani,” he said.

He further explained, “Also, they're a little bit too big for us. We tend to focus on smaller companies, medium sized companies, and we have a pretty strict rule we don't want companies with high debt. If the debt equity is higher than 50 per cent, we don't invest.”

Adani Green is the country’s largest green energy firm with a total installed capacity of 20,000 MW.

The company said it has commissioned a 325 MW wind power plant in Madhya Pradesh, a 212 MW solar power plant in Rajasthan, and India's first and the world's largest 2,140 MW solar-wind hybrid power plants in Rajasthan.

The capacity expansion is a part of the group’s larger strategy to reduce leverage levels by enhancing efficiency across verticals and boosting the group’s overall operating profit.

On 6 April, Mint first reported that the Adani group, in recent meetings with creditors, has outlined plans to lower the group’s leverage ratio from 4.1 times now to 3.1 by the end of FY24, chiefly by increasing earnings rather than reducing debt, which is worth around $23 billion.

The group plans to boost its operating profit by nearly 50% to around ₹91,000 crore over the next two fiscal years, helping lower its leverage ratios and assuaging the concerns of investors and creditors.

Adani’s new strategy draws significance in the backdrop of short-seller Hindenburg Research’s damning report on 24 January terming the group as over-leveraged.

The addition in Adani Green’s capacity may help the group work on its target to accelerate earnings growth to 20-22% during FY2024-25.

The group’s net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2013 was 7.6 times and declined to 3.2 in March 2022 but later increased to around 4.1 again during FY23, according to the Mint report. The group’s total debt stands at ₹2.27 trillion as on 31 March 2023.

Backed by the recent capacity addition, on Friday, Adani Green said its energy sales grew by 58% year-on-year to 14.9 billion units in FY23 compared to 9.43 billion in FY22.

“Adani Green aims to achieve a renewable energy capacity of 45 GW by 2030 and to keep average tariff below Average Power Purchase Cost at national level,"" said the company in an exchange filing on Friday.

Under the company's solar energy portfolio, the company recorded a 29% YoY growth in sales to 10,457 million units in FY23, primarily through the integration of SB Energy operational portfolio (1,700 MW) and the 212 MW capacity commissioned in Rajasthan during FY23, resulting in an effective operating capacity increase, said the filing. The integration has resulted in a 90 bps increase in capacity utilisation factor and a 50 bps improvement in grid availability.

Under the wind energy business, Adani Green reported a 37% YoY jump in sales to 1,820 million units in FY23 due to a capacity increase from 497 MW to 971 MW.

During the March quarter alone, Adani Green operationalised a 700 MW solar-wind hybrid project, taking the total hybrid capacity to 2,140 MW. The company's energy in the last quarter of FY2023 increased by 69% YoY to 428 million units, primarily due to 100% plant availability, the company said.

In an exchange with Business Today, the fund manager said, “My feeling is that probably the whole thing about Adani was overblown by the Hindenburg Group. They have their reasons for if you're shorting stock, you want all the bad hints to come out. But I don't think the reports by Hindenburg were completely accurate and on target.”

Mobius noted that the Adani family’s involvement and the high debt of the company was known way before Hindenburg’s report came out.

“Everyone knew that the family was involved in the company. There's no secret about that. And a number of other things they supposedly revealed were pretty well known by analysts. But the fact remains the debt levels were too high, this was also known,” the fund manager added.

The Hindenburg report, that came out on January 24, three days before Adani Enterprises FPO, alleged that the Adani Group had engaged in brazen stock manipulation, accounting fraud, improper use of offshore tax havens involving the promoters family. The report also flagged concerns about the group's high debt.

Mobius mentioned that the group has “incredible assets” and also noted GQG’s Rajeev Jain’s interest in the company. GQG Partners, led by Rajjev Jain, funnelled a little over Rs 15,000 crore in the Adani group in March after the Hindenburg fiasco hit the ports to energy conglomerate.

“There's no question that the Adani Group has some incredible assets. And if you know that some of these assets are quite irreplaceable, they're quite valuable going forward,” he said.

He also added, “Some investors, particularly Rajiv Jain in the US has put quite a lot of money in Adani because he felt that they have incredible assets and in the long run, this will go well.”

Mobius also stressed that since Indian banks have a lot of exposure to the conglomerate and hence are likely to help the group out.

The Adani Group owes money to the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, IndusInd Bank and others.

“The banks are in trouble. So the banks are going to have to support Adanis in order to ensure that their assets come back,” he explained.

Despite his belief that the issue was overblown by activist short sellers, Mobius noted that he stayed away from the company because of its high debt.

“The problem with Adani, of course, was the debt. The debt levels were too high. That is one of the reasons why we stayed away from Adani,” he said.

He further explained, “Also, they're a little bit too big for us. We tend to focus on smaller companies, medium sized companies, and we have a pretty strict rule we don't want companies with high debt. If the debt equity is higher than 50 per cent, we don't invest.”

After going through a blockbuster 2021 and a super flop 2022, investors were expecting 2023 to be a decent year …a year filled with new hopes.

However, it all went downhill as soon as US-based short seller Hindenburg issued a report on the Adani group.

The Adani-Hindenburg saga was followed by rising interest rates and the global banking crisis. One after the other, some event has kept the markets busy for the first three months of 2023.

But just like every cloud has a silver lining, there are stocks which continue to rise. These stocks go against the general market trend and come out on top.

In this article, we will talk about five such stocks. These stocks have rallied to hit their 52-week highs recently in dull market sentiment.

#1 L&T

The first name on this list is L&T.

Larsen & Toubro, commonly known as L&T, is an Indian multinational conglomerate.

It operates in engineering, construction, manufacturing, technology, information technology, and financial services. The company is headquartered in Mumbai.

L&T share price hit its 52-week high of ₹2,329.9 on 11 April 2023. In 2023 so far (up to 12 April), its share price is up 9.6%.

The engineering company has been in limelight on the back of repeat order wins and that too big ones. The company’s share price hit a record high on Monday this week after it emerged as the lowest bidder for the redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station.

On the same day, it also bagged a significant order for its hydrocarbon business. The business secured an order under its AdVENT (Advanced Value Engineering and Technology) business vertical from Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals.

In the last three months, L&T’s orders have grown substantially boosting investor confidence.

The government’s plans are to provide a significant thrust to the country’s infrastructure development. The plan was aided by a budgetary allocation of a massive ₹10 trillion (tn) capital investment plan of the government for the financial year 2023-24.

Right now, big orders and overall sectoral tailwinds are pushing L&T share price to a new peak. No wonder L&T is one of the top-performing stocks of March 2023.

#2 ITC

Second on the list is ITC. You probably guessed this stock when you opened this article…that’s how much the hype is surrounding the hotels to cigarette company.

ITC is India's biggest cigarette & one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. It has a 78% market share in cigarettes and a presence in other business segments such as staples, biscuits, and personal care products.

The company is also present in the paperboard, printing, & packaging business.

ITC hit a 52-week high of ₹398.2 on 11 April 2023. In 2023 so far (up to 11 April 2023), its share price has rallied 18.4%.

Imagine a big happy event that’s about to happen in your life. You and the people surrounding you would be excited way before the event actually happens, right? Something like this is also happening with ITC shares.

Lately, shares of ITC are on the rise because of a strong business outlook. The market is expecting robust performance from ITC in the fourth quarter of 2023.

With softening of major commodity prices, FMCG companies have taken price cuts and grammage increases in the last six months. This is expected to result in a volume uptick in the January-March quarter. Being a majority market shareholder an obvious benefit of this would be seen in ITC’s quarterly results.

ITC has delivered a resilient performance in the past few quarters, despite an uncertain demand environment and sustained inflationary pressures on margins.

The resilient performance was driven by a good recovery in its core cigarette business steady double-digit growth in the non-cigarette FMCG business, and accelerated growth in the hotel and paperboard, paper and packaging (PPP) business.

ITC share price also received a boost from budget 2023. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced to increase in agriculture credit target by more than 11% on a YoY basis in the budget. This is expected to benefit agriculture-driven stocks like ITC.

Also, on 7 April 2023, ITC announced that it divested its entire shareholding of 26% of the paid-up share capital held in its joint venture company, Espirit Hotels. Consequently, Espirit Hotels has ceased to be the company’s joint venture company.

#3 Bajaj Auto

Next on this list is Bajaj Auto.

Bajaj Auto is an Indian multinational automotive manufacturing company based in Pune. It manufactures motorcycles, scooters and auto rickshaws. Bajaj Auto is a part of the Bajaj Group.

It is the world's third-largest manufacturer of motorcycles and the second-largest in India. It is also the world's largest three-wheeler manufacturer.

Bajaj Auto share price hit a 52-week high of ₹4,305 on 12 April 2023. In 2023 so far (up to 12 April), its share price has rallied 19.9%.

The company was on the radar ever since it entered the much anticipated electric vehicle (EV) segment. The company has played the differentiation card in the EV game as it entered the premium segment.

The macro winds in the auto segment may keep the sales volume under pressure however premiumisation trend can act as a cushion.

The company is planning to sell 10,000 electric vehicle units per month eventually in the next 3-6 months, which is a significant target in India's growing EV market.

On 10 April 2023, it completed the transfer of Triumph’s India sales and marketing operations to Bajaj Auto. The transfer is linked to an announcement made in 2020, where a strategic partnership was announced between the two companies, to create a new range of mid-sized Triumph Motorcycles.

The new range is expected to launch in 2023. Reportedly two bikes are already under testing. The street is bullish on Bajaj Auto on account of the impending launch of Triumph bikes.

#4 Siemens

Fourth on this list is Siemens.

Siemens is a pioneer in infrastructure facilities, digitalisation, and electrification in India. It is one of the world's largest producers of energy-efficient resource-saving technologies.

Siemens share price hit a 52-week high of ₹3,400 on 10 April 2023. In 2023 so far (up to 12 April), its share price has rallied 17.9%. It is one of the top-performing large-cap stocks of 2023.

In budget 2023, the finance minister allocated ₹2.4 tn for the railways sector which is the highest ever outlay for the sector. The increased focus of the government on the development of the railway sector is a blessing for Siemens.

The order book of the company has been growing because of the shift in government focus.

In January 2023, the company won the biggest-ever railway order. It won an order of around ₹260 bn. It includes an order of 1,200 locomotives from the Indian railways. These 1,200 locomotives will be delivered over the period of 11 years followed by a maintenance period of 35 years.

The railways sector is witnessing big changes as the government became more transparent and driven toward modernisation and electrification of railways. The management of Siemens intends to be a part of this process of developing an efficient railway sector and in return gain big orders.

The focus of the government with the PLI scheme is on semiconductors, batteries, etc, and these are areas where Siemens is present, both in its technologies as well as in the software offerings.

Thus, Siemens is all set to play the upcoming railway capex theme.

#5 UltraTech Cement

Last on this list is UltraTech Cement.

UltraTech Cement is the largest manufacturer of grey cement, ready-mix concrete (RMC) and one of the largest manufacturers of white cement in India.

UltraTech Cement hit its 52-week high of ₹7,792.1 on 11 April 2023. In 2023 so far (up to 12 April), its share price has rallied 9.4%.

The rally is driven by tremendous sales volume. The company has achieved 100 million tonnes of production, dispatches, and sales in the financial year 2022-23. Its consolidated sales rose by 12.4% to 105.7 m tonnes (MT) in the said financial year.

Last month, the cement major announced the commissioning of a 1.3 MT per annum brownfield cement capacity at Hirmi in Chhattisgarh and a 2.8 MT per annum greenfield grinding capacity at Cuttack, Odisha.

Lately, cement stocks have been under pressure because of rising input costs. The company's profits were sinking due to high power and fuel costs. The price of input materials like coke and pet coke was also on the rise.

However, cement prices increased in February 2023 which gave a big boost to the company’s share price.

The Aditya Birla group company is not out of the woods yet as fuel prices or energy costs are likely to remain elevated for the next couple of months. Pet coke prices may also continue to rise.

However, strong demand in the cement sector may wipe off the negatives of rising prices. Cement manufacturing companies are expected to do well for the next few years on the back of better demand prospects led by infrastructure and housing sectors, heightened industry consolidation, and regulatory changes in the allotment of limestone blocks.

Factors such as continuous gain in market share, timely capacity expansion, and high capacity utilisation, are likely to provide the company with an edge over its peers.

Investment Takeaway

Stocks trading at 52-week highs are often considered attractive. Investors expect these stocks to continue their momentum for some time and rally some more because of the tailwinds they enjoy.

However, investors should be equally careful. Stocks hitting 52-week highs may or may not be trading at expensive valuations.

Also, the bright prospects driving the rally for the moment may soon drizzle out when the market sentiment changes for the worse. In that case, these stocks are no longer attractive.

In conclusion, rather than focusing more on the price action, your ultimate focus should be on the fundamentals and valuations.

""Former Governor Satyapal Malik has made sensational revelations in an interview. And now every effort is being made to suppress the things of this interview but the truth will not be suppressed. This is a very serious and important question, which is related to national security,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a press conference on Saturday.

Pulwama attack

In an interview with The Wire, Malik, who was the governor of J&K during the Pulwama terrorist attack in February 2019 and scrapping of Article 370, stated that he was asked to remain silent about the central government's lapses in handling the issue.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and NSA Ajit Doval allegedly asked Malik not to publicise issues relating to Pulwama when he questioned the 'intelligence failures' and 'incompetence' of the Union government.

In an extraordinarily revealing interview with Karan Thapar, Satyapal Malik says that the CRPF had asked for aircrafts ahead of the Pulwama tragedy, and the request was denied by the Union govt.



Full interview here: https://t.co/47ENX7WzM2 pic.twitter.com/7vISmPFGtz — The Wire (@thewire_in) April 14, 2023

Malik said that the Union government deliberately avoided sending help like helicopters to the site of attack to gain electoral benefits.

""When Satyapal Malik raises the issue of corruption in Goa in front of PM Modi, he is removed from there in a hurry. When he tells PM Modi on the Pulwama attack – it happened because of our mistake, the PM instructs him to 'keep quiet'. This is the misfortune of the country,"" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.

Malik was the governor of Jammu and Kashmir between August 2018 and October 2019, and in October 2021 he was the governor of Meghalaya.

Bribe for clearing 'Ambani' files

Malik has also alleged that the former BJP general secretary and senior RSS functionary Ram Madhav had offered him a bribe of Rs 300 crore to clear two files related to ""Ambani"" when he was the J-K governor. Madhav has dismissed the allegation as 'totally false'.

""The CBI has already thoroughly investigated the matter. I will be filing defamation charges against the peddlers of these false allegations very soon,"" the RSS leader said.

“The Prime Minister has no issues with corruption,” Rahul Gandhi tweeted while quoting the Wire's interview with Malik.

""Why is the CBI or ED not knocking at Ram Madhav's doors, given that a former governor has exposed him,"" Pawan Khera asked on Friday.



The Congress leader said the CBI had openly questioned the former governor at its headquarters but why has Ram Madhav has not been called for questioning yet.

""The ED-CBI raids or interrogates opposition leaders time and again, but why not BJP leaders? Why these double standards?"" he said.

Khera also played out the purported interview of Malik.

""If Malik is speaking the truth then why the CBI, ED or other agencies have not taken action against Madhav, else there should be action against Malik if his claims are untrue,"" he said.

Khera also claimed that Malik has sought Z-plus security as a former governor but he has only been provided a PSO and is living in his own house, whereas former Congres leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has been given a government bungalow and Z-plus security.

The Opposition party’s assertion came after a director in PMC Projects (India) Pvt Ltd Morris Chang, whose nationality triggered a row over the Adani group’s alleged links with Chinese entities, said, “I am a Taiwanese citizen.” Chang was being called a Chinese national because of his passport, linking the ports-to-energy conglomerate run by Gautam Adani to China. PMC Projects (India) Pvt Ltd constructs ports, terminals, rail lines, power lines and other infrastructure assets for Adani Group.

In a statement, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said that in the ‘Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun (HAHK)’ series under which the Congress posed questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the party had asked him about his “favourite business group’s links with the Chinese citizen Chang Chung-Ling (aka Lingo Chang) who has been a director in several Adani Group companies along with Vinod Adani and also made an appearance in the Panama Papers”. “We had pointed out that his son owns the Ahmedabad-based PMC Projects that has built ports, terminals, rail lines, power lines and other assets for the Adani Group. PMC was also alleged by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence to be involved in a Rs 5,500 crore power equipment over-invoicing scam,” Ramesh claimed.

Chang’s son Chang Chien-Ting (aka Morris Chang) has stated that he is a Taiwanese passport holder, he said. “He has however refused to answer other questions on which projects PMC has done for the Adani Group and his firm’s role in the power equipment over-invoicing scam. His statement has no bearing on the fact that our HAHK questions all along have focused on the Chinese citizen Chang Chung-Ling and his central role in Adani Group affairs,” Ramesh said.

The fact that his son owns a firm housed in an Adani-owned building and which builds infrastructure exclusively for the Adani Group only underscores the significance of ‘HAHK’, the Congress leader said.

“Given that the PM and the Adani Group have no incentive to provide answers, the only way forward is a Joint Parliamentary Committee to investigate all the relevant aspects of the PM-linked Adani Maha Mega Scam,” Ramesh said.

My passport shows I am a citizen of the Republic of China, which is how Taiwan is officially known. It is different from China, which is officially known as the People’s Republic of China.” he said He, however, refused to answer questions on the projects PMC was doing with the Adani group.

“I am a well-established industrialist in Taiwan with business interests in global trading, shipping, infra projects, ship-breaking, etc,” he said. “As far as the Adani Group is concerned, the matter is sub judice and I would refrain from commenting.” He did not elaborate.

“It is very unfortunate that my nationality is being called into question and made into a political issue. I have already explained my citizenship to you. I have nothing to do with politics,” Morris said The opposition led by the Congress has been seeking a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe in the Adani issue after the Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the Group.

Opposition parties have broadly agreed to keep contentious issues aside and contest the 2024 Lok Sabha elections together to take on the BJP , a senior opposition leader and former Union minister said on Friday amid efforts by top leaders of non-NDA parties to forge a united front. Earlier this week, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi held a series of meetings, including with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar , Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, RJD leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav and JD(U) President Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lallan.During these meetings, top opposition leaders broadly agreed that they will go to the people with issues on which there is consensus, the leader said.A proposal to form a committee, comprising leaders like Pawar, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury and Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav was also discussed during these meetings to reach out to political fence-sitters, the leader said. Trinamool Congress , Aam Aadmi Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party and Bharat Rashtara Samithi have not clearly spelt out their views on contesting the next Lok Sabha elections in alliance with the Congress and other like-minded parties.A suggestion for a common minimum programme of the opposition alliance was also discussed during the meetings chaired by Kharge.Rahul Gandhi's strident criticism of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar had created unease among the opposition camp with Shiv Sena (Thackeray faction) saying that hurling such insults at the freedom fighter will not help the Congress.""By insulting Savarkar, the sympathy for Rahul Gandhi will go down. In fact , it will be difficult for the Congress leaders in the state to face the public as Savarkar is present in every nook and corner of the state,"" read an editorial in Shiv Sena (UBT) mouthpiece 'Saamana' last month.Another issue is also the Congress' constant targeting of the Adani Group.Pawar's remarks about the Adani Group being targeted by ""little known"" financial research groups and the NCP leader favouring a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the group instead of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) was seen as a divergent view from that of Congress.However, Pawar later said he had merely stated his views and would defer to the collective opinion of the opposition favouring a JPC probe on the Adani issue after the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations against the Group. The Adani Group has denied all allegations.","If anyone is the successor of his thoughts, then it is Prime Minister Modi because he followed his path to create harmony in the society.” “Kya farak padta hai?

Along with the letter to Google the grand old party has shared its own research claiming video viewership on Rahul Gandhi’s YouTube channel fell to 3 million per week after his Adani controversy speech in the Parliament, from 6 million previously.

AICC sources said the request for enquiry has been sent last week to Alphabet’s CEO Sundar Pichai. The grand old party last month had urged YouTube’s chief product officer Neal Mohan demanding the crucial piece of information on their former party chief who’s popularity and reach is assumed to be augmented during the Bharat Jodo Yatra by over 10 million per week.

In the letter to Pichai, AICC data analytics chief Praveen Chakravarty, claimed that Rahul Gandhi’s YouTube channel “experienced a sudden and mysterious drop in viewership” after his Adani controversy speech in the Parliament which however stands expunged from the Parliament record as well.

Rahul is now stands disqualified as MP in Lok Sabha after being convicted by a Surat court last month. His appeal in this regard is to be heard on April 20 though the Gandhi scion started the process of vacating his Lutyens Bungalow on Friday.

“What explains such volatility? Surely, the sudden drop in viewership post a critical speech is not coincidence but suppression?”. This is a troubling pattern, especially when seemingly neutral social media platforms remain the lone outlets for opposition voices,” Chakravarty mentioned in his letter to Pichai.

This is not the first time Congress has raised issues pertaining to its social media alleged irregularities issues with other platforms including Facebook and microblogging website twitter.

In its last month communication to Neal Mohan as mentioned above, the party raised issues following which Google is understood to have conveyed to look into the matter. Congress mentioned that at one point of time the news content related to Rahul Gandhi and party reached to 11 million per week.

“Now almost like a switch was turned back on again. This is a troubling pattern, especially when seemingly neutral social media platforms remain the lone outlets for Opposition voices, Chakravarty wrote.

A senior Congress leader said that it is not a good sign if an independent international social media platform also gets under influence of a government or any institution/political party.

“When the national media was not giving us due coverage of the historic 4000 kms long Kanniyakumari to Kashmir Rahul Gandhi led Bharta Jodo Yatra for over four months then party took to social media platforms and there was immense support from the citizens and that continued until the famous Adani speech by our leader. Ever since then views dipped and it’s a concern as this is the only platform helping us to reach every nook and corner of the country. We hope Google look into such allegations by one of the worlds oldest political party,” expressed the leader to The Pioneer.","The Congress has written to Google parent company Alphabet seeking clarification whether there has been “suppression” of YouTube videos of or related to their leader Rahul Gandhi.

The group has made the payment well ahead of the anticipated deadline of 31 March.

The Adani group has issued a statement stating that they are committed to repaying the promoter leverage, which is a continuation of their previous commitment.

In addition to above, promoters have also prepaid $500 million facility taken for Ambuja acquisition financing, the statement said.

""This is in line with promoters’ commitment to increase equity contribution and promoters have now infused $2.6 billion out of total acquisition value of $6.6 billion for Ambuja and ACC,"" it added.

According to the statement, the entire prepayment programme of $2.65 billion has been completed within six weeks, which as per the Adani Group, testifies the strong liquidity management and access to capital at sponsor level, supplementing the solid capital prudency adopted at all portfolio companies.

At the beginning of this month, the group paid off loans worth Rs 7,374 crore. These loans were taken out against company shares as collateral and were due to mature in April 2025.

As a result of this prepayment, the promoters were able to access 155 million shares in Adani Ports, 31 million shares in Adani Transmission, and 11 million shares in Adani Green, reports Economic Times.

The prepayment was made as a result of the sale of stake worth Rs 15,000 crore in four Adani Group companies by promoters to GQG Partners.

The group made an announcement today, which coincided with reports that Gautam Adani may sell a partial stake in Ambuja Cements.

The purpose of this sale would be to raise around Rs 3,000 crore in order to pay off loans.

The group has undertaken several measures to prepay loans in order to alleviate investors' anxieties about the group's capacity to service debt, which was triggered by Hindenburg Research, a US-based short seller.

In January, a lengthy report was released by a short-seller that caused controversy. This report accused the group of various issues including corporate misgovernance, stock price manipulation, a high amount of debt, and negative cash flows, among other things.

The adverse event had caused a drastic decline in Adani stocks, leading to a consequential loss of the investors' assets.

Bank stocks were among the worst affected as Nifty Bank lost over 1,300 points or 3.1%.

In 1937, a hydrogen-powered German airship flying into New Jersey caught fire and crashed, killing 35 passengers on board. It was sort of a man-made disaster as some 100 people were loaded on to a balloon filled with the most flammable material in the universe. The airship was named Hindenburg. Eight decades later, in 2017, a graduate of international business management from the University of Connecticut founded a ""forensic financial research"" firm to specialise in spotting wrongdoings and frauds, or what it calls man-made disasters, at companies around the globe and take market bets against them. Founder Nathan (Nate) Anderson named his firm Hindenburg Research.Last week, a report from Hindenburg Research on Indian tycoon Gautam Adani 's business empire sparked a USD 51 billion sell-off in shares of his group companies, pushing him four places down on the world billionaire index The report said that the Adani Group had ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"". The disclosure came just ahead of Adani Enterprises ' Rs 20,000 crore open offer of shares to investors.Adani group has since rubbished the report as a ""malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations"". That, however, hasn't stopped investors from selling off.On Friday, shares of Adani Group companies continued their loosing streak for the second day with Adani Enterprises dropping a massive 18.5 per cent and Adani Ports & SEZ 16 per cent, taking the broader benchmark index -- the Sensex - down by 874.16 points or 1.45 per cent.Hindenburg engages in activist short selling, which involves selling borrowed stocks in hopes of buying at a lower price later. If prices fall expectedly, short sellers make a killing.Hindenburg, which invests its own capital, takes such bets based on its research, which looks for ""man-made disasters"" such as accounting irregularities, mismanagement and undisclosed related-party transactions.It especially looks for ""accounting irregularities; bad actors in management or key service provider roles; undisclosed related-party transactions; illegal/unethical business or financial reporting practices; and undisclosed regulatory, product, or financial issues"" in companies.""While we use fundamental analysis to aid our investment decision-making, we believe the most impactful research results from uncovering hard-to-find information from atypical sources,"" the company website says.Hindenburg's past targets include Lordstown Motors Corp (US), Kandi (China), Nikola Motor Company (US), Clover Health (US) and Tecnoglass (Colombia).Short sellers, however, aren't admired by most. Companies targeted by the activists have been pushing regulators to go after these short sellers as they may be indulging in some sort of insider trading. Supporters, however, say that the research actually uncover frauds and do more good than harm to investors.Not much is known about the company, besides its 38-year-old founder Anderson, who lived in Jerusalem, Israel before returning to the US where he first took up a consulting job with a financial data company FactSet and then worked at broker dealer firms in Washington DC and New York.Before he founded Hindenburg, Anderson worked with Harry Markopolos, who had flagged Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, to investigate Platinum Partners, a hedge fund that was eventually charged with fraud worth USD 1 billion.While living in Jerusalem, Anderson volunteered for a local ambulance service.Hindenburg is best known for its bet against electric truck maker Nikola Corp in September 2020 for its ""alleged lies and deceptions"" in years leading up to its proposed partnership with General Motors.Among dozens of other issues, it challenged a promotional video Nikola produced showing its electric truck cruising at high speed. This it said was nothing more than a truck being rolled down a hill in the Utah desert, a claim the company later admitted and its founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton resigning.Nikola, which agreed in 2021 to pay USD 125 million to settle a case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, listed in June 2020 and its valuation touched USD 34 billion at peak but is now worth USD 1.34 billion.Hindenburg's website lists over a dozen companies where it has flagged alleged wrongdoings. These include WINS Finance, which Hindenburg revealed had failed to disclose to US investors an RMB 350 million asset freeze imposed on one of its subsidiaries in China; the ""zombie company"" China Metal Resources Utilization which had a ""100 per cent downside"" and was ""under severe financial distress"" with ""numerous accounting irregularities''; SC Worx's ""completely bogus"" Covid-19 testing deal; ""massive undisclosed related party transactions, including a USD 509 million merger"" at HF Foods; ""billions of dollars in undisclosed off-balance sheet liabilities"" of Bloom Energy; and a whistleblower report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ""relating to RD Legal, a hedge fund that was later charged by the commission for allegedly making material misstatements to its investors"".Almost all of Hindenburg's work has been followed up by legal or regulatory action, according to its website.To take a short position, investors sell borrowed stock in hopes of buying it back at a lower price later. If prices fall expectedly, they make a killing. If the price rises instead, they would have to buy stock to 'cover' what they borrowed.Short sellers however aren't admired by most.

The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens,"" the group's lead head Jatin Jalundhwala said in a statement.The report and its unsubstantiated contents were designed to have a deleterious effect on the share values of Adani Group companies as Hindenburg Research, by their own admission, is positioned to benefit from a slide in Adani shares, he said.""We are deeply disturbed by this intentional and reckless attempt by a foreign entity to mislead the investor community and the general public, undermine the goodwill and reputation of the Adani Group and its leaders, and sabotage the FPO (Follow-on Public Offering) from Adani Enterprises,"" he said.""We are evaluating the relevant provisions under US and Indian laws for remedial and punitive action against Hindenburg Research.""The statement however did not say if the group is planning to sue Hindenburg.Hindenburg, a US-based investment research firm that specialises in activist short-selling, said on Wednesday that its two-year investigation revealed that Adani Group has ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.""The report came just as a Rs 20,000 crore follow-on share sale of Adani Enterprises opened for institutional investors. All the listed stocks of the group took a beating after the report.Adani Enterprises closed 1.54 per cent lower on Wednesday while Adani Ports & SEZ ended 6.3 per cent down.After the report came out, Adani Group had stated that it was shocked to see the report that was published without any attempt to contact it to get the factual matrix.""The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India's highest courts,"" the ports-to-energy conglomerate had said in a statement.It had gone on to question the timing of the report, saying its publication ahead of the FPO ""clearly betrays a brazen, malafide intention to undermine Adani Group's reputation with the principal objective of damaging"" the issue.""Gautam Adani, founder and chairman of Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly USD 120 billion, adding over USD 100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group's seven key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819 per cent in that period,"" the US researcher's report had said.The Hindenburg's report details a web of Adani-family controlled offshore shell entities in tax havens spanning the Caribbean and Mauritius to the United Arab Emirates, which it claims were used to facilitate corruption, money laundering and taxpayer theft, while siphoning off money from the group's listed companies.""Our research involved speaking with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of Adani Group, reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries,"" it said.

These petitions have been filed by advocate M L Sharma, advocate Vishal Tiwari and Congress leader Jaya Thakur.

While the first two pleas have been already been heard, the third one is slated to be heard as a part of the batch today (17 February).

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had already told a bench headed by the Chief Justice of India that it is completely equipped to deal with the fallout of the Hindenburg Research report.

Moreover, the central government has no objection to the constitution of a committee to examine the related issues, provided that the expertise of SEBI is not compromised.

First Petition — M L Sharma

Sharma was the first to move to the court seeking directions to the SEBI and the Home Ministry to conduct an enquiry and register an FIR against the founder of Hindenburg Research.

He contended that the organisation hatched a conspiracy by short-selling Adani stocks in hundreds of billion dollars, before concocting their report, thereby crashing the stock market.

Second Petition — Vishal Tiwari

Tiwari has sought an enquiry into the contents of the Hindenburg report by a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge.

He additionally sought setting up of a special committee to oversee the sanctioning policy for loans of more than Rs 500 crore.

He has stated that there has been no concrete step taken by the central government or the SEBI despite a massive attack being perpetrated against the economic system of the country.

Third Petition — Jaya Thakur

Congress Leader Jaya Thakur, sought prosecution of the Adani Group and questioned the investments made by SBI and LIC at an inflated price. She has pleaded for a probe under the supervision of a sitting Supreme Court judge.","Three petitions have been filed before the Supreme Court relating to the controversy created by the Hindenburg Research’s report on the Adani Group.

""The Supreme Court has taken cognisance of the matter. As a minister, if the Supreme Court is seized of the matter it is not right for me to comment. But in this, there is nothing for the BJP to hide and nothing to be afraid of,"" Shah said in an interview with ANI.

Using the Hindenburg-Adani row, the Congress and other opposition parties have accused the Narendra Modi government of favouritism and crony capitalism.

They raised the issue during the budget session of Parliament demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe. The opposition parties have also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue.

Asked about Rahul Gandhi's recent speech in Lok Sabha, which was almost entirely concerned the Adani group, Shah said it is for the Congress leader or his script writers to decide what speech he wants to give. ""What speech he wants to give is for him or his speech writers to think,"" he said.

Reacting to Rahul Gandhi's ""crony capitalism"" allegation against BJP, Shah said, ""There is no question. Nobody has been able to level such allegation against the BJP till date. During their (Congress) era, agencies be it CAG or CBI, they had registered cases taking cognisance of corruption. There were scams of Rs 12 lakh crore.""

Asked about allegations of Congress and other opposition parties of BJP ""capturing institutions"", Shah said they should go to the court noting that courts are not under the influence of BJP.

""Why don't they go to the court? Even at the time when Pegasus issue was raised, I had said go with proofs to the court...They only know how to create noise. Those who approached the court, the court took cognisance of Pegasus and also delivered its judgement. The investigation was also done,"" he added.

Replying to the question on BJP spokespersons indicating that there is ""conspiracy"" ahead of elections, he said it is for them to reply.

""Thousands of conspiracies cannot harm the truth. Truth shines bright like the sun. They have been doing it since 2002 against PM Narendra Modi.

Adani Group has dismissed the report as baseless and said it is considering whether to take legal action against the New York-based firm. The conglomerate termed the report on the group ‘malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale’ and is exploring legal action against the US investor on its report alleging ‘brazen’ market manipulation and accounting fraud by Asia’s richest man’s empire.

In a statement later on Twitter, Hindenburg said it fully stands by its report and would in fact welcome any legal action by Adani group. “If Adani is serious, it should also file suit in the U.S. where we operate. We have a long list of documents we would demand in a legal discovery process,"" the statement posted on Twitter read.

The Adani Group has been diversifying its business interests and last year bought cement firms ACC and Ambuja Cements from Switzerland's Holcim for $10.5 billion. ACC was down 15% on Friday, while Ambuja plunged up to 25%.

The most-liquid stocks controlled by the Adani Group, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd and Ambuja Cements, are also the most vulnerable in the event of an extended selloff in the diversified conglomerate’s shares, as per Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Nitin Chanduka.

Adani Group had announced the acquisition of Holcim's stake in Ambuja (63.19%) and stake in ACC (4.48%; Ambuja directly owns around 50% stake in ACC). Adani Group's open offer for a 26% stake each in Ambuja/ACC ended on September 9, 2022.

Adani Enterprises shares lost more than 19% on Friday, sliding below the ₹3,276 level at which anchor investors were allotted shares in the follow-on equity sale. Adani Transmission shares tumbled over 19% and Adani Total Gas sank 19.1% in their biggest daily drop since mid-March 2020, while Adani Green Energy sank about 16% on the BSE.

“It is the investor’s choice. We will not try and influence that. We definitely think there is merit in the group and we think the longer term prospects remain very robust. One cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt. I would definitely advocate a buy at least in the FPO and I would say Ambuja and the ports are looking very attractive at this price,” says, Director,Well that is a million dollar question. One report from five analysts who I have never heard of, Hindenburg comes and upsets the market. They come on the expiry day and tell them that they are short. It is all concerted. Whatever the outcome, it tells us how insider trading is very open right now. In fact, SEBI and stock exchanges should look to who had initiated this and where was the call writing and put and hence the option market.On Wednesday, out of a turnover of Rs 400 lakh crore, Rs 300 lakh crore was just the option. But on a more neutral note, the group has very good assets and there is no sovereign risk over here. LIC , the other banks, which I see no problem with. There is always going to be uncertainty when a group has made its market cap past Rs 20 lakh crore in the last five years but it is on the back of businesses which are there. So the debate is open.In a global context, India has underperformed this month and now is time to put your money where your mouth is. I do not see any changes coming on the LTCG on the negative side and if anything, there can be more proponents on capex and other things because the government is sitting on a much better balance sheet than before. I would say this is the lull before the storm of buying what you want because what the money had to go to China has already gone. I would definitely give Adani a subscribe over here. A disclosure, we have no holdings in Adani.Look at the top gainers – Bajaj Auto Tata Motors , Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero. The numbers from the auto side are excellent. When an economy turns, the first two sectors to turn are cement and auto and there are no two ways. I think Ambuja is a steal at this price.Aside from that, the holding company Adani Enterprise and Adani Ports. Adani Ports would be arguably the third best port in the world. So ignoring the corporate issues and the debt, we all know there are no such hidden things. Every six months something comes up like that and one can see the prerogative is the derailing the FPO.There are pros and cons but this is very well orchestrated where the option side is telling you that insiders had already taken position and perpetrated its report. The outcome of that is the market for you. But I definitely think cement, autos are telling you that the economy has turned and if anything, the Budget could be a trend setter and this is a very good time to buy select stocks definitely.Where have you seen 30% falls in two days? Now whether it is perpetrated or not, there are sovereign funds, there are enough people who have committed to the FPO. So it is a needle where you have to see whether you can ignore the noise and put your money in something which is giving you value, but it is the investor’s choice. We will not try and influence that. We definitely think there is merit in the group and we think the longer term prospects remain very robust. You cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt. Also, I think all their businesses are in fine shape.

The situation is even more worrying for those who have only a single source of income. Hence, amid these times of volatility, people are in search of lucrative investment plans that can guarantee them a regular and a fixed monthly income.

Most of the people are aware of the post office monthly income scheme which recently revised the interest rates for the scheme from January 2023. The investors are now getting 7.1 per cent per annum payable monthly.

However, today we will discuss another monthly income scheme provided by the largest public sector bank, State Bank of India (SBI).

One such investment plan offered by SBI is the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme which offers guaranteed returns, providing investors with assurance and the peace of mind they deserve.

Understanding SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme

In the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme, investors have to deposit one-time lump sum amount. After investment, investors receive re-payment of the same in monthly annuity installment comprising part of the principal amount plus interest on the reducing principal amount, compounded at quarterly rests and discounted to the monthly value.

In simpler terms, SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme allows investors to receive a predetermined monthly amount in return for their initial deposit in Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs). So, it works on the concept of a loan. Bank provides you the loan where you repay it along with the interest on the loan in EMIs. Similarly, in an annuity deposit scheme you give a certain amount to the bank and it repays you with interest on the invested amount.

SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme: Duration of the investment scheme

Customers of SBI can take advantage of the SBI Annuity Deposit scheme for a deposit period of 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. The scheme is available at all branches of the SBI.

SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme Eligibility

All resident individuals, including minors can invest in the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme while the mode of holding can be done singly or jointly.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Rules for Premature closure

The bank allows the premature closure for the SBI Annuity scheme depositors in case of death of the subscriber. Premature payment is also allowed for deposits up to Rs 15 lakh, however, penalty is chargeable as applicable to Term Deposits.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Facility for Loan

The scheme allows an overdraft or loan up to 75% of the annuity balance in certain circumstances.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Tax

Interest on SBI Annuity Deposits scheme is subject to TDS.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Maturity amount

In the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme, investors receive re-payment of their invested amount in monthly annuity installment comprising part of the principal amount plus interest on the reducing principal amount. So, the maturity amount is zero.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Interest rates

The interest rates provided on the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme are as applicable to term deposits chosen by the account holder.

SBI Annuity Deposit scheme: Payment date to customers by bank

Investors will start receiving the returns starting the first month's anniversary, if the date (29th, 30th, or 31st) is non-existent, the lender will make the repayment on the first day of the following month.

Annuity deposit scheme vs Fixed Deposit

In Fixed Deposit account, customers make one time Deposit and receive the maturity amount at maturity date which comprises principal and interest. Annuity Deposit accepts one time Deposit and amount is repaid to the customer over the pre-decided tenure selected by the investor, along with interest, in equated monthly installments. In FD, the investor's principal amount remains intact which is repaid after maturity, however, in SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme the invested amount is paid in full along with the interest by the bank during the pre-decided duration.

Annuity deposit scheme vs Post office MIS

The only difference between the two is that in the post office monthly income scheme, the investor gets the full invested amount after maturity, which is not the case in SBI Annuity Deposit scheme.","Understanding SBI Annuity Deposit SchemeIn the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme, investors have to deposit one-time lump sum amount.

SwarajyaMag,,,https://swarajyamag.com/business/hindenburg-adani-row-more-than-meets-the-eye,,None,Hindenburg-Adani Row: More Than Meets The Eye,"The Hindenburg episode has left mixed outcomes, both for the nation as well as for Adani Group.

It left behind some serious lessons for India on the potential risks in a globalised financial world.

At the same time, there are more questions than answers on the motives behind the bear operation and its potential gainers.

Adani Group deserves applause for a full subscription to the now-cancelled Rs 20,000 crore ($2.43 billion at current exchange) follow-on public offer (FPO) of Adani Enterprises. It reassured foreign institutional investors about the strength of the Indian market.

Failure of the issue could have triggered a pull-out by FIIs, leading to bloodshed in the market and serious hurdles to the Indian growth story. That explains why some quarters were unhappy to see that the issue sailed through.

Having said that, Adani Group deserves criticism for its poor, if not arrogant, public messaging for nearly a week from the publication of the Hindenburg report on 24 January to the cancellation of the FPO on 1 February.

It was not the content of the argument, but the tone of it, which made all the difference. The company forgot that they were dealing with investor sentiment. Chest-thumping and raking up national interest issues didn’t suit the occasion.

The communication disaster was finally corrected by group chairman Gautam Adani’s sober messaging. Unfortunately, by that time the damage was done.

More To It

In 1957, Indian diplomat V K Krishna Menon spoke for a record eight hours at the United Nations defending India’s territorial rights over Kashmir.

He tried to impress upon the audience that the Indian position was beyond doubt. Former Union minister Natwar Singh remarked in his book that many in the audience wondered why, if the issue was so simple, did it take so long to explain.

It is a matter of debate whether Adani’s 413-page counter to Hindenburg Research LLC helped soothe nerves in the stock market. Having said that, there is little doubt that the importance of the debate raked up by Hindenburg lies in its timing rather than the content.

The valuation debate is not new to Adani stocks. Compared with Gujarat Gas, the price-earning multiple of Adani Total will make heads spin. Screener, the stock analysis and screening tool, flags that despite the correction, the stock is traded 66 times its book value.

Adani Enterprises serves multiple purposes apart from trading. It is the holding company of the group and incubator for new businesses, which are yet to establish steady revenue streams. A mismatch between the trading volume and delivery has been a known issue with this stock.

In the market, higher delivery is indicative of investor buying. Low delivery normally stems from low float, and signifies the play of traders who square off deals during the day for opportunistic gains.

Such trade gives buoyancy to the stock. On the flipside, quick profit-booking by traders let Adani Enterprises' share bleed over the last 10-odd days. Investors are backing the stock.

According to a media report quoting Ace Equity, as on 2 February, the six-day average deliverable volume declined to 17.79 per cent from 25.21 per cent during 17-24 January.

Notably, Adani wanted to correct this mismatch by taking more shares to long-term investors, who don’t participate in day-trade, through the FPO.

The big question is: Who gained from its cancellation?

The group has a huge array of hard assets. With the Indian economy fully recovered from the pandemic impacts and is the fastest-growing among its peers, the cash boxes of Adani’s ports, airports, power generation and distribution business, coal mines, cement, and so on, will keep ringing.

Who Gains?

Here is a group that operates in scale and controls the entire value chain in the businesses they are present.

Take coal, for example. From mines in India and abroad, export-import trade, shipping to user industry — they are everywhere.

Adani focused on infrastructure and built a huge empire during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) era. The infrastructure focus of the Narendra Modi government helped them scale greater heights.

They are just too big to fail, and the decline in share value has nothing to do with business prospects.

Having said that, the Hindenburg episode may leave some peripheral impacts. The cancellation of the FPO and anticipated shelving of the $500 million overseas bond issue plan will delay the declared goals to repay part of the loans.

The decline in market capitalisation, coupled with the downgrading of the collateral value of Adani’s bonds, might hold the group from throwing its hats into new capital-intensive areas.

This is, however, a temporary impact. Analysts expect the spell to be over in six months to one year. During this period, Adani might prioritise its spending to earn a breather.

The question is, which are those areas and whether they have any implications for the future plans of the group?

The market is abuzz that Adani might slow down on its promised $50 billion foray in green hydrogen, which was potent to create a storm in India’s highly competitive energy sector.

The future will tell us which way Adani takes, but it’s hard to believe that one short seller in some faraway land can launch such a precision attack and have ramifications on the national economy and business space.

A short seller offers to sell shares without owning them. They expect to buy the shares at a lower value to complete the deal at a later date. Such ‘naked short selling’ is not allowed in India, but is legal in the United States (US).

Hindenburg took short positions in Adani Group companies through US-traded bonds and global receipt, and they declared it. Was it enough to cause such damage?

Normally, any bull or bear operation happens in a networked fashion and no one in the Indian market is ready to believe that it’s a simple case of an activist-investor taking on Adani, or India, all alone.

It is up to the country to find answers. It is not known whether the answers will ever reach the public domain. But, for now, the Hindenburg story seems too good to be true. There is surely more than meets the eye.

From that perspective, the bloodshed in Adani stocks is a minor incident. The design might be far more vicious than it seems, as an ace lawyer and ex-Solicitor General of India, Harish Salve, has claimed.","The Hindenburg episode has left mixed outcomes, both for the nation as well as for Adani Group.

As a result, not only did the shares fall by 30 per cent, but the offer which opened on 25 January, only saw a three per cent subscription by 30 January.

Even after Adani’s reply to the Hindenburg report, investors appeared unconvinced. After Adani’s response to Hindenburg’s allegations, Hindenburg said the company had only confirmed its key points, while not clarifying on some of the important issues.

However, Hindenburg is incentivised to criticise companies and managements, hence, reading too much into its opinions wouldn’t offer a balanced picture.

The Adani Group refused to reduce the offer price for FPO. An Abu Dhabi-based fund IHC, said that it would be investing $400 million in the FPO.

It appeared that the decision was correct since on the last day, the FPO was fully subscribed by investors. After the FPO was fully subscribed, the company said it would be wrong to accept investor money at a premium to the current stock price, and returned the money to investors.

After the late-night announcement, the group’s shares fell further during the morning session on Thursday (2 February).

Why Did The Company Accept Funds Only To Return Them?

One possible explanation is that the company expected share prices to rise once again after their reply to the Hindenburg report, and expected to regain investors’ faith. Hence, it decided to continue the FPO without reducing prices.

However, since share prices still continued to be lower, the group didn’t go ahead with the FPO and returned investor money.

According to an article by Forbes , there are specific facts that point towards allies helping the group complete its FPO. On the other hand, given the lacklustre response the FPO had received until the last day, it is also possible that the FPO was subscribed by the group to prevent a loss of face, since the FPO was the largest in India.

A single-digit subscription in the FPO by external investors might have signalled to the group that it needed to step in, to prevent the FPO from becoming a failure. It would also allow the company to show that it cares about investors while displaying its ability to raise money even during tough times.

Debt Investors’ Growing Worries

A part of the FPO money was to be invested in new projects, while another part was to be used to repay debt. Given that the group has a strong focus on infrastructure projects, it is necessary for it to take up debt to fund the projects.

Investors in the US, who trade Adani bonds, appear to be selling heavily. The bonds’ values have fallen to 69 cents on the dollar or lower. These bonds had rallied after the completion of the FPO, but fell back lower after the decision to return FPO funds to investors.

These distress levels are usually seen when investors believe that there could be a major impact on the business. The group’s leverage has been an oft-discussed topic in recent months, and the FPO issue appears to have made debt investors cautious.

According to reports, Credit Suisse’s private banking arm has stopped accepting the bonds of some Adani Group companies. Further, it is reported that the Reserve Bank of India is asking banks for details about their exposure to the Adani group.

After the report came out, the Hindenburg group hasn’t spoken about how exactly it went short on the bonds and other securities of the Adani group. Other short-sellers who know the group too, have been confused about how Hindenburg exactly bet on the group.

Is This The End Or The Beginning Of The Group’s Problems?

The debacle is a departure from the continuous successes that the group has achieved over the last few years. It had entered several new businesses with large investments, and the group received constant media attention.

Despite the allegations, if Adani group can make its infrastructure projects and acquisitions viable to pay debt and generate money for shareholders, these allegations wouldn’t mean much. But, perception often shapes reality, and if banks, media, and investors are sceptical of the group it might only make life tougher.

As the FPO episode showed, raising money from the public can be a difficult task, even if the stock has been one of the best wealth creators in years.

Further, regulatory bodies are reportedly stepping up their scrutiny of the group after the Hindenburg report went public, while the opposition is stepping up its criticism of the business group.

It would serve the group well to reduce its focus on growth at all costs, to focusing on profitability and corporate governance to win investor trust back.

SwarajyaMag,,,https://swarajyamag.com/business/why-adani-should-thank-hindenburg-he-can-now-focus-on-the-right-things,,None,Why Adani Should Thank Hindenburg: He Can Now Focus On The Right Things,"Gautam Adani, the man whose ports-to-FMCG conglomerate is at the centre of a storm raised by a Hindenburg report alleging fraud and other illegalities, has taken the first step towards redeeming his reputation by choosing to return the money raised by Adani Enterprises in the recent Rs 20,000 crore FPO (follow-on public offer).

It is possible that he got those investments from institutions and business houses on the promise that if the share price crashes, they would be compensated. Or, maybe the purpose of showing full subscription was to enable Adani to exit the FPO on a moral high.

He can now claim that he could raise large amounts of money despite all the adverse comments in the media and the crash in the group’s shares. But, whatever the truth, this is the right way to go.

In many ways, Adani should be thanking Hindenburg for the crash in his shares because credibility cannot be built on sand — the sands of fickle stock market valuations.

The media was focused on his alleged status as one of the world’s richest men, forgetting the fact that all this wealth is paper wealth, that can go up in smoke in a jiffy.

Also, he now does not have the option of funding his ambitions based on overvalued shares.

This will help him focus on his businesses rather than the surround-sound of wealth and fraud, which is what he needs to reckon with.

While the regulators and probe agencies must indeed start looking at any transgressions of the law, Adani himself needs a laser-sharp focus on only one thing: establishing the viability of his various businesses, which include not only ports, but also power, green energy, FMGC, cement, and media, the last two being recent acquisitions funded largely through debt.

Barring media, where profitability is always dicey, most of his other businesses are probably inherently bankable, but blighted by excess debt and unsustainable valuations.

The route to re-establishing his credibility with investors is by reducing his debt levels, improving cash flows and profitability and thus enabling investors to come back with renewed belief.

One of the first things ambitious businessmen must learn is to stay away from the media.

It is no coincidence that Adani’s own downfall was preceded by an India Today cover that crowned him Newsmaker of The Year 2022 and called him a Growth King.

In 2013, India Today had done another cover story on four Growth Kings, listing Dhirubhai Ambani, the GM Modi group, the Nandas of Escorts, and Vijay Mallya as these four.

Barring Dhirubhai’s son Mukesh Ambani, the rest are nowhere in the big leagues today. And even in the case of Ambani, the second son has not achieved the level of success that comes with the name. Mukesh himself must proceed on the assumption that Reliance’s success is not forever.

Gautam Adani would do well to read Phil Rosenzweig’s 2007 book, The Halo Effect , where the author points out that the mere fact of apparent success — high share prices, or high profits — are often used to deduce that there must be a high quality management underlying that success.

In fact, media tends to latch on to business icons only after the “success” is already visible to everyone, and when they put someone in their cover stories, they are essentially recognising something that is probably past its peak.

The same applies to stock market recommendations. If a broker says something is worth buying, it implies that he has already done so and wants you to follow suit so that he looks prophetic.

The lesson for all businessmen is clear: avoid the media, keep your heads down, keep debt down, grow quietly, and focus on the business, not publicity.

One of Rosenzweig’s pet ideas is that books like In Search of Excellence and Built To Last, which claimed to show the key elements of permanent or long-term business success, tend to err in terms of causality.

They connect the dots from outcome to causes post-facto, which can be dead wrong. Correlation is not causality. In the years after these books were published, most of the companies shown as great have faltered.

This is not to suggest that Adani’s best days are over, but it is best if he believes so and brings focus back to his business and emphasises corporate governance.

The probability is that many of his businesses are good in themselves for now, but they need careful execution and consistent effort — and some luck. The operative phrase in the previous sentence is “for now”.

Rosenzweig’s conclusion is that business success cannot last forever . Just as all humans must come to terms with their own ultimate mortality, so too must businesses.

Adani’s run of good luck ran out a week ago when Hindenburg decided that his balloon needed to be pricked. It is an ideal opportunity for Adani to prove the doomsayers wrong.","Or, maybe the purpose of showing full subscription was to enable Adani to exit the FPO on a moral high.

It was a bloodbath on Friday, with Adani stocks hitting lower circuits and some of them even witnessing a double-digit decline. The reason behind the free fall in Adani stocks would be Hindenburg Research's allegations over the Group. However, Adani has fought back by giving a much clear picture of its business portfolio.

On Friday, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas closed at 20% lower circuits each. While Adani Power and Adani Wilmar hit 5% lower circuits each. Adani Ports wasn't performing any better and tumbled by over 16% at the end of the day.

Meanwhile, Adani's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, which launched its FPO on Friday, nosedived by around 20% before closing at ₹2,762.15 apiece on BSE.

The first day of the FPO saw muted demand across investors.

Under the ₹20,000 crore worth FPO, on Friday, only 4,70,160 equity shares were bid against the offered size of 4,55,06,791 equity shares. The price band for the FPO is set from ₹3,112 to ₹3,276 per FPO equity share for all categories of investors.

If Adani's FPO is fully subscribed, then this will become the second largest follow-on public offer in India after Coal India's ₹22,558 crore issue in 2015. Earlier in 2020, Yes Bank had launched a ₹15,000 crore FPO.

But circumstances changed drastically a few days before Adani's FPO and it would be Hindenburg Research's report under which it accused Adani of stock manipulation and fraud schemes.

In its report on January 24, the New York-based investment research firm said, ""we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the ₹17.8 trillion ($218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.""

Hindenburg's report indicated that Gautam Adani, Founder, and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group’s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.

The findings of Hindenburg's research report on Adani involved interactions with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of Adani and also reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.

Also, the research said, even ""if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.""

Adani companies' debt was also among the key factors that Hindenburg pointed out.

It said, key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported ‘current ratios’ below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.

Hindenburg's research note came as a shock and Adani stocks went into frenzied selling.

Although, Adani has denied Hindenburg's accusations.

On January 27th, Adani Enterprises filed a presentation covering Adani Group’s response to Hindenburg Report. It was titled ""Myths of Short Seller"".

Hindenburg is the short seller.

According to Adani's presentation, Hindenburg asked 89 questions in total. While some of these questions are in regards to the group's related party transactions, DRI (Directorate of Revenue Intelligence), and court cases. However, there are 21 questions in total that cannot be claimed to be the result of any investigation over a 2-year period or any such assertion as they were disclosed in public documents all the way back from 2015 onwards.

Further, Adani said, 8 of 9 listed companies have a big 6 auditor such as Deloitte Haskins & Sells, SRBC & Co. (EY), SRBC & Co. (EY) & Dharmesh Parikh & Co. (Joint Auditors), Shah Dhandharia & Co., Ernst & Young, PKF, Walker Chandiok & Co. and K S Rao & Co., etc.

Moreover, on the leverage issue, Adani mentioned 100 of its various companies are rated ( these account for nearly 100% of its EBITDA). Also, in regards to revenue or balance sheet being artificially inflated or managed, it said, out of 9 listed companies in Adani portfolio — 6 are subject to specific sector regulatory review for revenue, costs, and capex.

Meanwhile, in terms of governance, 4 of Adani's large companies are in the top 7% of the peer group in Emerging markets or the sector or the world. On LAS position, Adani said, overall promoter leverage is less than 4% of promoter holding.

Earlier, on January 25, Jugeshinder Singh, Group CFO, Adani said, ""We are shocked that Hindenburg Research has published a report on 24 January 2023 without making any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix. The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless, and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts.""

""The timing of the report’s publication clearly betrays a brazen, mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group’s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming Follow-on Public Offering from Adani Enterprises, the biggest FPO ever in India,"" Singh added.

Also, on January 26, Jatin Jalundhwala, Group Head - Legal, Adani said, ""the maliciously mischievous, unresearched report published by Hindenburg Research on 24 Jan 2023 has adversely affected the Adani Group, our shareholders, and investors. The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens.""

Nevertheless, the panic selloffs in these seven stocks have led to a massive correction in Gautam Adani's net worth. Asia's richest man's wealth is to the tune of $92.7 billion as of January 28. As per Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Adani's net worth has dropped by $20.8 billion at the latest. However, year-to-date, Adani's wealth has dipped by $27.9 billion.","On Friday, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas closed at 20% lower circuits each.
If Adani's FPO is fully subscribed, then this will become the second largest follow-on public offer in India after Coal India's ₹22,558 crore issue in 2015.
Adani companies' debt was also among the key factors that Hindenburg pointed out.

Eight decades later, in 2017, a graduate of international business management from the University of Connecticut founded a ""forensic financial research"" firm to specialise in spotting wrongdoings and frauds, or what it calls man-made disasters, at companies around the globe and take market bets against them.

Opposition leaders across party lines on Saturday raised concerns about the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India and the State Bank of India’s (SBI) exposure to the Adani group, questioning the Union government’s silence on the issue.

On January 25, New York-based investor research firm, Hindenburg Research, had accused the Adani group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud”. Rejecting the charge, the ports-to-power conglomerate said that the allegations were “malicious, unsubstantiated, one-sided”. The report was timed to spoil the public listing of its shares in the capital markets, the Adani group claimed.

In a series of tweets, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Randeep Surjewala used publicly available data to show the dip in market capitalisation of government-controlled financial institutions due to the falling value of Adani shares. Noting that LIC was funded by “public money”, Mr. Surjewala said that the value of LIC’s investment in Adani Group shares had fallen from ₹77,000 crore to ₹53,000 crore, resulting in a loss of ₹23,500 crore, while LIC’s shares had lost ₹22,442 crore. He asked why LIC was still investing ₹300 crore in the Adani Group.

With regard to SBI, Mr. Surjewala noted that its market capitalisation had declined by a whopping ₹54,618 crore, adding that the banking sector’s loan exposure to the Adani group was ₹81,200 crore. Given this situation, he questioned why the SBI Employees Pension Fund and SBI Life were still investing ₹225 crore in the Adani Group.

‘Silence from the Centre’

The Congress leader also asked why Central agencies such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Enforcement Directorate, the Serious Frauds Investigation Office, and the Central Bureau of Investigation, as well as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, have all remained “mute”.

Priyanka Chaturvedi, deputy leader of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena faction in the Rajya Sabha, echoed his concerns. ”LIC saw 22% dip in its holdings in last two days, its share price fell 3.5% during the day and 5.3% over two days. This is Indian people’s hard earned savings which is being pumped in and sucked out. Hope SEBI and RBI are watching & acting,” she tweeted.

‘Banks will sink’

Trinamool Congress’ Rajya Sabha member Jawhar Sircar also tweeted, ”I know from 40 years in Government that LIC’s big investments need a nod from FM or PM. Don’t know why they’re out to destroy an excellent institution that caters to the middle class!”

“Swiss Credit Sights had warned long ago. Modi Government did not listen. Our banks will now sink — your money, my money will go down — while Adani goes away scot-free!” Mr. Sircar added.","On January 25, New York-based investor research firm, Hindenburg Research, had accused the Adani group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud”.

The FPO, the largest ever in India, aims to raise Rs 20,000 crores from investors. However, the response so far has been muted.

Institutions like mutual funds have not participated in the FPO, which could be a sign of caution among these investors. Hence, the investor acceptance of Adani Group’s explanations would be the key to its FPO’s success over the next two days.

How Has the Adani Group Responded to Hindenburg’s Allegations?

While Adani Group attempts to address most of the specific allegations made by Hindenburg, it begins by saying that the short seller's report must not be construed as an attack on the conglomerate but ""a calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India"".

“Hindenburg’s conduct is nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law,” Adani Group said in its response

In its previous official statement, Hindenburg had asked Adani to initiate legal proceedings against Hindenburg in the US. But so far, there have been no reports of legal action against Hindenburg. The Adani response said that not much is known about Hindenburg, its employees, its source of funding, and other details.

The Hindenburg report had raised 88 issues that the Adani group has answered in its 414-page response.

The Hindenburg report had several serious allegations, some of which included involvement with stock manipulator Ketan Parekh, shareholders, siphoning off funds from listed entities, use of shell companies, issues around financial reporting, and lack of disclosures.

Some of these allegations only highlighted past investigations of the Adani group’s activities.

Some allegations appear superficial and circumstantial in nature and are likely to have been levelled to highlight negatives. But other allegations were quite serious.

Adani’s Response Regarding its Public Shareholders

The Adani group’s shareholding has been a significant point of discussion over the past year as its stocks created immense wealth for shareholders. Media outlets had questioned the fact that investment funds that held a major part of the float were offshore companies. These funds had invested all of their assets under management only into Adani group’s stock.

Hindenburg claimed it had spoken to ex-employees at the company that ran one of the funds, who said that “Adani controls the shares”. Predictably, the Adani group has said that it is not related to any of these entities and that it is not legally required to keep any detailed information about its shareholders under Indian law.

Adani’s Response on Relations with Amircorp and Fugitives

Hindenburg alleged that Adani group had relations with Amicorp, a company that partook in shady financial activities and was involved in the $ 4.5 billion 1MDB scandal in Malaysia.

In its response, Adani group has said that Amicorp is a provider of secretarial services and is merely one of its many clients.

Hindenburg had questioned Gautam Adani’s elder brother Vinod Adani’s involvement with alleged market manipulator fugitive chartered accountant Dharmesh Doshi. The Adani group has said that the transactions were in the course of business, under all applicable laws and have been disclosed. It has also been said Vinod Adani doesn’t hold any managerial positions within the group or look after day-to-day affairs.

In multiple responses to Hindenburg’s other allegations of a large number of related party transactions and payments by listed entities to private Adani companies, the group said that the transactions were made on an arms-length basis, under the applicable laws, and were fully disclosed in public.

The group also said it had received a clean chit in the investigations Hindenburg had cited in its report.

What Happens if the FPO Fails?

While the Adani group has responded to Hindenburg, whether investors are satisfied with these responses remains to be seen.

Even before the FPO, Adani group was not a part of portfolios of mutual funds despite being a part of indices and one of the largest conglomerates in India. One of the reasons for this is the low availability of float and its relatively high valuation when measured in terms of sales or earnings multiples.

In an interview, the group’s chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh said that the company would postpone its expansion plans by 6 to 9 months in case the FPO is unsuccessful.

Of the Rs 20,000 crores the group is looking to raise, around Rs 11,000 crores were to be invested in new businesses, while Rs 4165 crores were to be used to repay borrowings, and the balance would be used for general corporate purposes. The stock was last trading at a discount to the FPO price due to the decline in stock price after the Hindenburg report came out. Yet, so far, no changes have been made to the FPO price.

SwarajyaMag,,,https://swarajyamag.com/commentary/what-could-the-hindenburg-report-mean-for-adani-group,,None,What Hindenburg Report Could Mean For Adani Group,"Over the last few years, stocks of the Adani Group have been some of the best wealth creators in the market. Over the last five years, the flagship group, Adani Enterprises alone, has seen its stock price go up seventeen fold.

The incredible performance of the stocks has created interest among retail shareholders while helping these stocks enter market indices as well. However, the success has brought increased scrutiny from investors, media, politicians, credit rating agencies, and regulatory authorities.

One of the reasons for the scrutiny was the group's high debt load, which stood at nearly Rs 2.2 lakh crore at the end of FY22. Nevertheless, the group clarified that a significant portion of the debt came from foreign lenders based on its strong credit rating.

CreditSights, a credit research company, came out with a report that called the group deeply overleveraged. But, a while later, the research organisation toned down its criticism of the group's leverage after a meeting with the company.

Just as the furore around its debt was dying down, a short-selling firm named Hindenburg Research came out with a research report titled ""Adani Group: How The World's 3rd Richest Man Is Pulling The Largest Con In Corporate History"".

The title of the report itself suggests the strong criticism it contains about the group. And investor reaction to the report has been quite strong – nearly $ 12 billion have been collectively wiped off Adani stocks.

What Does the Hindenburg Report Allege?

The report alleges that the group is or has been associated with activities such as stock manipulation, money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds, generating artificial revenues, and siphoning off money from listed entities and that members of the Adani family are involved in these activities.

One of the biggest questions surrounding the Adani Group has been the rapid rise in stock price without any significant participation by retail or institutional shareholders. The stocks have risen to relatively higher valuation levels than listed peers in domestic and global markets.

According to Hindenburg, the stock valuations of the group are nearly 85% higher than the fair value of the stock, measured by relative multiples. The report alleges that the promoters hold a significantly higher stake than the SEBI stipulated 75 per cent through various entities. After promoters, a significant portion of the shareholding is owned by ""funds"" that have invested their entire asset base into a single stock, which is unlikely to happen in funds.

Is The Adani Group Associated with Ketan Parekh and Amicorp?

The report alleges that SEBI had previously investigated the Adani Group for connections with stock manipulator Ketan Parekh. It says that Parekh's daughter had worked with Elara Capital, which runs one of the funds that has all of its assets in Adani stocks.

Hindenburg says that it has spoken to traders who had worked with Elara in the past and have directly admitted that the Adanis have a much higher stake in their company than is officially disclosed.

The report alleges that SEBI had previously pulled up the Adani group for colluding with Ketan Parekh to push up stock prices. The report has attempted to establish a continuing relationship between Parekh and the Adani group by citing that Parekh's London firm Orbit Investment Securities is run by Jayechund Jingree, a former director of Adani Global Limited, a Mauritius-based company.

Similarly, the report has alleged connections between the Adani Group and Amicorp, which it says is an organisation that aids in laundering money.

According to Hindenburg, Amicorp was one of the key players in the 1MDB scandal where $4.5 billion worth of taxpayer money was siphoned off. Further, it alleges the group's contact with fugitives, and the involvement of group patriarch Gautam Adani's brothers in activities that the government investigated. The report also suggests that shell companies launched by members of the Adani family were used to siphon off money from the Indian entities without proper disclosures.

What Could These Allegations Mean for The Adani Group?

Clearly, these allegations are quite serious and could have a potentially adverse impact on the Adani Group.

The Adani Group's forays into several new capital-intensive sectors like data centres, cement, and others have meant that it requires more capital. Hence, the group has been looking to tap the markets for more money through a follow-on public offer (FPO).

Hindenburg coming out with a report right before Adani's FPO could be a purposeful attempt to derail the company's finances and deter investors from pumping money into the company.

With a negative public perception, Adani Group might find it difficult to raise financing, increasing risks of default in the already leveraged group.

Why Did A Foreign Entity Raise This Issue?

Some have objected to a foreign entity raising these questions to tarnish an Indian conglomerate's reputation. Not many sell-side analysts or media persons have openly questioned large conglomerates in India – for a very good reason.

In the past, there have been cases where Indian stock analysts have been arrested for writing ""defamatory"" reports, allegedly at the behest of the companies they wrote reports against. As a result, many investors and analysts usually criticise companies in private but rarely in public. Further, short-selling is banned in India, which could make the market inefficient as short-sellers help balance the market by criticising companies when necessary.

In the past, only a Canada-based brokerage had written reports against Indian conglomerates but had to shut down its Indian operation after arrest warrants were issued against the analysts.

Suspicion Over Hindenburg's Timing

At the same time, it should be remembered that Hindenburg has short positions on the stocks before it comes out with a report, incentivising it to highlight only the negatives. Usually, all short sellers focus on constant attacks on the management, pose difficult questions during conference calls, attack the business models, and highlight past mistakes to precipitate a fall in the stock prices.

The short-sellers often rely on shock-and-awe techniques to gain attention.

Hindenburg itself has been a subject of investigation due to its practice of going short on the stocks before coming out with research reports. In addition, a significant part of the report focuses on past investigations and activities.

In a country like India, where bureaucracy and politicians wield significant extra-legal power, several large conglomerates have been under investigation. Sometimes these charges were genuine, while sometimes, they are simply made up only to create trouble.

If all investors in India were to only rely on past allegations, a significant chunk of publicly listed companies in India would not be investable. Yet, it would serve the Adani group well to clarify these issues and help investors understand the conglomerate better.

His comments come on a day when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi claimed in Lok Sabha that ""Mumbai airport, was taken away from GVK using agencies such as the CBI and the ED, and was given to Adani by the Government of India.""

Adani Group took over the management of the Mumbai airport from the GVK Group in July 2021. It currently owns 74 per cent stake in Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. The leading Infrastructure behemoth bought out 50.5 per cent from GVK Group and 23.5 per cent from minority partners including Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), and Bidvest Group. With eight airports (in its management and development portfolio), Adani Airport Holdings is now India's largest airport infrastructure company,

In an interview to television channel NDTV on Tuesday, Sanjay Reddy said, ""There was absolutely no pressure from the Adani group or anyone else for us to sell the Mumbai airport."" While explaining the circumstances that led to the sale of the airport, Reddy said the group was looking to raise funds for the airport business.

Elaborating on the transaction, Reddy said that they were attempting to raise funds since the debt raised for Bengaluru airport's acquisition was to be repaid. That's when they found three investors, just before the airport business was impacted by pandemic causing serious financial stress.

""That's when the firm was approached by Gautam Adani, who agreed to complete the transaction for Mumbai Airport in a month."" Reddy said.

""... He (Adani) said that he will assure that we will conclude the entire transaction in one month which was very important for us. So, from that perspective whatever we did was in the interest of the company and the lenders who we had to repay and therefore, we had to close the transaction with Adani because we didn't see any light of day with the other investors,"" Reddy said.

While leading the Opposition attack over the Adani-Hindenburg issue in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Gandhi alleged that the government tweaked rules in favour of Adani and said the clause that no one without any prior experience would be involved in the development of airports was done away with.

""This rule was changed by the government and Adani was given six airports. After that India's most strategic, profitable airport, Mumbai Airport, was taken away from GVK using agencies like the CBI, ED, and was given to Adani by the Government of India,"" he alleged.

They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities -- public companies, nine we have now, are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in India. Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement,” says, Group CFO,I will answer the second part first. Have we seen the exit of any large shareholders? From the data that we have as of the week, the answer is no. A lot of large institutional investors are long-term strategic infra, intergenerational investors. They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities -- public companies, nine we have now, are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in India.Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement. Therefore we do not expect it and neither has there been any movement in the long-term strategic investors and positions.On the first part of the question – yes, we saw short-term volatility and the share prices have consequently changed but again because the fundamental business has not altered in any way, we believe that this volatility will pass. In a week's time, our quarterly results will come out and people will see that the group continues on its upward trend and therefore we believe that over a period of time, it will be seen that we are a core infra utilities platform and therefore on a weekly basis, our cash flows do not alter.So to give you an example here, every week on average, our portfolio makes about Rs 1,100 crore. This Sunday also, that number was achieved. Next Sunday it will be the same, the following Sunday it will be the same. We believe that it will become clear to investors that this short-term volatility will be addressed as we go through over the next few months.As correctly highlighted, even in this report, I could not find anything with assets and performance of our businesses. So, they talk about promoter level debt. We hardly borrow on a corporate basis. At promoter level also, we do not borrow much. At a promoter level, we are net lenders to the market. Therefore, on a corporate basis also, we do not have much debt. On a promoter basis, as I explained, we are net lenders. So it is a completely unsubstantiated speculation that we have huge amounts of debt at promoter level.We are one of the few groups that formally declare total pledge positions on a regular basis quarterly. It goes out as part of our credit report which goes to all investors or banking partners or shareholders, even independent directors. So the informed investor is very clear that we do not have this. This report to that extent is mere speculation on that point of debt.On other aspects, we will discuss but as we go through this period, it has to be recognised and I would like to clarify for the public that for our large companies, say Adani Transmission or Adani Port or Adani Green or Adani Total Gas , their credit profile is similar to that of the government sovereign companies. We are the highest rated infrastructure portfolio in the country with the exception of the Government of India. This has to be seen in that context. We are very comfortable with this and we believe that it is a completely unsubstantiated rumour mongering though it affects us temporarily.False.No, it is nothing to do. Our promoter shareholding is both for India and we hold some of our shares from overseas. In our Holcim transaction, when we issued an open offer document, the entire structure of our overseas holding was fully disclosed. Our domestic holding structure has been disclosed in public documents for investors for the past 12 years.Therefore for anything beyond that, we are fully disclosed in our offering documents for investors, for regulators and for everybody. It is mere speculation and we cannot answer to speculation because this holding structure from family trust, intermediate companies and companies that hold shares domestically, be it Dubai to Mauritius, is fully disclosed in a comprehensive manner. Therefore they have made speculative charges that we control or do not control some company.They raised a specific question. We have addressed this in our rebuttal to that report. Now this is a specific question they asked. They said that in relation to Carmichael Rail and I am aware of this because this is part of AEL, we transferred an asset to a private company and then the private company immediately wrote down the value of their asset. So their implication is we over inflated Adani Enterprise revenue by writing off the asset in a private company. Now this charge is of malicious nature and that is my media statement because I knew this at that point in time also.This is the malicious nature of this report which is borderline lying and it is certainly a misrepresentation. First, we actually disclosed these ourselves that this is a related party transaction. Then we disclosed fully how the transaction was done. Now if somebody claims to have done two years of research, they would have known that this asset when you are transferred, had its accounting treatment known in Adani Enterprise. They could have seen from the same note that in Adani Enterprise, we had already written down the value of the assets and charged it to the P&L as a loss. They knew this and yet they still published this question.I am assuming they know this because they claim to have done two years of research. Now if they did not know this, then it is just purely ignorant and malicious. If they have knowingly done this, it is a case of genuine falsehoods and misrepresentation. So this is a clear example which we have highlighted and we have made public in our response, which is well over 400 pages fully annotated and we have attached the documents so people can verify themselves that 68 out of 88 are these types of questions they have asked.We borrow very little at the promoter level and we declare it and therefore the coverage that we have in relation to that borrowing is we have cash to actually pay the borrowings full stop. Therefore it is completely baseless that there were margin costs. Before margin cost, we will just pay and borrow and completely retire the shareholder loss.The FPO is as you know is a three-part process and we deliberately selected the FPO because we wanted to make sure and achieve certain outcomes; broader institutional participation, broader analyst coverage and actually broader HNI and retail participation.In the current situation or due to the volatility on Friday, the FPO price is below the retail target price. So we expect retail participation. We will wait to see how it goes but the long term investors see the value of the Adani Enterprise differently and they are fully committed for the FPO and we have no information that that has changed.Therefore we are moving ahead because we believe that with our institutional and strategic investor base, the offer will anyway be fully subscribed. Now once and that is why we clarify….that the FPO is proceeding as normal and the reason the confidence comes is because of the way long-term investors look at AEL value. AEL value is not in the share price of AEL. It is just a holding value.The real value of AEL is in incubating assets like Adani Airports, Adani Data Centre business, Adani new industry green hydrogen business, Adani Roads, Adani Digital Labs, Adani Wilmar and mining services business. Those businesses are still performing as they are and they still have the same value. Now that value will be exercised when we demerge this business in the next four to six years.So long-term strategic investors is what they are aiming for and that value has not changed because that is not representative of the AEL. The AEL share price is not representative of that value fully, it is a discounted value. So long-term investors are comfortable with the underlying value. Retail investors will see some pull back but even some ultra HNI and HNI will participate.Correct. Our objective on the retail investor base is twofold; one, we want to spread out the share register which is our objective and which we expect to complete by 2025-2026. Now in the short term, naturally some change will happen because of the possible pullback of retail investors but it is very important for us to understand what we want to do for the retail investor.We are in infra and being an asset-based company, it is very important that the Indian public owns its own assets. It would be good for the person going to Mumbai airport to own some shares because it is their asset, it is the assets of India. Indian public must participate and we want to encourage that participation. It is a bit of a disappointment that there will be some pullback, but in the longer term, we believe our objective to continue to encourage Indian retail investors will pay dividends and the wealth creation that Indian investors, retail investors should enjoy from Indian assets will occur. That is one of the key objectives of our founder and that the public should participate in the wealth creation of hard real assets in the country.Yes, Gujarat Ambuja shares were never pledged and we had clarified at that time also that it was a representation based on the very technical definition that Sebi has; the shares are never pledged. The way the acquisition of that nature is accomplished is that we tell our bankers and debt capital providers that we will hold a minimum number of shares and not the value of shares.So we are not sellers of our equity and we said we will own 63% odd of Ambuja shares which we own. So it is not a loan against shares, not pledged in any way. It is a security package which is different from pledge but that is counted in encumbrance by SEBI and that is why there was some misunderstanding and people misreported that as pledge.It is not for us to give a discount. It is important for us that there is a value equation here and that is based on the sum of parts of real assets being developed. We very carefully evaluated the events of last week and the consensus feedback was that you please go ahead as planned and that is what we are doing.We are in a position where last week we made an EBITDA portfolio level of Rs 1,100 crore. Next week, it would be the same and the week after that, would be the same. We are a non-discretionary consumer spending portfolio. Therefore, underlying businesses are as they are – super high credit quality, massive cash flows and therefore underlying business even their growth trajectory is not impacted by this let alone anything else.","Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement,” says, Group CFO,I will answer the second part first.

Among the 44 MFs, SBI Mutual Fund had the highest exposure of ₹6,142 crore to the Group, with the biggest investment of ₹2,776 crore in Adani Enterprises, followed by ₹1,816 crore in Adani Ports & SEZ and ₹790 crore in Ambuja Cements.

Kotak Mahindra MF had an investment of ₹2,329 crore — ₹1,080 crore in Adani Ports & SEZ, and ₹661 crore and ₹495 crore in Ambuja Cements and Adani Enterprises, respectively.

Nippon India MF and ICICI MF have almost same exposure of ₹2,095 crore and ₹2,092 crore to the Group. Nippon India MF had the highest holdings of ₹689 crore, ₹663 crore and ₹282 crore in Adani Ports and SEZ, Ambuja Cements and Adani Enterprises.

ICICI MF had the highest investment of ₹693 crore, ₹506 crore and ₹382 crore in Adani Ports & SEZ, Ambuja Cements and ACC. Other mutual funds which have over ₹1,000 crore exposure to Adani Group companies include Axis MF, HDFC MF, Quant MF, Tata MF and UTI MF.

Among Adani group companies, Ambuja Cement and Adani Ports and SEZ attracted the maximum investment of ₹8,204 crore and ₹7,996 crore, respectively, from MFs. Their investments in Adani Enterprises and ACC amounted to ₹5,097 crore and ₹3,744 crore, respectively.

Mutual funds invested ₹557 crore and ₹395 crore in Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission. Adani Green Energy, Adani Wilmar and Adani Power have MF investment of ₹374 crore, ₹15 crore and ₹6 crore, respectively. Exposure of most of the mutual funds to Adani Group companies are through their passive and index funds.

The sharp fall in Adani Group company stocks in the last two days will not have any immediate impact on the net asset value of equity schemes as they account for less than two per cent of the equity asset under management of ₹15.25-lakh crore of the mutual fund industry.

After investor wealth of about ₹1-lakh crore was eroded on Wednesday, the selling pressure in stocks of Adani Group companies intensified with most them caught in lower circuit on Friday.

Adani Ports lost nearly 20 per cent to hit two-year low at ₹572, while Adani Transmission, Adani Green and Adani Total Gas also lost 20 per cent each. Adani’s two new acquisitions — ACC lost 15 per cent, while Ambuja Cements shares crashed up to 25 per cent.

Adani Group’s flagship company Adani Enterprises tumbled 10 per cent, while Adani Power, Adani Wilmar and NDTV hit the 5 per cent lower circuit.

Devarsh Vakil, Deputy Head Retail Research, HDFC Securities, said dragged by massive selling mainly in Adani group and banking stocks, the benchmark equity indices have hit their three-month low.

Adani shares were in the line of fire with the Gautam Adani-controlled conglomerate losing over ₹3-lakh crore in market capitalisation on Friday, he added.","Kotak Mahindra MF had an investment of ₹2,329 crore — ₹1,080 crore in Adani Ports & SEZ, and ₹661 crore and ₹495 crore in Ambuja Cements and Adani Enterprises, respectively.

The Adani Group company’s FPO opened for subscription on January 27 and will continue till January 31. Adani Enterprises had filed a red herring prospectus with the markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for the Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offer (FPO).

This investment, IHC said in a release, is its first investment of the year as it intends to scale and diversify its investments locally and internationally, focusing on Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America markets in 2023.

“Our interest in Adani Group is driven by our confidence and belief in the fundamentals of Adani Enterprises Ltd; we see a strong potential for growth from a long-term perspective and added value to our shareholders,” said Syed Basar Shueb, Chief Executive Officer, IHC.

The release added this is the second investment deal International Holding Company has completed with India’s Adani Group after last year’s USD 2 billion investment in three green-focused listed companies of the group — Adani Green Energy, Adani Transmission, and Adani Enterprises.

“The advantage of the FPO is the historical reference for the company’s earnings report, company’s management, business practices, and much data to bank on before making any investment decision,” Shueb added.

The release said IHC continues to look ahead this year as its ambitious progression strategy gets well underway, with an expected further acquisition across four continents by the end of the year alone.

The UAE-based IHC aims to increase its global acquisition by 70 per cent in 2023, with the clean energy and food processing sectors being a key focus.

“We are watching the international market closely for new prospects, and we will continue exploring further opportunities outside our traditional market in 2023,” Shueb said.

However, if they would have read the article they would have realised Forbes provides no such evidence for its claim.

‘Speculations’ were presented as ‘evidence’

The report authored by John Hyatt for Forbes titled “There’s Evidence That The Adani Group Likely Bought Into Its Own $2.5 Billion Share Sale”, was based on speculations which were being passed off as evidence. The so-called evidence was based on the speculations made by some ‘experts’ and the fact that the two companies that were mentioned in the Hindenburg report were mentioned in the document listing underwriters for the sale.

In its report, Forbes said Elara Capital (India) Private Limited, a subsidiary of London-based investment firm Elara Capital, and Monarch Networth Capital, an Indian brokerage firm, were two of the underwriters in the list of ten companies provided disclosed by Adani.

In its report, Hindenburg claimed that Elara Capital’s India Opportunities Fund serves as a “stock parking entity” for Adani companies. Further, it claimed that Monarch Networth Capital has been partially owned by Adani Properties Private Limited. Also, it claimed Albula, an offshore fund identified as a proxy of Adani held a 10% ownership in Monarch.

Based on this information provided by Hinderburg in the report, Forbes speculated that the inclusion of these companies “could” mean Adani bought into its shares. The report read, “The involvement of Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital, however, raises questions about whether any of Adani’s funds were deployed to help meet the $2.5 billion target.”

Forbes claimed IHC (Abu Dhabi) offered a last-minute injection of $400 million after a call from Gautam Adani himself. Similar claims were made about Sajjan Jindal and Sunil Mittal, two well-established business tycoons in India. No such evidence of ‘last minute calls’ by Adani were given.

Forbes also quoted two experts in the report to give it weightage. A former investment banker with Citigroup and director of Australia-based Climate Energy Finance Tim Buckley was quoted saying, “It would be my speculation that there were insiders.” Forbes also quoted US hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman saying, “I would not find it surprising if the @AdaniOnline offering was rigged with affiliated buyers.”

The entire report was based on speculations made by the “experts” and information provided by Hindenburg and not any ‘evidence’ as the title suggested.","On February 1, Adani Group called off the fully subscribed FPO and said it would have not been morally correct to go ahead with the FPO after the share prices declined.

The petition is asking for the committee to be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge.

The petition has been filed by Advocate Vishal Tiwari, who asked that the case be listed urgently before a bench presided over by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud. Tiwari informed the court’s bench, which also included Justices PS Narasimha and JB Pardiwala, that a separate appeal filed over the matter is slated to be heard on February 10.

He requested the judge to hear his plea and the separate plea together on Friday. In his public interest lawsuit (PIL), Tiwari has also asked the court to order the formation of a special committee to supervise the sanctioning of loans of more than Rs 500 crore.

Another PIL was submitted in the Supreme Court last week by attorney M.L. Sharma, asking for the prosecution of short seller Nathan Anderson of the US company Hindenburg Research and his associates in India and the US for allegedly taking advantage of unsuspecting investors and the “artificial crashing” of the market value of Adani Group’s stocks.

The Adani Group equities have suffered on the stock exchanges following a slew of accusations from Hindenburg Research against the corporate behemoth, including illegal transactions and share-price manipulation. The Adani Group has denied the accusations, claiming that it abides by all legal and transparency obligations.","On Thursday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a petition asking for a directive to the Centre to establish a committee to examine the accusations made in the Hindenburg Research report against the Adani Group.

“We are shocked that Hindenburg Research published a report on 24 January 2023 without making any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix. The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts,” the Group said in a statement.

The Adani Group also raised questions over the timing of the Hindenburg Research report, stating that “the timing of the report’s publication clearly betrays a brazen, mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group’s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming Follow-on Public Offering from Adani Enterprises, the biggest FPO ever in India.”

“The investor community has always reposed faith in the Adani Group on the basis of detailed analysis and reports prepared by financial experts and leading national and international credit rating agencies. Our informed and knowledgeable investors are not influenced by one-sided, motivated and unsubstantiated reports with vested interests,” the statement further read.

“The Adani Group, which is India’s leader in infrastructure and job creation, is a diverse portfolio of market-leading businesses managed by CEOs of the highest professional calibre and overseen by experts in various fields for several decades. The Group has always been in compliance with all laws, regardless of jurisdiction, and maintains the highest standards of corporate governance,” the statement said.

Hindenburg Research report accuses Adani Group of fraud and stock price manipulation

Hindenburg Research, which claimed of having conducted an investigation for the last two years, said Gautam Adani, the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, has a net worth of approximately $120 billion, mainly due to an 819% average stock price growth in the group’s seven most significant publicly traded companies over the last three years.

The research involved interviewing multiple individuals, including former senior executives of the Adani Group, examining thousands of documents, and conducting due diligence site visits in nearly a dozen countries, Hindenburg Research said.

“Even if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its seven key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations,” said the forensic financial research company in its report.

The Adani companies listed as key have also accumulated substantial debt by using their overvalued stock shares as collateral for loans, which puts the financial stability of the entire group at risk.

There have been four major government investigations into alleged fraud by the Adani Group, with an estimated cost of $17 billion, which include accusations of money laundering, stealing of tax dollars and corruption.","The Adani Group on Wednesday trashed the Hindenburg Research report as a ‘malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations’.

(With inputs from agencies)

Shares of Adani Group companies remained under pressure for the third straight session on Monday with majority of them witnessing a crash yet again.The deepening market rout has now led to losses worth $65 billion in the group's stock values, according to a Reuters report.The current round of fall follows a report by Hindenburg Research last week which flagged concerns about the conglomerates debt levels and the use of tax havens.On Monday, Adani Transmission dropped 14.91%, Adani Green by 20%, Adani Total Gas by 20%, Adani Power by 5%, and Adani Wilmar by 5%.However, shares of flagship Adani Enterprises climbed 4.21% after its follow on public offer (FPO) was subscribed 2%.The developments also had an impact on the stock market which remained volatile during the entire session. Benchmark BSE sensex gyrated nearly 1,000 points intra-day before staging a smart comeback in late trades on selective buying.Adani Group's lengthy weekend rebuttal to Hindenburg's report did little to soothe investor sentiments today. The 3-day selloff has now erased nearly $65 billion market value amid a share sale by Adani’s flagship that was meant to underline the tycoon’s ascension on the global stage.While the Adani Group has portrayed Hindenburg’s allegations as baseless and an attack against India itself, the latter’s report is reviving longstanding investor concerns about the conglomerate’s corporate governance.The saga also threatens to weaken broader confidence in India, until recently a top investment destination for Wall Street, and accelerate a nascent shift toward a reopening China.The selloff is also fast eroding the wealth of Adani, Asia’s richest man, after his stocks were some of the best performers last year not just in the local market, but also on the broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index.From being the 4th richest in the global billionaire rankings till Wednesday last week, Adani has now dropped to the 8th spot with a total net worth of $88.2 billion, as per the Forbes real time billionaires list. However, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows Adani at 7th spot with a wealth of $92.7 billion.This is in sharp contrast to September last year, when Adani's wealth had surged to over $155 billion, making him the 2nd richest person in global billionaires ranking and the first Indian (and Asian) to break into the top 3 list.In a little over two and half years, Gautam Adani 's wealth had galloped over 13 times. In January 2020 just before the onset of Covid pandemic, his net worth was about $10 billion.In 1988, Gautam Adani had set up Adani Enterprises (then Adani Exports) to start a commodities trading business. Soon he set up Mundra port for captive export-import operations. Within a decade it also emerged as the biggest coal trading company in the country and one of India's largest foreign exchange earners.The Adani group had on Sunday slammed the Hindenburg report and likened the damning allegations to a ""calculated attack"" on India, its institutions and growth story, saying the allegations are ""nothing but a lie"".""Needless to say that Hindenburg has created these questions to divert the attention of its target audience while managing its short trades to benefit at the cost of investors,"" the group said.The Gautam Adani-led group also said that the report is selective and manipulative presentation of matters already in public domain to caste a false narrative.They also claimed that the Hindenburg report is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities.Some 65 of the 88 questions posed by Hindenburg are based on Adani’s public disclosures and the conduct of the American short seller ""is nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law,"" Adani Group statement said.The group further reiterated that it will ""exercise rights to pursue remedies to safeguard our stakeholders before all appropriate authorities.""The Adani Group's response comes ahead of the final few days of a $2.5 billion share sale by Adani Enterprises, which received overall subscriptions of 1% on Friday.""Mala fide intention is apparent given its timing when Adani Enterprises is undertaking the largest equity FPO,"" the group stated.US short seller Hindenburg Research rejected Adani Group's charge that its report was an attack on India, saying a ""fraud"" cannot be obfuscated by nationalism or a bloated response that ignored response to key allegations.Commenting on the 413-page response, Hindenburg said it believed India was a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future and it was Adani Group which was holding it back through ""systematic loot"".Hindenburg stood by its last week's report that said its two-year investigation found Adani Group ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"".Hindenburg said the response by the conglomerate run by Asia's richest man Gautam Adani ""opened with the sensationalistic claim that we are the 'Madoffs of Manhattan'.""Hindenburg responded saying Adani Group ""predictably tried to lead the focus away from substantive issues and instead stoked a nationalist narrative.""""Adani Group has attempted to conflate its meteoric rise and the wealth of its chairman, Gautam Adani, with the success of India itself,"" it said.""We disagree. To be clear, we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future. We also believe India's future is being held back by Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation.""Stating that a ""fraud is fraud even when it's perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world,"" it said Adani's '413-page' response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to the report.According to a report by Reuters, state-run Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), India's largest insurer, is reviewing Adani Group's response to scathing criticism by a US short-seller and will hold talks with the group's management within days.""Presently there is a situation that's emerging and we are not sure what is the factual position ... Since we are a large investor, we have the right to ask relevant questions and we will definitely engage with them,"" LIC managing director Raj Kumar told Reuters.LIC says it has invested Rs 36,470 crore ($4.47 billion) in Adani companies, about 1% of its assets under management.""Of course, we are studying the 413-page reply given by Adani Group,"" Kumar said on Monday about the group's response to concerns raised by Hindenburg.""We will also see if the concerns are addressed. If we believe the concerns are not addressed, we will seek further clarification from them.""LIC owned a 4.23% stake in the flagship Adani Enterprises as of end-December, more than 9% in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, nearly 6% in Adani Total Gas and 3.65% in Adani Transmission, data from the Bombay Stock Exchange shows.Dollar bonds issued by entities of Adani Group continued to fall on Monday following a scathing report by a US short seller which triggered a rout in the conglomerate's listed firms.US dollar-denominated bonds issued by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone continued their fall into a second week with the bond maturing in August 2027 down 5 cents to 73.03 cents, the lowest since June 2020.International bonds issued by Adani Green Energy, Adani Economic Zone, Adani Transmission and Adani Electricity Mumbai also fell.","""The Adani Group's response comes ahead of the final few days of a $2.5 billion share sale by Adani Enterprises, which received overall subscriptions of 1% on Friday.

During his address, the Wayanad MP took up the Adani controversy in the parliament. Rahul Gandhi went on to relentlessly make ridiculous statements during his address.

Rahul Gandhi said, “From Tamil Nadu, Kerala to Himachal Pradesh we have been listening to one name everywhere ‘Adani’. Across the entire country, it’s just ‘Adani’, ‘Adani’, and ‘Adani’.”

From Tamil Nadu, Kerala to Himachal Pradesh we have been listening one name everywhere ‘Adani’.

He further said, “People used to ask me if Adani enters any business and never fails. The youth asked us, Adani is now in 8-10 sectors & that how his net worth reached $140 billion from $8 billion from 2014 to 2022.”

Taking his imagination to a next level, Rahul Gandhi added, “Only Adani is being talked about from apples of Kashmir, Himachal to ports, airports, and even the roads we are walking on.”

Rahul Gandhi then tried to establish a relationship between the businessman and PM Narendra Modi. He said, “Relationships begins many years ago when Narendra Modi was Gujarat’s CM. One man stood shoulder to shoulder with PM Modi, he was loyal to the PM and helped Mr Modi to construct the idea of a Resurgent Gujarat. Real magic began when PM Modi reached Delhi in 2014.”

Taking a jibe at Adani getting contracts to operate airports, Rahul Gandhi said, “There’s a rule who doesn’t have prior experience in airports can’t be involved in the development of airports. This rule was changed by the Government of India. This rule was changed & Adani was given six airports. After that India’s most profitable airport ‘Mumbai Airpot’ was hijacked from GVK using agencies like CBI, and ED & was given to Adani by Govt of India.”

However, BJP MP Dr Nishikant Dubey replied in the Lok Sabha saying that the rules regarding the infrastructure companies GMR and GVK were changed by the UPA government led by former PM Dr Manmohan Singh.

After this, the Congress leader commented on the undertakings of the Adani group in various sectors. He said, “Now, Adani has zero experience in the defence sector. Yesterday PM said at HAL that we hurled the wrong allegations. But in reality, HAL’s contract of 126 aircraft went to Anil Ambani.” Rahul Gandhi was referring to the allegations of wrongdoing in the Rafale deal despite the apex court of the country expressly stating that it did not find malpractices in the said deal.

Rahul Gandhi seems to have drawn no lessons from the Rafale deal fiasco when he and his ecosystem tried very hard to project PM Modi as corrupt but ended up humiliating themselves when the Supreme Court said there was wrongdoing in the deal.

He added, “Adani never made drones but HAL and other companies in India do that. Despite that PM, Modi goes to Israel and Adani gets the contract.”

Rahul Gandhi also tried to establish a correlation between PM Modi’s tours and various contracts secured by the Adani group. He said, “PM Modi goes to Australia and by magic, SBI gives a $1 billion loan to Adani. Then he goes to Bangladesh & then the Bangladesh Power development board signs a 25-yrs contract with Adani.”

What Rahul Gandhi has insinuated is that Adani has not won any contract due to his competitiveness, effective pricing, or any other business factor, but PM Modi has helped him in landing projects. Of course, the Gandhi scion has no proof to back the claim and relies on rhetoric to further his allegations—to paint PM Modi with the same brush as that of Congress—corruption.

Intriguingly, the Wayanad MP did not mention when Adani visited the Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, his company got contracts worth Rs 60,000 crores and Rs 1000 crores respectively in those states. Contradictorily, Rahul Gandhi had at that time defended the Rajasthan government’s decision.

Rahul Gandhi also made a serious allegation about India’s foreign policy by saying that it is designed in a way that suits to benefit the Adani group. He said, “In 2022, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka electricity board informed the parliamentary committee in Sri Lanka that he was told by Sri Lanka’s President Rajapaksa that he was pressured by PM Modi to give a wind power project to Mr Adani. This isn’t India’s foreign policy, it’s the policy for Adani’s business.”

After this, he asked questions about the electoral bonds and money allegedly given by Gautam Adani to the Bharatiya Janata Party. He said, “Earlier PM Modi used to travel in Adani’s aircraft now Adani travels in Modiji’s aircraft. This matter was earlier of Gujarat, then became of India, and now has become international. How much money did Adani give to BJP in the last 20 yrs & through electoral bonds?”

Rahul Gandhi then flagged some posters of photographs of Gautam Adani with BJP leaders. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, at this time, instructed him not to do so. Om Birla said, “No posters please, if you will show posters then this side (BJP) will show posters of Rajasthan’s CM (with Gautam Adani). Showing posters isn’t appropriate.”

Refuting Rahul Gandhi’s allegations, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “We condemn the baseless allegations levelled by Rahul Gandhi against our govt while speaking in Parliament today.

It is notable that Adani Group stocks have suffered sharp losses due to allegations of fraud from Hindenburg Research. The investment firm had accused the Adani Group of accounting fraud and stock manipulation, triggering stock prices of its companies to hit lower circuits. The Group has, however, denied the allegations and accused Hindenburg Research of spreading malicious disinformation.","On 7th February 2023, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi delivered a speech in the Lok Sabha.

“For decades, Wachtell has been among the most sought-after advisers by besieged corporate boards at some of the largest US companies trying to fend off activist investors or hostile takeovers,” the FT said in its article. Apparently, Wachtell is the same firm that tech billionaire Elon Musk had hired to fight his case against Twitter.

According to the report, Wachtell was approached by the Adani conglomerate through the office of the Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas firm, which is spearheading the defence of Adani Group. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas is led by Cyril Shroff, whose daughter has married the son of Gautam Adani.

Wachtell has reportedly sought additional support for the Adani Group from crisis communication firms. As a law firm with expertise in repelling unwanted attacks from corporate raiders, Wachtell will concentrate on coordinating legal, regulatory, and public relations for the conglomerate.

On Friday, the decline in Adani group’s shares persisted as MSCI reduced the proportion of freely tradable shares it takes into account for four companies in its indices. The decision by MSCI was made after US short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report on January 24, accusing the Indian conglomerate of stock manipulation and improper utilization of offshore tax havens to conceal the extent of Adani family members’ ownership in the group’s companies. Despite the allegations, the Adani group has denied any misconduct.

Adani-Hindenburg saga

Gautam Adani, the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, one of the top 5 wealthiest people in the world before the report was published, saw his fortunes turn and wealth erode as nervous investors pulled money out by selling their holdings of the Adani Group stocks. Adani reportedly lost $100 bn in valuation following the allegations made by Hindenburg Research.

It all started last month after Hindenburg Research published a report accusing the Adani Group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Hinderburg, a short seller that relies on the trading strategy based on the expectation that the price of the security will fall, claimed that Gautam Adani, the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, has a net worth of approximately $120 billion, mainly due to an 819% average stock price growth in the group’s seven most significant publicly traded companies over the last three years. Predictably, the Adani share prices were pummelled in the days since the release of the report.

The grave allegations were contested promptly by the Adani Group, which trashed the Hindenburg Research report as a ‘malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations’. Days later, it released a 413-page rebuttal to the Hindenburg Research report.

However, the crisis was exacerbated by the Adani Group’s decision to call off an oversubscribed FPO in view of the serious allegations levelled against the group by Hindenburg Research. While the business conglomerate trashed the report as malicious disinformation and released a whopping 413-page statement to contest the claims made by Hindenburg, the attendant confusion, uncertainty, and anxiety among investors sent the group’s stocks into free fall and saw the chairman’s valuation plunge considerably.","According to the report, Wachtell was approached by the Adani conglomerate through the office of the Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas firm, which is spearheading the defence of Adani Group.

On February 14, several reports indicated that the Adani Group hired accounting firm Grant Thornton to conduct independent audits of several of its subsidiaries in an effort to refute charges made by short-seller Hindenburg Research that have hurt its stocks and bonds. Reports also mentioned that Grant Thornton would investigate whether related-party transactions at the Adani Group conformed with corporate governance rules.

A day earlier, on February 13, Adani Group, during a market crash following a short-seller report, declared that each of its portfolio firms’ balance sheets was very healthy, that it had good corporate governance, and that its assets were secure.

On the same day, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said that it was looking into the Hindenburg report as well as market behaviour before and after it was published.

Since the news of the study by US-based short-seller Hindenburg surfaced, the market value of Gautam Adani’s group has dropped by almost $120 billion. The Adani Group has refuted accusations of ‘brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud… over the course of decades’ and has since made an effort to reassure investors by highlighting a robust balance sheet in response to worries over an excessive amount of debt.

According to the reports, the Congress party has also approached SEBI and the Reserve Bank of India, demanding for a probe into how public financial institutions have been exposed to the crisis. According to the Group, it has safe assets, excellent cash flow, fully financed business plans, and is still confident in the continuing potential of its portfolio to produce exceptional returns to shareholders.

The controversy surrounding the Adani Group has also sparked political conflict in India, with opposition parties, such as the Congress, accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party of favouring Adani, who is from Gujarat, the home state of PM Narendra Modi.

The Supreme Court meanwhile has received several petitions calling for investigations into the different accusations, and it is scheduled to hear a number of them on Friday. To safeguard the interests of thousands of investors, the top court has already urged the government to establish a “robust framework” by modifying the legislation and enhancing the supervision provided by SEBI.","On Thursday, Adani enterprises issued a statement to the stock exchange confirming that it had not hired accountancy firm Grant Thornton for an independent audit of some of its companies.

Gautam Adani, the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, one of the top 5 wealthiest people in the world before the report was published, saw his fortunes turn and wealth erode as nervous investors pulled money out by selling their holdings of the Adani Group stocks.

The crisis was exacerbated by the Adani Group’s decision to call off an oversubscribed FPO in view of the serious allegations levelled against the group by Hindenburg Research. While the business conglomerate trashed the report as malicious disinformation and released a whopping 413-page statement to contest the claims made by Hindenburg, the attendant confusion, uncertainty, and anxiety among investors sent the group’s stocks into free fall.

The pathological hatred harboured by the left-leaning liberals in India, who abhor successful businessmen for their ability to generate wealth and provide employment which they never could with their hoary activism and communist principles, also contributed to the bloodbath that Adani Group stocks witnessed at the stock market.

In a matter of just 31 trading sessions, the shares of Adani Enterprises, one of the foremost Adani Group companies listed on the stock market, crashed 76 per cent from their all-time high. The stock, which hit an all-time high of Rs 4,189.55 on December 21, 2022, slipped to a 52-week low of Rs 1,017.10 last week, plummeting 75.72% from its peak. Taking into account the market cap of Rs 1.57 lakh crore for the Adani Group’s flagship, the firm lost over Rs 2.88 lakh crore in market cap from its record high. On December 21 last year, the market cap (at the close of trade) of the firm stood at Rs 4.45 lakh crore.

As Adani Group’s market cap was taking a beating on stock markets, with some estimates claiming the group lost over $100 bn in valuation, a raft of left-leaning ‘liberals’, evidently with little understanding of how bourses work, gleed over the losses suffered by the business conglomerate. They cited the lower-circuit hit by Adani Group shares to emphasise that the Hindenburg Research group’s allegations had some measure of truth to force a market correction on the stock markets.

But more importantly, they used the stock market crash of the Adani Group shares to undermine the Indian growth story witnessed under PM Modi’s government in the last nine years. They insisted that the Indian Growth Story is as hollow as the Adani Group shares that are now tanking after allegations of gross manipulation and accounting fraud claimed by Hindenburg. The idea was to politicise the stock market crisis and co-opt it to use as a stick to beat the Modi government and implicate wrongdoing on its part by highlighting the alleged close relationship between Adani and PM Modi.

Nevertheless, the Adani Group shares saw an impressive recovery this week, with two trading sessions seeing many of the Group’s shares touching upper circuit levels. The stocks of Adani Enterprises, the company that was at the receiving end of negative sentiments fostered by Hindenburg and paranoia stoked by the left-liberal cabal, touched a high of Rs 1,962.70 during Tuesday trading sessions and is currently hovering at Rs 1,803 levels (up by 14.69 per cent) at the time of writing this report.

Notwithstanding the remarkable recovery registered by Adani Enterprises on the bourses, it is worth examining some of the doomsday scenarios that usual suspects foreboded, which may have contributed to the decline in the share prices.

Many gloating over the Adani crisis quickly declared it as India’s Lehman Brothers moment, the culmination of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States that triggered a worldwide recession back in 2008. Of course, they did not elevate Adani Group to the extent of bringing about a global recession. They restricted their contention to the realm of Indian economic space, which they declared would suffer massively if Hindenburg’s allegations against Adani turned out correct.

But their characterisation of the Adani crisis being a trigger to cause the undoing of the Indian growth story speaks more to their pathological hatred for India and an implicit acceptance that India had charted an enviable growth story in the last few years than their genuine concerns for retail investors.

Why Adani’s fall would expose Adani and not be a harbinger of a Lehman Brothers-like

However, comparing the Adani crisis to the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers is like comparing apples to oranges. It is disingenuous of the gloaters to draw a parallel between the two issues even when they are starkly distinct. In fact, the rush to hyphenate the Adani crisis and Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy betray that liberals have no understanding of either of the issues.

For starters, Lehman Brothers was a financial institute, not a business conglomerate like the Adani Group. The Lehman Brothers crisis was a significant event in the 2008 global financial crisis. It was a bankruptcy filing by the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, which was one of the largest and most complex in U.S. history.

The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers triggered a chain reaction in the financial markets and led to a global credit crunch, as well as a drop in the stock markets around the world. The crisis highlighted the interconnectivity and vulnerability of the global financial system and led to significant government intervention in many countries, including the U.S. government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and other measures to stabilize the financial system and restore economic growth.

A financial institute, especially one that was as deeply embedded into the system as Lehman Brothers, incurs a greater risk of triggering cascading ramifications, including recession, through its involvement in financing disparate organisations and sectors—the crash of anyone could severely impact the organisation’s health and future viability.

By contrast, the Adani Group is a business conglomerate whose primary concern is to stay in business, meet its financial obligations, and provide value to its investors. Unlike a financial institute, the Adani Group’s fortunes depend on its actions and not on the performance of other organisations or sectors.

In addition to this, many state-owned financial institutions like the LIC, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and others have minuscule exposure to the investments or loans granted by them to the Adani Group. For instance, the SBI recently cleared apprehensions, stating that it has only 0.9 per cent exposure to Adani and has granted loans against shares but against cashflows. The largest lender also said that it is confident in Adani’s repayment of loans, adding that the group has a historical record of paying on time.

The underlying cause of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy was a combination of factors, including excessive risk-taking, leverage, and a lack of diversification in its investment portfolio. The bank was heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities, which suffered significant losses as the U.S. housing market declined and the subprime mortgage crisis deepened. As the value of these securities declined, Lehman Brothers’ balance sheet became increasingly strained, and it was unable to find the capital it needed to meet its financial obligations.

Additionally, the bank’s high levels of leverage, or borrowing, magnified its losses and made it difficult for it to survive the market turmoil. The combination of these factors ultimately led to Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and its impact on the global financial system.

While the Lehman Brothers’ collapse could be attributed to a deeper financial malaise plaguing the US financial sector, the allegations on the Adani Group do not reflect system-wide wrongdoing. If proven, the allegations would expose the malpractices espoused by the Adani Group, and the corresponding fall would only impact the business conglomerate.

Those using the Hindenburg Research report to paint gloom and doom and predict a Lehman Brothers-like scenario are unjustifiably resorting to alarmism and paranoia to push their political agenda.","Gautam Adani, the founder and chairman of the Adani Group, one of the top 5 wealthiest people in the world before the report was published, saw his fortunes turn and wealth erode as nervous investors pulled money out by selling their holdings of the Adani Group stocks.

Pronouncing the decision Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud said there is no question of gagging the media till the court pronounces the order. “We are not going to issue any injunction to the media ever. We will pronounce orders shortly,” the CJI said.

The apex court was responding to a plea filed by Adv ML Sharma on February 3. The plea had sought a gag order to prevent media from carrying statements or allegations related to the Adani group firms unless they are filed with and verified by market regulator SEBI.

“Media hype has crashed the Indian share market by more than 50 per cent. Regular allegations /statements in the media are creating panic amongst the investors who are selling their stock under panic and suffering financial losses. Common investors are being butchered which must be stopped in the interest of justice,” the interim plea said.

Adani-Hindenburg row: SC rejects centre’s sealed cover suggestions over expert panel

On Friday, February 17, the Supreme Court turned down the Centre’s suggestion in a ‘sealed cover’ regarding a proposed panel of experts recommending steps to tighten regulatory measures in order to minimise any loss to Indian investors due to market volatility, as witnessed during the Adani-Hindenburg row.

A bench comprising of the Chief Justice of India (CJI), DY Chandrachud, and Justices PS Narasimha and JB Pardiwala decided against accepting the government’s sealed cover proposal stating that since the issue demands ‘full transparency’, doing so may give the impression that the committee was appointed by the government and the matter was kept away from the other side.

Four petitions regarding a report written by short-seller Hindenburg Research, alleging conglomerate fraud that cost the Adani Group losses of over $100 billion in market value, were being heard by the court.

Notably, on Monday, the Centre agreed to the top court’s recommendation to form a panel of experts to look into strengthening the regulatory procedures for the stock market in the wake of the share price drop in the Adani Group stocks, which was precipitated by a report by Hindenburg Group over claims of “stock manipulation”. Nonetheless, the Adani group has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.","‘Not Going To Issue Any Injunction Ever Against Media’ : Supreme Court Rejects Plea To Gag Media From Reporting Adani-Hindenburg Issue #CJIDYChandrachud #SupremeCourt #Adani #Hindenburg https://t.co/5nWoxRXRPh — Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 24, 2023Pronouncing the decision Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud said there is no question of gagging the media till the court pronounces the order.

As per a report by Reuters, the accounting and advisory organisation has been hired to conduct an independent audit of some of the companies run by billionaire businessman Gautam Adani.

The development comes after the Hindenburg Research report and the subsequent media speculations over the Adani Group wiped out $120 billion market value from 7 listed subsidiaries of the Adani group. Citing sources, Reuters reported that Grant Thornton LLC will evaluate whether Adani Group complied with global corporate governance standards.

The report added that the accountancy organisation will also evaluate issues pertaining to internal controls, related party transactions and legal compliance. Meanwhile, on Monday (February 13), Adani Group assured its investors that it had strong cashflows and fully funded business plans.

Gautam Adani had also enlisted the services of Wachtell, a highly-priced legal firm in the United States, to defend against claims made by short-seller Hindenburg Research, a report published in Financial Times had said earlier.

According to the report, Wachtell was approached by the Adani conglomerate through the office of the Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas firm, which is spearheading the defence of Adani Group.

The regulator also stated that all necessary surveillance measures are in place to address any excessive volatility in individual shares, according to the news agency PTI.

In an official statement, the watchdog without naming the Adani Group specifically said that unusual price movement in the stocks of a business conglomerate has been observed in the past week.

Officials confirmed that the statement has been issued in the wake of the Adani matter only.

“As part of its mandate, Sebi seeks to maintain orderly and efficient functioning of the market and has put in place a set of well-defined, publicly available surveillance measures (including the ASM framework) to address excessive volatility in specific stocks. This mechanism gets automatically triggered under certain conditions of price volatility in any stock,"" SEBI said as quoted by PTI.

It further stated that in all specific entity-related matters, if any information comes to its notice, then, as per extant policies, the same is examined and after due examination, appropriate action is taken.

""Sebi has consistently followed this approach on entity-level issues and would continue to do so in the future as well,"" it added.

Stock exchanges BSE and NSE have put three Adani group companies -- Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, and Ambuja Cements -- under their short-term additional surveillance measure (ASM), which basically means that intra-day trading would require a 100 percent upfront margin and is aimed at curbing speculation and short-selling in these stocks.

Ackman is the same ‘financial expert’ who upheld the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani group, which wiped out 10 lakh crores worth of investor’s money from the Indian conglomerate in less than two weeks’ time.

He also did not shy away from casting aspersions on the integrity of the Adani group and fomenting turmoil in Indian markets. Jugeshinder ‘Robbie’ Singh ridiculed Bill Ackman for running to his ‘mommy’ to fix the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. “Kid wants ‘mamma’ to come help,” he said in a tweet (archive).

Screengrab of the tweet by Jugeshinder Robbie Singh

While Jugeshinder’s Twitter account is not verified on Twitter, he is followed by prominent Twitter users like ThePrint’s Shekhar Gupta and journalist Barkha Dutt amongst others.

The Background of the controversy

On Friday (March 10), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced the shutdown of the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the seizure of its assets.

Founded in 1983, Silicon Valley Bank operated out of Santa Clara in California and provided various services such as online banking, treasury management, and foreign exchange trade.

Following the development, Bill Ackman sought a bailout package for the commercial bank from the tax-funded US government. “If private capital can’t provide a solution, a highly dilutive gov’t preferred bailout should be considered,” he had demanded.

The billionaire investor further added, “The govt could also guarantee deposits in exchange for a dilutive warrant issuance and other covenants and protections. If SVB Financial Group is indeed solvent, this would buy time to enable SVB to restore the franchise and raise new private capital.”

Screengrab of the tweets by Bill Ackman

However, his reaction was starkly different when it came to the Adani group. In his response over the Hindenburg fiasco on January 27 this year, the billionaire investor had said, “Adani’s response to Hindenburg Research is the same as Herbalife’s response to our original 350-page presentation.”

“Herbalife remains a pyramid scheme. I found the Hindenburg report highly credible and extremely well-researched. Adani Group’s response speaks volumes. Caveat emptor,” Bill Ackman emphasised.

While he conceded that he did not undertake any ‘independent research’ and his judgment was based on the cursory reading of the Hindenburg Research report and Adani’s response, this gave an opportunity to the likes of Ravish Kumar to cast aspersions on the Indian conglomerate based on Ackman’s tweets.

The billionaire investor, in Adani’s case, did not seek a bailout package despite being aware of the short-term impact that the report of the US-based short-seller would have on the Indian economy and markets at large.

He also did not bother to keep his ‘innocent until proven guilty’ argument forward in Gautam Adani’s case, as he did in Sam Bankman Fried’s case. The sweeping statements of Bill Ackman were used by propagandists to suggest that the Indian conglomerate has been involved in wrongdoings.","On Saturday (March 11), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Adani Group, Jugeshinder ‘Robbie’ Singh, mocked billionaire investor Bill Ackman after the latter pleaded with the US government to bail out now-defunct Silicon Valley Bank.

OpIndia,,,https://www.opindia.com/2023/01/adani-group-hindenburg-report-short-selling-points-to-ponder/,,2023-01-31 08:26:56+00:00,"Adani, Hindenburg, short-selling and how it is all about Markets being at work: Salient aspects of the saga worth pondering over","I know I am wading into a topic that has been discussed enough in recent days. The Hindenburg report on the Adani Group has stirred a lot of interest. As Jinit Jain’s article has pointed out, the CONLEFT ecosystem’s attacks on Adani and their embrace of this report to use as a stick to beat Modi has split the right too – should they defend Adani or not? Let me ignore that for now and focus on other aspects.

We must understand and acknowledge that short sellers are very much a part of the overall free market ecosystem. They are often wrong and have their own profit motives – like any other player – but that doesn’t mean they can be condemned wholesale. They play a valuable role in unearthing fraud and bubble stocks. Many, like Jim Chanos, are highly respected even when they are wrong – as they have been with Tesla for a long long time. They may yet be proved right. There is a special breed of short sellers that are “activists” – they go around actively promoting their theories, perhaps hoping many will buy into it, dump the stock and help turn their doomsday prophecies into reality. At that point it hardly matters if the original allegations are right or wrong. Carson Block, Andrew Left are examples of such activist short sellers. Such activist short sellers usually target the big guys. Even if they are completely wrong and motivated, one must admire their guts. There are easier ways to make money, believe me. Adani is not the first or will be the last to be targeted by such people – they go for stocks with high PE, steep run-up in price and are led by visible and controversial people. After all, this is where they can find traction for their allegations and maximum profit potential – again this is not wrong. If posting crazily optimistic projections on Tesla (to name but one stock) while being long on the stock is kosher, so is posting doomsday on the same stock, hoping to profit on its decline. As long as there is proper disclosure, intelligent research or insights and the allegations survive the usual laws of defamation. The shorts pay a heavy price for their positions if they are wrong or if the market doesn’t believe them, whether they are activists or not. Many lost their shirts on “meme stocks” like AMC and folded up. Of course, they also made killings, as George Soros did with the Pound sterling. It is not just the right wing that attacks short sellers – everyone does, if it suits them. In fact, in woke liberal paradise of the USA, DOJ (which is supposedly independent) has opened a criminal investigation into short sellers and the FBI sent search warrants to many of them. Imagine Modi doing this! American politicians of various hues have harangued about the alleged damage “shorts” cause the economy while often playing the market themselves, including taking short positions! I personally think it is more harmful to ban shorts. Yes, they ‘distort’ as the famous academic Prof Mitts report alleges. They spend huge amounts of time and money to research and uncover frauds, not to speak of personal and financial risks for uncertain rewards. If you ban them, the incentive goes. Who will be the loser? The small investor who bought into tulip-style bubbles won’t have access to such analysis.

If all this sounds like a defence of short sellers, you are right! It very much is.

Now let us turn our attention to the specific case – Adani Group and Hindenburg. Again a few points are relevant:

Just as a disclosure, I don’t personally short any stock, I own them mostly for the long term. I do not own any Adani Group stock. I also have no investments in any hedge or other funds that are short-focused. Adani Group has been selected for the exact same reasons I mentioned earlier – its stock has run up quite a bit, deservedly or otherwise. But then the whole market is frothy not just in India, but in the USA too. And Adani is, to say the least, controversial perhaps next only to Musk. I am not trying to defend Gautam Adani – he is perfectly capable of doing it himself. I am more concerned about Indian infrastructure which needs more such investments given the pathetic state it was left to us when dynastic loot ended in Delhi.

Having said that I have some comments on the report:

In the very first paragraph, it says the accounting frauds and other manipulations are “decades” old. In that case, the CONLEFT ecosystem may find they have scored yet another self-goal. Pidis may well be careful, your lifafas and table scrap are at risk if this starts biting the hands that feed! India has signed special treaties that encourage routing investments through Mauritius etc. Obviously, Modi or Adani did not invent this loophole. In fact, in recent years the NDA government has with lots of effort, amended some treaties, tightened them – and in the process got attacked as anti-business. Having overseas subsidiaries and holding companies, especially in tax-attractive domains like Singapore, UAE etc., is not wrong in of itself – many do it. Not just Indian conglomerates. The challenges this presents to Income tax and other authorities is a separate problem that needs serious discussion but not one that focuses on any one entity. It is also common for companies that fund infra such as solar or other power plants to insist on separate legal entities and related ownership structures for each project. This is to avoid the problem from one affecting the other. It is hilarious to see the report pointing out close family control of the Group – this is how Corporate India (or for that matter Political India) runs! So-called key person risk etc. is well known and is hardly an Adani-specific problem. You don’t need a short seller to educate us on that! Adani is into infra–transmission, green energy, power, airports, ports etc. All of these have considerable time horizons, long gestation periods and huge capital expenditures. But that is also a blessing as it is not easy to get into. It is not a group that’s into dot-com, crypto, chain marketing etc that are scams or bubble almost at birth. All these businesses require funding from deep-pocketed institutional investors with a long-term view. These investors don’t read sell-side or hedge fund analyst reports to do due diligence. They have access to data, information and insights that we simply don’t. And they don’t recall loans or investments at short notice. Adani is not likely their first or only infra investment. The report’s prediction (or prayer?) of “one liquidity event” creating a cascading collapse seems farfetched. What the report doesn’t talk about is equally important – loans that are NOT from related parties. Are these fickle investors? Too much short-term loans used to fund long-term projects? No idea. Related party loans, over which the report spends a huge amount of time, are resilient to short-term mood changes even if they are routed through a complex web of entities for tax or other reasons. Even the attack over the current ratio, an odd metric to pick for a long-term infra group, seems half-hearted – “let’s throw this and see if it sticks”. There is no mention of what the ratio was a year ago or two years ago! Has it gotten worse or better? I guess if worse it would have found mention! A lot of the Adani group assets and entities are in advanced markets like Singapore, Australia which are regulated independent of SEBI, Modi or India. The entire market cap of Adani Group – even before the decline is US$218 billions. To see this in perspective, BSE market cap total is well over $3 trillions. The report itself argues that Adani controls far more of the group than he has declared – well over 75%. And it also says funds have largely avoided investing in it! If so, who exactly is the victim? Clearly, Adani has more skin in the game than most Indian lalas. In fact, many of them control their companies with far less holding and hence are not left holding the bag when things collapse. Even if the entire Adani Group collapses, it will leave India with infrastructure assets like ports that will have value in a booming economy. Buyers can be found. It is not an arms brokerage or land-flipping outfit that dynasties and their damaads are more familiar with. Much has been said about the “400-page” response by Adani as if that is a crime. In fact, only 50 pages are the real response – the rest are annexures mostly of public documents. Note that the Hindenburg report is quite long as well and repetitive. I do not agree that these attacks by Hindenburg constitute an “attack on India”. This line of defence will only hurt. It will be used to gloss over all the other deficiencies in the original analysis and the points made in the response. The corrupt media ecosystem has already picked on this as if that’s the only thing in the report. This is not market advise and I am no expert, but my gut feel is Adani Group will survive this saga.

But if the report leads to inventor education, curiosity about activist short sellers, better disclosure practices, stronger regulatory oversight and general cleansing of the system, it would have done far more good than harm.","Many, like Jim Chanos, are highly respected even when they are wrong – as they have been with Tesla for a long long time.

A SEBI press release said that the Indian financial market as represented by Sensex and Nifty has demonstrated ongoing stability and is continuing to function in a transparent, fair and efficient manner. SEBI said on a longer-term basis also, Indian markets have been viewed positively by investors.

A cross-country comparison of dollar-adjusted market returns with both peer and developed countries during the past three years till date places “the Indian Market as a positive outlier,” the regulatory body said.

“During the past week, unusual price movement in the stocks of a business conglomerate has been observed. As part of its mandate, SEBI seeks to maintain the orderly and efficient functioning of the market and has put in place a set of well-defined, publicly available surveillance measures (including the ASM framework) to address excessive volatility in specific stocks.

“This mechanism gets automatically triggered under certain conditions of price volatility in any stock,” the statement said.

SEBI said that in all specific entity-related matters, if any information comes to its notice, then it is examined as per policies and appropriate action is taken after due examination.

“SEBI has consistently followed this approach on entity-level issues and would continue to do so in future as well. SEBI is committed to ensuring market integrity and to ensuring that the markets continue to have the appropriate structural strength to function in an uninterrupted, transparent and efficient manner as has been the case so far,” the statement said.

Adani group stocks had witnessed a crash following the Hindenburg Research report.

Reserve Bank of India said on Friday that according to its current assessment, the banking sector remains resilient and stable.

The central bank had said it maintains a constant vigil on the sector and on individual banks with a view to maintaining financial stability.

Without naming the Adani Group, RBI said in a statement that there have been media reports expressing concern about the exposures of Indian banks to a business conglomerate.

“As per the RBI’s current assessment, the banking sector remains resilient and stable. Various parameters relating to capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, provision coverage and profitability are healthy. Banks are also in compliance with the Large Exposure Framework (LEF) guidelines issued by the RBI,” the statement said.

The central bank said it remains vigilant and continues to monitor the stability of the Indian banking sector.

State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Khara had said the bank’s total exposure amounting to Rs 27,000 crore in Adani Group is 0.88 per cent of its loan book.

“We have lent to Adani (group) for projects having tangible assets and adequate cash. They have met obligations…our total exposure to Adani group is 0.88 per cent as of December 31,” he said at a press conference.

Khara added those loans were against assets or businesses that are cash-generating, and the bank does not see any challenge. “There’s no cause for concern for us,” he added.

Opposition parties forced adjournments in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha over the Hindenburg-Adani group row on Thursday and Friday.

They have sought discussion over investment by LIC, Public Sector Banks, and financial institutions “in companies losing market value, endangering the savings of crores of Indians” following a report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research which has made allegations against some companies of Adani group.

The investment research firm claimed that Adani Group was involved in a “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.”

Hindenburg Research claimed that it has conducted an investigation on the company for the last two years and that it has documents to prove its claims. Hindenburg Research Report accused Adani family members of creating and managing “a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities” in tax havens like Mauritius, Cyprus, and the UAE. The report claimed that some of these entities were used for market manipulation.

It said Gautam Adani has a net worth of approximately $120 billion, mainly due to an 819% average stock price growth in the group’s seven most significant publicly traded companies over the last three years.

On Friday (January 27), Congress leader Jairam Ramesh launched a tirade against the Adani Group. “Hindenburg has put out a damning report on the Adani group which has reacted predictably”, he tweeted.

However, Congress has been supporting the Adani Group for a long time. The Indian conglomerate has obtained several projects in Rajasthan, under the governance of Congress Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. The conglomerate has outlined plans to invest Rs. 65,000 crores in Rajasthan over the next 5-7 years.

These projects consist of the development of a 10,000 MW solar power capacity, the expansion of a cement plant, and the upgrading of the Jaipur airport. Furthermore, according to an RTI, Adani Group and Reliance Industries jointly committed the largest investment under the ‘Invest Rajasthan’ program.

The companies pledged over Rs 1.68 lakh crore between December 2021 and March 2022 through Letters of Intent and Memoranda of Understanding with the government.

Adani Group had started the Mundra port in Gujarat after it was given wasteland during the Congress-backed Chimanbhai Patel government in 1993. The company had got more land during the Congress government headed by Shankersinh Vaghela in 1997. Subsequently, BJP governments under Keshubhai Patel in 1999 and Narendra Modi in 2005 gave the group more wasteland for expansion of the port.

Congress supported the Adani group in Maharashtra

During the tenure of the Maha Vikas Agadhi government, in which Congress was an alliance partner, the Adani Group was able to secure the Dighi port project in Maharashtra.

The company successfully purchased a 100% stake in Dighi Port Limited (DPL) for Rs. 705 crores with a plan to invest over Rs 10,000 crore to develop it as an alternative to Jawaharlal Nehru Port, the country’s largest container port.

UDF govt awarded new Vizhinjam port contract to the conglomerate

In 2015, the government of Kerala, led by Congress, awarded the contract to develop a new port at Vizhinjam to Adani Ports. The contract was given through the use of Viability Gap Funding (VGF), as Adani Ports had submitted the lowest grant of Rs 1,635 crore in the auction.

Despite signing a deal worth Rs 7,525 crore between Adani Group and the Kerala government, the project faced several obstacles. Upon completion, the Vizhinjam port is expected to become a significant competitor to the transhipment ports of Colombo, Singapore, and Dubai.

It will be the only transhipment hub in the Indian subcontinent, situated in a strategic location on the Indian coastline and close to international shipping routes. This location makes it a central hub for shipping in the region.

It should be noted that even during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) era, the Union government had awarded the Adani Group 10 projects worth Rs 21,000 crore.

Adani Group slams Hindenburg Research report

On Wednesday (January 25), the Adani Group trashed the Hindenburg Research report as a ‘malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations’.

The Group stocks lost Rs 46,000 crores in market cap after Hindenburg claimed that the Indian giant had participated in a clear stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over decades.

While the Congress party is now using the controversial report to indirectly take potshots at the BJP, it has been at the helm of supporting the very industrialist it had been accusing of crony capitalism.","The Congress party has attacked the Indian conglomerate Adani Group after US-based activist investor group Hindenburg Research published a 32,000-word report against it.

Caught between a row over the price of coal and this week’s crash in its share valuations and credit ratings, the Adani Power project planned as a major Indian infrastructure push to provide electricity to Bangladesh may be delayed by another six months, local reports said.

The project is one of a number in the neighbourhood — including those in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Myanmar — that have accompanied the Narendra Modi-led government’s “Neighbourhood First” initiative in the past few years. Highlighting the big-ticket announcements, Adani chairperson Gautam Adani has met with regional leaders, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in September 2022 and then-Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, while Adani family members have met with senior officials from Myanmar and even Indonesia.

However, with the group’s slide in fortunes and the cancellation of the Adani Enterprises FPO, governments in neighbouring countries are watching the company’s market situation closely, even as the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) made it clear that any setback to projects would not affect ties, emphasising that the Adani stock’s fall was “not a foreign policy issue”.

“If a certain project is not working for financial or economic reasons, I don’t think that’s a reflection on the relationship,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday.

Project delayed again

He was responding to questions about the controversy surrounding an Adani thermal power project in Jharkhand’s Godda, which was due to supply electricity for Bangladesh starting from January 2022, a deadline that has already been delayed twice.

According to the United News of Bangladesh’s report quoting government officials (which has not been denied), the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has written to Adani Power demanding that they reduce the price of coal to be purchased from Adani’s Carmichael Mines in Australia. Presently, Adani Power is reportedly billing Bangladesh $400 per metric tonne, far higher than the $250/MT rate that BPDB is paying at its other thermal plants.

The Adani Group did not respond to requests for a comment from The Hindu, but it is understood that unless BPDB sends a demand note for procuring the coal, the Godda project transmission will be delayed further. State officials quoted in a number of local reports say that the project’s prime lenders, State-owned Power Finance Corp. (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corp. (REC) would then have to sign off on the delay.

MIngling corporate-national interests

Other Adani projects in the region have also been in the limelight for various controversies, including in Myanmar, where the Adani group exited a $290 Yangon river port project in 2022 after the threat of U.S. sanctions.

In Sri Lanka, an uproar had followed the leak of a November 2021 letter from the Ceylon Electricity Board’s then-chairman M.M.C. Ferdinando to the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry asking them to allow an Adani proposal for a 500 MW wind energy project off the coast of Mannar, and to treat it as a “proposal from the Government of India to Sri Lanka”. When asked about this during a parliamentary committee meeting, Mr. Ferdinando, who later recanted his words, said that he had been summoned by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who told him that he was under “pressure” from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to okay the Adani proposal. Mr. Rajapaksa denied the allegation, and Mr. Ferdinando resigned in June 2022 after withdrawing his statement.

Officials told The Hindu that the government is watching developments in the wake of the latest trouble for the Adani Group, given that Sri Lanka, which is in the middle of a financial crisis, is hoping to see more infrastructure investment from India. Apart from renewable energy, the Adani Group has also begun construction on the $700 million Colombo port project for the West Container Terminal and officials said that they “are not concerned at the moment” as the funding for the port is on a “strong footing”.

‘Adani forays seen as push by India’

Meanwhile, officials in Nepal are also tracking developments in the Adani saga, given the group’s plans to lay transmission lines to connect hydropower projects in Nepal to a planned South Asian renewable energy grid. Such a grid would provide power from Nepal and Bhutan to India, Bangladesh, and possibly Sri Lanka in the future. After Nepal PM Sher Bahadur Deuba’s visit to Delhi last year, when he and Mr. Modi had issued a joint vision statement on energy cooperation, Adani Group officials had visited Nepal with a particular interest in hydropower projects in the Karnali Basin. However, they have not made any announcement yet, possibly given the recent change in government.

“Definitely people in Nepal are interested in the developments [around the Adani group] as the group is seen as close to the current Indian administration and their forays into Nepal were generally viewed as part of a push by the Indian establishment”, said Sujeev Shakya, a business consultant and founder-chair of the Nepal Economic Forum.

The Adani Group declined requests from The Hindu for a comment on the sustainability of project financing in the neighbourhood, especially given the current developments. In a region where energy and connectivity are in high demand, India’s neighbours will be particularly interested in how quickly the group can stabilise its position in order to procure funding for its projects.","The project is one of a number in the neighbourhood — including those in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Myanmar — that have accompanied the Narendra Modi-led government’s “Neighbourhood First” initiative in the past few years.

Ackman is the same ‘financial expert’ who upheld the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani group, which wiped out 10 lakh crores worth of investor’s money from the Indian conglomerate in less than two weeks’ time.

While he did not shy away from casting aspersions on the integrity of the Adani group and fomenting turmoil in Indian markets, the billionaire investor took a radically different approach when it came to the US market.

The failure of @SVB_Financial could destroy an important long-term driver of the economy as VC-backed companies rely on SVB for loans and holding their operating cash. If private capital can’t provide a solution, a highly dilutive gov’t preferred bailout should be considered. — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) March 10, 2023

In a tweet on Friday (March 10), Bill Ackman claimed, “The failure of SVB Financial Group could destroy an important long-term driver of the economy as VC-backed companies rely on SVB for loans and holding their operating cash.”

“If private capital can’t provide a solution, a highly dilutive gov’t preferred bailout should be considered,” he demanded despite being well aware that such a bailout package (if provided) will be funded by tax-payers.

The billionaire investor further added, “The govt could also guarantee deposits in exchange for a dilutive warrant issuance and other covenants and protections. If SVB Financial Group is indeed solvent, this would buy time to enable SVB to restore the franchise and raise new private capital.”

He tried to make a case for the defunct commercial bank by claiming that the bailout package would serve the interests of depositors and not the ‘poor’ management and equity holders.

Bill Ackman concluded, “The risk of failure and deposit losses here is that the next, least well-capitalized bank faces a run and fails and the dominoes continue to fall. That is why govt intervention should be considered.”

Earlier, the billionaire investor did not shy away from defending Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of ‘ponzi‘ cryptocurrency exchange FTX. He even claimed that Sam is ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and that ‘(we should not) sacrifice our core values in a rush to convict.’

Response during the Adani Crash

While Bill Ackman was seen batting for the now-arrested American entrepreneur and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) Financial Group, his reaction was starkly different when it came to the Indian conglomerate.

In his response over the fiasco on January 27 this year, the billionaire investor had said, “Adani’s response to Hindenburg Research is the same as Herbalife’s response to our original 350-page presentation.”

“Herbalife remains a pyramid scheme. I found the Hindenburg report highly credible and extremely well-researched. Adani Group’s response speaks volumes. Caveat emptor,” Bill Ackman emphasised.

Screengrab of the tweets by Bill Ackman

While he conceded that he did not undertake any ‘independent research’ and his judgment was based on the cursory reading of the Hindenburg Research report and Adani’s response, this gave an opportunity to the likes of Ravish Kumar to cast aspersions on the Indian conglomerate based on Ackman’s tweets.

The billionaire investor, in Adani’s case, did not seek a bailout package despite being aware of the short-term impact that the report of the US-based short-seller would have on the Indian economy and markets at large.

He also did not bother to keep his ‘innocent until proven guilty’ argument forward in Gautam Adani’s case, as he did in Sam Bankman Fried’s case. The sweeping statements of Bill Ackman were used by propagandists to suggest that the Indian conglomerate has been involved in wrongdoings.

The Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank

On Friday (March 10), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced the shutdown of the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the seizure of its assets.

The development was the result of the sudden shutdown of Silvergate Capital Corp and the unmindful fundraising of SVB, which created panic in the technology industry.

Founded in 1983, Silicon Valley Bank operated out of Santa Clara in California, and provided various services such as online banking, treasury management, and foreign exchange trade.

Reportedly, the crisis came to light on March 8 this year after SVB Financial Group (parent organisation of Silicon Valley Bank) announced a sale of $21 billion of its securities.

This was further worsened by the sale of company shares worth $2.25 billion to shore up its finances, prompted by high deposit outflows at the bank, caused by a downturn in the startup industry. As a result, the Silicon Valley Bank shares fell 60%, leading to a whopping loss of $80 billion.

To salvage the business, SVB CEO Greg Becker held a conference call with clients and venture capital investors, requesting them to “stay calm” to avoid further withdrawals.

However, it was to no avail. Many venture capitalists instead instructed portfolio companies to minimise their exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, withdraw their cash, and look for other lenders (thus further exacerbating the crisis).

In February this year, American business magazine Forbes placed SVB Financial Group in the 20th position in the list of ‘America’s Best Banks.’","Following the shutdown of the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) on Friday (March 10), billionaire investor Bill Ackman sought a bailout package for the commercial bank from the tax-funded US government.

""The department has also sent a proposal to CBIC (the department’s parent) to appeal against the Tribunal's order before the apex court. A legal view will be taken before moving the SC,"" said a government official privy to the development. These sources also pointed out that no fresh evidence can be submitted before the apex court and the appeal is only on points of law and fact.Other than the entities, the appeal also names three individuals including Vinod Shantilal Shah alias Vinod Shantilal Adani, court documents accessed by ET states. The appeal was filed on November 11 and the matter was further listed on December 16.“In May 2014, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (“DRI”) had issued SCN to APML and APRL alleging over-valuation.In August 2017, the Adjudicating authority of DRI i.e. the same authority who issued the SCN after dealing with in detail, set aside all the allegations and dropped the SCN. It has been held by the Adjudicating Authority that all the imports were genuine being undertaken at arm’s length and concluded that the value declared is correct and the value is not required to be re-determined (had dropped the SCN and had given a favourable order in the matter).On appeal by Customs Department, CESTAT, Mumbai in July 2022 dismissed the appeal filed by Customs Department and upheld the Order of Adjudicating Authority. The matter has not yet been listed for hearing,” spokesperson for Adani group told ETThe Hidenburg report that has hit Adani group stock had mentioned the DRI investigation. The total m-cap of the group has declined to Rs 10 lakh crore on February 3, 2023, from Rs 19.2 lakh crore as of January 24, 2023.Responding to the alleged involvement of Adani family members in instances of round-tripping of diamond consignments at grossly inflated values to and from India, the group in a press release slamming the report had said, ""Certain allegations concerning diamond exports have all been closed by the Customs Excise And Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) in our favour. This decision has been further confirmed by the Supreme Court itself twice over, a fact which has been deliberately ignored and concealed in the Hindenburg report (which contemptuously raises questions on the competence of the appellate tribunal with baseless claims that it has ignored evidence),"" the group said.In July 2021 – after minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the DRI is investigating certain entities belonging to the Adani Group – the conglomerate approached the CESTAT seeking early hearing on the matter, saying it had been getting enquiries from independent directors, auditors, financial institutions and lenders about the status of the case.In July 2022, the tribunal in its order observed that the department’s case pertaining to alleged over-valuation is based on certain documents received from the foreign branches of the Indian banks which were not certified as per the conditions prescribed under Section 138 C (4) of the Customs ActThe tribunal also observed that the investigation carried out by the DRI was ‘incomplete’. The tribunal opined that while the department submitted the documents received from the Indian banks, it failed to make the foreign banks join the probe. “...since the department could not interrogate or make Standard Chartered Bank join the investigation cannot be a reason to ignore the possibility of it acting as an active banker on behalf of EIF (the offshore entity) for the purpose of remitting the amount of original equipment manufacturer,” said the tribunal order. “The burden was on the department to prove why the total remittance amount was only through these two banks and no other bank. It, therefore, follows that the investigations carried out by the revenue was incomplete,” the order said.On March 15, 2014, the DRI sent a common show cause notice alleging that EIF, an entity based in Dubai, Adani Power Maharashtra Ltd (APML) and Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd (APRL) were related entities for the rweason that EIF was owned and controlled by Vinod Adani through EIH – the holding company of EIF – and that he was also a shareholder in Adani Enterprises Ltd , which in turn owned and controlled APML and APRL through its subsidiary Adani Power Limited.The show cause notice also alleged that APML, APRL, Electrogen Infra FZE (EIF) and other respondents conspired to siphon off foreign exchange abroad for the benefit of their related entities.The notice called upon the respondents to show cause as to why the declared value in respect of the goods imported by APML and APRL should not be rejected under Rule 12 of the Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007.According to the DRI’s case, “...in the guise of import of power sector machinery and equipment, APML and APRL, the two entities of Adani Enterprises Limited, appear to have indulged in over-valuation of impugned imported goods. The actual value of the imported goods is Rs 3187.61 crore, whereas the same have been invoiced at Rs 7161.73 crore, thus leading to an over-valuation Rs 3974.12 crore which appears to have been siphoned off abroad through EIF, an intermediary at UAE, which is controlled and managed by Vinod Adani, one of the promoters of Adani Enterprises Limited (flagship company of the Adani Group).” The Adani Group has repeatedly denied that Vinod Adani is a promoter of the group.However, the tribunal observed that when documents are not admissible in evidence, the department cannot seek re-determination of value on the basis of these documents.","""The department has also sent a proposal to CBIC (the department’s parent) to appeal against the Tribunal's order before the apex court.

The plea has also been filed with market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to conduct a probe against the short seller and its associates for “exploiting and duping lakhs of innocent investors”.

Advocate ML Sharma, who filed the PIL, said that he has sought a probe against the US-based short-selling firm and its founder Nathan Anderson.

Sharma said the petition has claimed that short-seller Hindenburg Research “deliberately” released the report against the Adani Group just before its Rs 20,000-crore follow-on public offer (FPO). The corporation needs to be investigated for causing investor loss and levied a penalty, Sharma said.

He demanded that the short seller compensate those investors who incurred heavy losses in the stock market in the last six sessions.

The shares of Adani Enterprises have crashed 76 per cent from their all-time high in December in just 31 trading sessions due to the scathing report, which accused the group of market manipulation and accounting fraud. The report said that the conglomerate is leading the “biggest con in corporate history”.

The stock, which touched its all-time peak of Rs 4,189.55 on December 21, 2022, slipped to a 52-week low of Rs 1,017.10 on Friday, February 3, falling 75.72 per cent from its peak. Adani Enterprises has lost over Rs 2.88 lakh crore in market cap. On December 21, 2022, the market cap (at the close of trade) of the firm stood at Rs 4.45 lakh crore.

Hindenburg Research in its report accused the conglomerate of “brazen stock manipulation, money laundering, and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades”. The short seller claimed that the report was summed up after a two-year investigation. Defending itself, the Adani Group called Hindenburg's report ""maliciously mischievous and unresearched"", which, it said, adversely affected the Adani Group, its shareholders, and investors.

In a 413-page response to the 106-page Hindenburg Research report, the ports-to-power conglomerate said: “This is not merely an unwarranted attack on any specific company but a calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity, and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India.”

“It is tremendously concerning that the statements of an entity sitting thousands of miles away, with no credibility or ethics has caused serious and unprecedented adverse impact on our investors,” the Adani Group added.","The Adani Enterprises issue reached the Supreme Court of India after a public interest litigation was filed seeking an investigation against US-based firm Hindenburg Research, whose report led to a massive plunge in the value of Adani Group shares in the stock market.

SBI’s exposure includes $200 million from its overseas units, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Dinesh Kumar Khara, chairman of SBI, said earlier on Thursday the Adani Group companies were servicing the loans and he doesn’t see an “immediate challenge"" to whatever the bank has lent so far.

The Reserve Bank of India, the nation’s banking regulator, had asked lenders for details of their exposure to the conglomerate following a rout in group companies’ stock prices, Bloomberg News reported earlier Thursday.

A representative for SBI didn’t respond to an email seeking comment on the exposure.

The exposure by various financiers to companies controlled by Gautam Adani has come under increasing scrutiny after their shares plunged following a scathing report from US-based Hindenburg Research. Wealth units of Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. have stopped accepting securities from the group as collateral for margin loans to their clients, Bloomberg News reported earlier.

Adani has repeatedly denied the allegations and called the report “bogus,"" and threatened legal action.

Other domestic banks are also confident the Indian group can service its loans.

State-run Punjab National Bank’s exposure to Adani companies was 70 billion rupees, Atul Goel, its chief executive, told reporters last month. About a third of it was to Adani’s airport business and cash-flows back the entire advances, Goel said.

Private sector IDFC First Bank Ltd. said in an exchange filing on Thursday that the funded outstanding exposure to the Adani Group was less than 0.1% of its total loans. Meanwhile, IndusInd Bank Ltd. with a loan book of 29 trillion rupees said its exposure to the conglomerate accounted for 0.5% of its loan book.

While the Budget and, to an extent, Economic Survey, did make a valiant attempt at taking over headlines, theirs was a short-lived time at the top.

As soon as the immediate analysis was done, media houses across India quickly returned to the sensational ongoing topple of the erstwhile third-richest man in the world, Gautam Adani.

And that is why Adani Enterprises and the continuing assault on it is ThePrint’s Newsmaker of the Week.

413 pages of drama

The week started with a bang. On 29 January, Adani Group released a 413-page response to the various allegations made against it by Hindenburg Research, a United States-based short selling firm. Adani came out with all guns blazing. In its reply, the group claimed to have answered all of the 88 questions Hindenburg posed in its original report that was released on 24 January.

Perhaps Adani Group also felt it could take advantage of the Right-wing social media cohort rallying around it. The company claimed that Hindenburg’s report was “a calculated attack on India” and also the independence, integrity, and quality of Indian institutions.

The fightback didn’t stop there. Adani Group went on to take aim at Hindenburg itself, saying it “has not published this report for any altruistic reasons but purely out of selfish motives and in flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws”.

Hindenburg’s scathing reply to Adani

Hindenburg was quick to respond, publishing its reply to Adani Group on the morning of 30 January. Right off the bat, Hindenburg took on Adani Group’s claims, which equated an attack on itself to an attack on India. “To be clear, we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future,” Hindenburg said, adding that they also “believe India’s future is being held back by Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation.”

We also believe that fraud is fraud, even when it’s perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, Hindenburg added in its reply. Clearly, this David was not going to take Goliath’s attacks lying down.

The short seller went on to say that “in terms of substance, Adani’s ‘413-page’ response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to our report.” Indeed, it is worth noting that, in Adani’s lengthy response, the annexures–containing background information on past court cases and judgments–began on page 55.

Hindenburg pointed out that although Adani Group claimed to have answered all of its questions, it had side-stepped the critical issue of Gautam Adani’s elder brother Vinod Adani, his alleged front companies and their alleged dealings with the Adani Group firms.

In what has come to become the hallmark of Hindenburg’s brutal style, it said: “In other words, we are expected to believe that Gautam Adani has no idea why his brother Vinod lent massive sums of money to Adani entities, and no idea where the money originated from.”

If any of that were true, Gautam could have easily cleared up the mystery by calling his brother, Hindenburg further asked in its scathing reply. “Or asking him [Vinod Adani] at the next family dinner, why he has been directing billions of dollars to Adani-controlled entities through a network of opaque offshore shell entities,” it added.

Beginning of turmoil

This was just Monday morning; the week was just beginning.

Throughout Monday and Tuesday, Adani Group managed to rally a fightback against the bears in the stock market, with the Adani Enterprises stock ending both days marginally higher. This recovery must have brought considerable relief for Gautam Adani, coming as it did after a wipeout of about Rs 4.17 lakh crore of value from Adani stocks the previous week.

This relief, however, was short-lived. On Wednesday–Budget day, incidentally–news emerged that Credit Suisse Group AG, a Swiss investment banking firm, had stopped accepting Adani Group bonds as collateral for margin loans given to its private banking clients. While it didn’t come right out to say it, this basically meant Credit Suisse no longer trusted the value of the bonds issued by Adani companies.

This move was followed by more international buzz on the issue. Media houses claimed that there were indications that the Adani Group had allegedly used various shady channels to invest funds in its own follow-on public offer (FPO), another potential sign of weakness and malfeasance.

What followed was the savage destruction of market value for Adani stocks. The Adani Enterprises stock ended the day’s trading session with a massive 28.45 per cent down. Then came the big and surprising news: Late Wednesday night, Adani Enterprises announced they were cancelling their Rs 20,000 crore FPO–the biggest that India had seen–to “protect investors”.

This announcement was unprecedented and embarrassing, and it’s probably not a coincidence that Adani released it at night, long after the stock markets had closed and after most news agencies had wound down for the day.

Take a breath, and drink some water; that was just Wednesday.

If a rising tide lifts all boats, a tsunami drowns them all. Those who could bail out did. On Thursday, news came in that Jo Johnson, brother of former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, had resigned as director on the board of Elara Capital, a UK-based company linked to the Adani Group and one that featured prominently in Hindenburg’s original report.

The same day, Citigroup’s wealth arm said that from 7 February onwards, it would also stop accepting securities of Adani companies as collateral for margin loans.

The blows didn’t stop there. The National Stock Exchange on Thursday announced that it was placing shares of Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, and Ambuja Cements (an Adani company) under additional surveillance. Internationally, the S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would be removing Adani Enterprises from its sustainability indices “following a media & stakeholder analysis triggered by allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud”.

Phew. That’s Thursday done. At the start of Friday, and at the time of writing, the stocks of Adani listed companies continued to plummet, having already lost $120 billion–or around half the Adani Group’s value–since the original Hindenburg report came out. Adani Enterprises’ stock recovered briefly through the day, but ended Friday’s trade down 2.2 per cent.

The week is done, and Gautam Adani must be grateful that stock markets are shut on weekends. But it’s a safe bet that this story still has a way to go. Indian regulators are yet to officially enter the fray.

These allegations will be investigated and thrown out in some time and confidence will be rebuilt. But in the meantime, Hindenburg gets away with it.”

He stated: “Till the time the market continues in this volatile condition, there is bound to be an erosion of confidence. It takes a lifetime to build a reputation and trust, and a moment to destroy it.”

On Thursday, Gautam Adani announced that the company board felt it was not morally right to go ahead with the Rs 20,000 crore FPO issue due to market volatility on Budget day. He added that the interest of investors is paramount and everything else follows thereafter.

He said, “After a fully subscribed FPO, the decision of its withdrawal would have surprised many. But considering the volatility of the market seen yesterday, the board strongly felt that it would not be morally correct to proceed with the FPO.”

During the course of this interview, Salve also took a jibe at the US-based short-selling firm and said some people like making money by leveling such allegations. He further noted that Gautam Adani’s grandchildren will fight the case if the Group sues Hindenburg for damages.

Salve said: “Where India lacks is that in India, we don’t have the legal framework to take on a Hindenburg. If we sue them for damages, Gautam Adani’s grandchildren will be fighting the case.”

Meanwhile, nine companies of the Adani Group have lost $107 billion in market cap after six straight sessions of a blood bath at Dalal Street or nearly 45 per cent.

This is half of what is allowed under rules, reported Bloomberg quoting a source.

SBI’s exposure includes $200 million from its overseas units, said the report. Dinesh Kumar Khara, chairman of SBI, said earlier on Thursday the tumult-hit Adani Group companies were servicing the loans and he doesn’t see an “immediate challenge” to whatever the bank has lent so far.

On Thursday, SBI's scrip on BSE was trading nearly flat at Rs 527.75.

Adani Group firms' stocks lost combined market capitalisation of over $100 billion in the past week due to a scathing report by US-based short seller firm Hindenburg Research.

Hindenburg Research said it holds short positions in Adani Group companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.

The seven listed companies of the Adani group have an 85% downside on a fundamental basis due to sky-high valuations, Hindenburg said in the report.

""Key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing,"" Hindenburg said.

Earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported that Reserve Bank of India has asked PSU banks for details of their exposure to the Adani Group of companies.

Information being sought by the RBI includes details of collateral being used to back loans and any indirect exposure banks may have, Reuters reported quoting sources.

“There is nothing alarming about Adani exposure and we don't have any concerns as of now,” Khara told Reuters last week, adding that Adani Group hasn't raised any recent funds from the bank.

The Indian banking sector's direct exposure to the Adani group was just 0.6%, Societe Generale said in a report on Wednesday. It said markets are ""overpricing"" the risk to Indian lenders of their exposure to the Adani Group and that a selloff in banking shares seemed overdone.

Adani group shares sank on Thursday after it abandoned its flagship company's $2.5-billion stock offering, swelling the conglomerate's market losses to more than $100 billion and sparking worries about the potential systemic impact.

Adani Enterprises plunged nearly 20% on Thursday, trading at its lowest since March 2022. Other group companies were also under pressure - Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone was down 5%, while Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission lost 10% each.

Nifty Bank index has lost 5.4% since the New York-based short-seller released its report.

Punjab National Bank has a total exposure of Rs 7,000 crore to Adani Group, but there is currently no worry pertaining to those accounts, the state-run lender's managing director and chief executive said on Monday.

""Out of Rs 7,000 crore, around Rs 2,500 crore is related to Adani's airport business,"" PNB CEO Atul Kumar Goel told reporters at a virtual press conference after the company's quarterly results.

""Whatever the exposure we are having is backed by cash flow.""

However, the bank is keeping a ""close eye"" on the developments pertaining to the news flow around Hindenburg's research report, Goel said.

This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in...",2023-02-04 02:45:14+00:00,Market has won & now it’s for Adani to decide whether he will lose or not,"This week’s National Interest isn’t about Gautam Adani. This is, instead, about Indian capitalism.

This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in our independent history. Or, more precisely, post-1991 history. Since the expansion, opening up and modernisation of Indian markets began in the summer of 1991, many crises have struck it periodically.

Among these were Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh, Fairgrowth and others. Each one held out a crippling threat to Indian markets and to the new equity culture among common Indians, which is so crucial to a new capitalism.

Each rocked Parliament, pauperised many well-meaning investors and sent some crooks to jail, if briefly. But there are five crucial differences between these and now:

• None of these crises arose when the Indian markets and economy were globally integrated.

• These were crises of domestic markets where domestic interventions, either by financial or regulatory institutions — or even a phone call from North Block — could make a difference. The latest one is playing out fully in global markets and, more importantly, international media.

• The old crises — check out the so-called KP-7 (KP for Ketan Parekh) for example — mostly concerned Indian companies doing the bulk of their business in India. This one is about India’s most globalised corporate.

• The earlier crises emerged here, and the whistleblowers or investigative journalists who exposed these were Indian. This one has been triggered by a very foreign and tiny financial institution.

• The fifth, and the most significant, difference from the standpoint of this column — is that those who’ve created this kerfuffle aren’t whistleblowers. Nor are they activist shareholders. They are coming at it purely for profit. They are short-sellers. They have a fully disclosed vested interest in bringing down the share price of a company they’re ‘investing’ in by short-selling its US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments. Who said you only make money in the stock markets when your share goes up?

Also Read: Prannoy and Radhika Roy and the world of news this week on

The reason we list this fifth difference as the most critical is simple. When foreigners invest in our companies, when our companies list overseas, when the world sings our praises, when FDI and FPI figures zoom, we celebrate. Do we, at the same time, have the nerve to take the downsides that come with it?

One, that we, our government, financial institutions or regulators can no longer influence or arm-twist this all-powerful entity called the ‘market’.

Two, the need to accept that even what looks like a bunch of young upstarts can look to make mega profits by taking down one of your biggest conglomerates in the market. Markets in good capitalism have no nationalist lens. If money has no colour, it also carries no passport. And those who play in the market love their money first. All national, political or ideological loyalties come after that.

It is for all these reasons that we call the ongoing crisis the greatest stress test for Indian capitalism yet. And as we conclude the first full week of the market action on this, we can acknowledge that so far, Indian capitalism has passed that test. In fact, with a score of almost 10 out of 10. Surprised?

Almost two weeks into the crisis, the Modi government hasn’t said a word about it. None of the regulatory institutions has intervened in the market in any manner whatsoever, least of all as if to help the Adani Group absorb the blow better.

The conglomerate has been left to its own devices. If at all, the NSE has done the usual — and prudent — thing of increasing margin payments to curb excessive speculation. This is fully the NSE’s mandate in a situation of heavy volatility.

While the conglomerate called it a foreign conspiracy to attack and damage India and its institutions, the government, the entire finance ministry establishment, regulators and the ruling party leadership have all kept mum. Never mind the flag.

If India’s most powerful political establishment in almost five decades responds to a situation like this as if it’s something that must only play out between a corporate and the market, it is the coming of age of Indian capitalism. It is as if ‘let the market take its course’ is the new ‘let the law take its own course’.

Think, on the contrary, what would have followed if the mighty Indian state had acted in the way it might have when our political economy was less evolved. Really bad ideas like the suspension of trading and the launch of investigations against the “greed, amoral, and what-have-you” short-sellers could’ve found currency.

Even the whiff of such a false step would’ve done enormous damage to India’s markets, the global trust on which a booming new economy rides, and indeed to our still very adolescent capitalism. And please don’t say this talk is nonsense, that no such thing would ever be possible. The scar of the retrospective Vodafone amendment on global trust in India is still to heal fully. We have to be grateful that such ideas aren’t floating around now.

Essential to the embrace of capitalism is the acceptance of the fact that losses are as much a part of business as profits. Nobody can pass a law mandating only profits in the markets.

That’s why mutual fund sellers keep repeating that statutory warning: Mutual fund/equity investments are subject to market risks. It’s also because these investments involve risk that governments tax capital gains on equities and equity mutual funds at lower-than-normal rates.

The lesson for common folk, therefore, is not to get irritated when that statutory caution is repeated in so many advertisements between overs during your T-20 live telecast. Losses are as much a part of the market as profits. Hindenburg has only underlined to us that you can also make profits from “losses” if you’re a short-seller with nerve — and information.

The reason the market, particularly one as large and spread out as India’s, is so powerful is that it can never be identified with any individual. Not one, not many, not even a cohort. Think of it as a mob of anonymous moneyed millions. There is safety in numbers. Which is further fortified by that one-line ideology that governs the market: I love my money.

People can follow this god or that, vote for one party and detest another, love one football or IPL franchise and hate another. But they will never let any of this affect their choices on the market.

The only thing that matters here is ‘my money’. Of course, I can make the wrong choices, but never because of my politics, religion or loyalties. This is what makes money the most secular god of all. Which in turn makes the market the most powerful monarch. At least in the world of capitalism.

If you are in the market — never mind whether as a corporate, conglomerate, broker, banker or even an ordinary day trader or investor — understand the fundamental law that applies: May you be ever so high, the market is above you.

In this round, the market has won. But it is still for Adani now to decide whether he has lost or not. Accepting defeat would mean continuing to fret and fight with the market, with money or other clout, finding shelter underneath the supposedly ulterior motives of the short-seller.

The other way would be to take the blow with humility, as a bad day in the market. Focus on the many good and bounteously cash-yielding businesses and assets more sharply, rebuild what just got broken, and hope that the market will love you again in the course of time. This would be good capitalism.

Prior to the start of the Parliament's session for the day, like-minded Opposition parties got together to discuss their plans.

Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh, in an interview with ANI, claimed that Adani's ""mountain of lies and fraud"" is disintegrating like a house of cards. Prime Minister Narendra Modi must address the matter, the AAP MP urged.

""Adani's mountain of lies and fraud is crumbling like a pack of cards. Crores of investors in the country are worried. Those who have invested in LIC, SBI because both of them have given loans worth crores of rupees,"" Singh said.

The AAP MP said that he had written to PM Modi requesting that the passport of Gautam Adani be confiscated. ""I have written to PM Modi, CBI and ED to confiscate Adani's passport, otherwise if he flees the country like other businessmen, what would the crores of people do?"" he said.

On this subject, a number of opposition lawmakers have sent notices to the relevant houses of parliament suspending business. But, shortly after the Session started, both Houses were postponed till 2 PM.

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut told ANI that, in both Houses of Parliament, Opposition parties would bring up the Hindenburg report and the Adani stock crash. Congress’ Manoj Tewari urged that a joint parliamentary committee look into the matter.

""We demand an investigation by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the issue. We will raise the demand inside the Parliament. If the government doesn't accept our demand, we will take appropriate steps. We'll demand that a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) should be constituted to go into the alleged aberrations. The question is not only about one promoter but about the efficacy of the entire regulatory system,"" Tewari said.

Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra earlier slammed Gautam Adani after the Adani Group chairman had announced that his company would cancel the ₹20,000 crore follow-on public offer (FPO), fully subscribed on January 31.

On February 1, in order to safeguard the interests of its investor community by returning the proceeds, the Adani Group stated that it chose to withdraw the FPO in light of the recent market volatility.

Shares of Adani Group fell further on February 2 as a result of the conglomerate cancelling a critical $2.5-billion stock sale due to market volatility, which increased its market losses to more than $100 billion and raised concerns about a possible systemic impact.

“Regulators are independent of the government and they are left to themselves to do what is appropriate so the market is well regulated,” the Finance Minister said while addressing a post-Budget 2023-24 conference in Mumbai on Saturday. “This is not the first time that some FPO (follow-on public offering) is taken back. How many times that has affected the image of the country?”

On Wednesday, Adani Enterprises decided not to go-ahead with its fully subscribed Follow-on Public Offer (FPO), with the Group chairman Gautam Adani stating on Thursday that it would not be “morally correct” to go ahead with the Rs 20,000-crore share in the current market condition.

A report by the New York-based short seller had on January 24, accused Adani Group of brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud among others.

The US-based firm, in its report, raised concerns about shares of Adani group companies having a possibility of declining from their current levels, owing to high valuations.

In response, Adani Group said Hindenburg’s report was not an attack on any specific company but a “calculated attack” on India, its growth story, and ambitions. It added the report was “nothing but a lie”.

In its rebuttal, Hinderburg said Adani has “stoked a nationalist narrative” that seeks to conflate the “meteoric rise and the wealth of its chairman, Gautam Adani, with the success of India itself.”

In today’s press conference in Mumbai addressing a query about Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)’s exposure to the Adani Group, the Union minister said, “LIC have themselves come on the issue about their exposure to the Company (Adani).”

The Finance Minister said the government wants to sustain the recovery which had kept India at a good level of growth.

“We want to sustain the recovery which had kept India at a good level of growth, which no country – except for one because it’s fuel rich – has managed to reach,” she said.

Sitharaman added, “…and the credit goes to the people of India for somehow absorbing all the little help the government has come up with, either in the form of relief or a policy between 2022 and today.” She added that this recovery momentum should not be lost.

The minister added, “It was an expressed desire of the Prime Minister that capital expenditure should be kept up and that is why it has reached Rs 10 lakh crore.”

On the purpose of her visit to the financial capital, the Union finance minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had highlighted that it would serve well if the finance ministry goes all over the country and explain what is the idea behind the Budget.

“For the past three to four years we have started a process that we go to places post-budget and discuss the budget with stakeholders. Take their suggestions etc and include those suggestions into the amendments of the Budget. This was the first such outreach in Mumbai after this Budget,” the finance minister said.

This was the first such outreach in Mumbai after this Budget,” the finance minister said.","['Https', 'Aniin.Com', 'Ani', 'Asian News International', ""Is South Asia'S Leading Multimedia News Agency.""]","['withdrawal', 'sitharaman', 'adani', 'perception', 'report', 'fpo', 'nirmala', 'group', 'india', 'impact', 'added', 'mumbai', 'recovery', 'minister', 'indias', 'finance', 'union', 'wont']"

He also added that Soros employs and invests in resources that shape the narrative, which is dangerous. Further, the Minister opined that people like Soros start questioning the democratic setup when the electoral outcomes are not according to their liking.

“People like him think an election is good if the person they want to see, wins and if the election throws up a different outcome then they will say it is a flawed democracy and the beauty is that all this is done under the pretence of advocacy of open society,” he added.

This is days after Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros accused PM Modi of crony capitalism and of being complicit in the supposed ‘misdealings’ of the Adani Group. On February 16, Soros claimed that PM Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies and that their fate is intertwined.

He made the contentious remarks at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany ahead of the Munich Security Conference. “Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but he failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards,” the American billionaire alleged.

He also claimed that the ‘shakedown’ caused to the Indian markets due to the Hindenburg Research report will result in ‘much needed institutional reforms’ and ‘democratic revival’. Soros also alleged that so-called anti-Muslim violence in India has spearheaded the ‘meteoric rise’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Yesterday, Union Minister Smriti Irani also held a press conference and slammed the controversial financier for claiming that the Adani Group dispute would significantly weaken Modi’s grip on India’s federal government.

“The man who broke the bank of England, a man who is designated as an economic war criminal has now pronounced his desire to break the Indian democracy. George Soros, who hedges bets against many countries has now declared his ill intentions in the democratic processes of India,” she said.

The Minister further stated that those whom Soros considers the pliable need to be aware that India has already thwarted imperialistic plans and will do so again. “In India, democracy has and will continue to triumph. These attempts to weaken Indian democracy will be addressed with the might of India led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” she added.

She also called Soros’ remark a declaration to destroy India’s democratic processes and reiterated that war was being mounted against India and PM Modi. EAM Dr S Jaishankar also said on February 18 that Soros had earlier accused India of planning to strip millions of Muslims of their citizenship. “This didn’t happen. It was a ridiculous accusation,” the Minister added.

Jaishankar reiterated that the global financier was dangerous as he invests in resources that shape the narrative. As reported earlier, George Soros is a Hungarian-American businessman and a self-proclaimed philanthropist who had vowed to ‘fight nationalists’ and conservative governments worldwide, which he often refers to as ‘authoritarian governments’. During the course of his life, if there is one thing George Soros has hated the most, it is India and its nationalist government led by Prime Minister Modi.

Through his Open Society Foundation, which started its operations in India first in 1999 by offering scholarships and fellowships to pursue studies and research at Indian institutions, Soros has made great strides in creating disorder within India. In the name of running philanthropic activities, the left-wing international organisation led by Soros has begun to spread its tentacles across the country through his active support to anti-India elements operating inside India.

In the last few decades, George Soros has time and again shown his desperation to wage war against the nationalist government in India through various networks funded by him comprising NGOs, media, intelligentsia, etc. In January 2020, he also committed $1 billion to start a global university to ‘fight nationalists’ and climate change, calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilization.

While speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Soros pledged to fund a university project to battle the erosion of civil society in a world increasingly ruled by ‘would-be and actual dictators’ and climate change. Soros also claimed back then that the ‘biggest and most frightening setback’ was in India, as he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of creating a Hindu nationalist state.

Recently, he made statements against PM Modi accusing him of crony capitalism and of being complicit in the supposed ‘misdealings’ of the Adani Group. This is after the US-based investment research firm Hindenburg Research published a 32,000-word report, accusing the Adani Group of stock manipulation and use of tax havens.

The Adani Group trashed the Hindenburg Research report as a “malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations”. On January 29, the Indian conglomerate slammed Hindenburg Research with a 413-page report, dismissing allegations levelled by the latter.","On Saturday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar slammed the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros for his accusations against PM Modi and said that he is an old, rich opinionated person and that he is dangerous.

Telegraph India,,Adani row: Journalist mentioned in Hindenburg report speaks up,https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/adani-row-journalist-mentioned-in-hindenburg-report-speaks-up/cid/1914774,"Adani is one of the largest private sector airport operators, the second-largest operator of coal mines after CIL (Coal India Ltd); it has mines in Indonesia...",None,Adani row: Journalist mentioned in Hindenburg report speaks up,"Paranjoy Guha Thakurta breaks his silence two-and-a-half years after a court in Ahmedabad issued a gag order asking him not to speak or write anything that may go against the interests of Adani Group

Guha Thakurta said he was not willing to hazard a guess on the future of the Adani conglomerate. He said his response to the questions posed by The Telegraph only stated facts.

Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, the journalist who found prominent mention in the Hindenburg Research report that triggered turmoil in the share prices of the Adani Group and cast international glare on Indian probity in corporate governance, breaks his silence two-and-a-half years after a court in Ahmedabad issued a gag order asking him not to speak or write anything that may go against the interests of the Adani Group.

“I do not want to commit contempt of court. I have only given you facts,” Guha Thakurta told this newspaper on Sunday. Excerpts from the conversation follow:

Q: What piqued your interest in the Adani conglomerate?

Guha Thakurta: I started writing about the Adani Group because I write about the corporate sector, the economy — my area of interest as a journalist is political economy…. I have been a journalist for 45 years and I am now 67 years old.

The rise of the Adani Group has been truly spectacular. Very few people had heard about the Adani Group even 20 years ago. Until 10 days ago, he was the world’s third richest man, Asia’s richest man. Now, he’s fallen off from that perch after the shares of his listed companies crashed. So, if the rise of the Adani Group has been spectacular, the fall has been even more spectacular. Very few of us, including myself, could ever have imagined, before the Hindenburg Research report came out on January 24, that the Adani Group would not continue to rise.

Q: What sets the Adani Group apart from many other Indian corporates?

Guha Thakurta: What is truly out of the ordinary is the manner in which the Adani Group exercises dominance over so many sectors and segments of the Indian economy. It is the largest commercial port operator in India. It operates a dozen ports along the west and east coast of India. Internationally, it has the Haifa Port in Israel, and Abbot Point in Australia.

Adani is one of the largest private sector airport operators, the second-largest operator of coal mines after CIL (Coal India Ltd); it has mines in Indonesia and in Australia. It is the single biggest importer of coal to India, the second-largest generator of electricity from coal after NTPC.... The Adani Group also used to be the biggest aggregator of cut and polished diamonds 15 years ago — it divested this interest to others, including Winsome Diamonds of Jatin Mehta, who is the father-in–law of Vinod Adani’s daughter (Vinod is Gautam Adani’s brother). Jatin Mehta is currently outside the country. Winsome Diamonds happens to be one of the largest non-performing assets.

Q: When did you first write about the Adani Group?

Guha Thakurta: My article in 2015 was by and large a compilation of materials that were already in the public domain. The first article that one may call exclusive appeared in April 2016 by when I was the editor of the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW).

I wrote several articles in the EPW, including on allegations of misuse of benefits by the cut-and-polished diamond business of the group, about the pricing of power. The last article I wrote for the EPW in June 2017 pertained to the changes in the rules concerning power projects in SEZs (special economic zones)....

It also talked about how the government — the ministry of finance and the ministry of commerce -- were processing an application for a refund of customs duties in excess of Rs 500 crore without first checking whether the duty had been paid. The matter reached Parliament.

Q: You stepped down from the EPW shortly after this?

Guha Thakurta: As you know, I resigned in July 2017 after the board of trustees of the EPW said I should not be writing articles in my name because that’s what my predecessors had done. I was told they were thinking of appointing a co-editor; that I had destroyed the ethos of a prestigious publication which is like an institution. I was told that I had done an act of grave impropriety by engaging the service of a lawyer pro bono to respond to a legal notice that was served to the publisher, printer, writer and the editor of the article. And finally, I was told to take the article down and not to leave the room until the article was pulled down. I called a colleague of mine, pulled down the article, got hold of a piece of paper and wrote out my resignation.

Q: But you continued to write on the Adani Group?

Guha Thakurta: The article taken down by the EPW was published by The Wire (the news portal). Several people came out in my support, including Professor Amartya Sen and renowned scholar Noam Chomsky. Afterwards, my articles on the Adani Group by and large appeared in other publications, notably NewsClick. I became a consultant with NewsClick in May 2018.

Q: Isn’t there a gag order against you?

Guha Thakurta: I am the only citizen of India against whom lawyers representing companies headed by Gautam Adani have instituted six defamation cases that are currently pending in the courts of law.

Two of the cases are before the first class judicial magistrate at Mundra in Gujarat, two in courts of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, one in Baran district in Rajasthan, and one in Delhi.

In September 2020, the courts in Ahmedabad issued a gag order on me, my co-author Abir Dasgupta and NewsClick headed by Prabir Purakayastha, that we cannot speak, say or write anything that goes against the interests of Gautam Adani and his conglomerate.

There was an article which was considered to be defamatory — the contents of the article were not challenged. The headline was deemed to be defamatory.... It was the last of the series of three articles.

The allegation against me, my colleagues and NewsClick was that we have lowered the esteem of the judiciary in the eyes of the public. The case is currently pending and I cannot say anything more on this.

Recently in the Rajasthan case, several of us appeared before the magistrate at the Grameen Nayalay in Baran district to provide bail bonds and sureties for the bail bonds.

The article which was pulled down by the EPW was challenged by the Adani Group, saying it was defamatory. Cases were moved against the entities that run The Wire, my co-authors and myself. It went to a civil court in Bhuj and to a criminal court in Mundra. But now both are in Mundra.

Q: Was there any attempt to arrest you, as mentioned in the Hindenburg report? Were you jailed?

Guha Thakurta: In January 2021, while the pandemic was on, a non-bailable warrant of arrest was issued against me by a first-class judicial magistrate in Mundra. My lawyer argued that this non-bailable warrant was bad in law. He referred to the judgments of the Supreme Court where it was written that if a person fails to appear in court, you can issue a bailable warrant. If that person still does not appear, the court can issue a non-bailable warrant. This case relates to the article pulled down from the EPW and published by The Wire later.

In May 2019, before the results of the Lok Sabha elections were announced, the Adani Group withdrew the cases against everybody — The Wire, my three co-authors but I am the only person against whom the case continues. To answer your question, I was never arrested.

Q: Did you collaborate with Hindenburg Research?

Guha Thakurta: I never heard of it before the report came out. However, the report, which consists of 32,000 words, if printed as a book, can run into 150 pages. It makes several references to the work done by me and independent journalists like Abir Dasgupta who I collaborated with. But they must have accessed the materials which are in the public domain.

Q: Do you feel vindicated today after the Hindenburg Research report came out?

Guha Thakurta: Yes, I do.

Q: Have you met Gautam Adani?

Guha Thakurta: I met Gautam Adani on two occasions — May 2017 in Mumbai, and then in February 2021.

I had a long telephone conversation with him very recently.

But on each of these occasions, I met him on conditions that it would be off the record. I did not record those conversations. During each of the conversations, except for the telephone call, there were people with me.

A former colleague was with me in 2017 and in 2021, there were five of us in the room, including Gautam Adani and my wife. The first meeting lasted for about an hour while the second one lasted one hour and 55 minutes, to be precise.

The phone call lasted about 15 minutes.

Q: Did you initiate the interaction?

Guha Thakurta: The first meeting took place at my behest. The second one was by my lawyer Anand Yagnik who arranged it with the expectation that an out-of-court settlement could be arrived at. But that did not happen. The last phone call was a request from me to withdraw the cases.

Q: What was his response?

Guha Thakurta: He was non-committal. The cases are still pending as we speak.

Q: Since you have written a number of articles against top companies and conglomerates, have you faced court cases before?

Guha Thakurta: Many corporates have sent legal notices but nobody has actually taken me to court. Legal notices were sent by lawyers representing corporate entities headed by both the Ambani brothers. Subrata Roy of Sahara never took me to court either.

Q: These cases must have taken a toll on you?

Guha Thakurta: Yes, these cases do have an impact on me and my life. Takes up time and involves expenditure. But if you ask me if I would have done anything differently, I would say ‘no’.","Very few people had heard about the Adani Group even 20 years ago.

She alleged that Gautam Adani, the chairman of Adani Group, had misused the system to acquire many businesses. The government, Moitra said, should launch a thorough probe as the country's reputation and financial stability were at risk.

Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Motira said an investigation by the market regulator Sebi was ongoing but Adani Group put out a statement saying it had been exonerated by the highest court of the land. ""Which court? Which nation?"" she asked. The parliamentarian further said that Gautam Adani, in his response to charges by Hindenburg, said his brother had no formal designation in the group so any transactions with his brother and entities controlled by him not be disclosed as related transactions.

""Why has Sebi been the silent operator? Why would they permit a Rs 20,000 crore FPO without (submitting) an investigation report? Why didn't Sebi ask whether bankers had signed off on the valuation? How's Mr A's son's father-in-law allowed to be on the Sebi committee on insider trading and corporate governance? How?"" Moitra asked while firing a barrage of questions at the government.

""What about the DRI, what about customs? What about GST? What are they doing? This is the deception of the highest order,"" the TMC MP asked. Adani, she alleged, has been permitted to use LIC, SBI, and the PSU banks to get money as and when he liked. She said LIC already had Rs 36,000 crore exposure to the group and the SBI had an outstanding loan of Rs 27,000 crore. ""Why were they again anchor investors in FPO?"" she asked.

Last month, Adani Group launched Rs 20,000 crore FPO (Follow-on Public Offer). For the first few days, the response was tepid due to the adverse report by Hindenburg and the subsequent stock plunge. However, the issue was subscribed fully by the closing day. The next day, markets crashed further, wiping off significant money of new investors in just a day. Rocked by the market volatility, the conglomerate called off the FPO saying it would not be morally correct to go ahead with it.

Today, Moitra alleged that the government tweaked rules to favour Adani. ""Odisha's Dhamra LNG Terminal was not awarded by tender. And even if it is awarded by tender, rules are tweaked to favor him (Gautam Adani). For example, when he won six airport tenders, the Airport Authority of India delayed the handover for three airports. He invoked force majeure (unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract), and they accepted it.""

The TMP MP further alleged that the GVK was forced to sell its stake to the Adani Group. She said GVK built the Mumbai airport, and they did a fantastic job. ""On July 2, 2021, the CBI filed a case against the GVK group. On July 18, the ED raided GVK in Mumbai and Hyderabad. Then they sold 50.05 per cent to A's company,"" she said.

Moitra said Adani managed to use his proximity in the shipping ministry to prevent dredging in Mumbai ports for years. ""So the traffic in JNPT (Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust) can't grow."" She also alleged that GAIL and IOC were manipulated into signing a Rs 46,500 crore 20-year pay or use contract for him in Dhamra that he got without tender.

Concluding her discussion, the parliamentarian said that India was on its way to becoming the third-largest economy in the world. The government, she said, should immediately order a thorough probe into all matters as the country's reputation, system, and stability of the markets were at risk. ""Don't worry about infrastructure assets. We have world-class infrastructure companies that can easily take over his businesses,"" she said.","TMC MP Mahua Moitra on Tuesday slammed the government and regulators for not probing the allegations against the Adani Group by the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research.

On Tuesday, March 14, the Opposition raised the Adani issue in Parliament and demanded the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the Hindenburg-Adani report. As a result of massive sloganeering by Opposition MPs on the Adani stocks issue, Rajya Sabha was adjourned.

It is worth mentioning that the Supreme Court set up an expert committee on the issue arising from the Hindenburg Research report on Adani Group companies. The committee will consist of six members, headed by former apex court judge Justice AM Sapre. Sixteen parties reportedly participated in the opposition party leaders’ meeting chaired by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge in Parliament on Monday, March 13.

Indian National Congress; Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Samajwadi Party; Janata Dal (United); Aam Aadmi Party; Communist Party of India (Marxist); Kerala Congress; Nationalist Congress Party; Communist Party of India; Indian Union Muslim League; Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray); Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam; Rashtriya Janata Dal; Jharkhand Mukti Morcha; Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and the NC participated in the meeting.

'Microphones are switched off when we raise Adani issue', alleges Congress chief

On Monday, March 13, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that microphones are switched off whenever the opposition raised the Adani issue in the Parliament.

“There is no rule of law and democracy under Modi rule. They are running the country like a dictatorship, and then they talk about democracy,” Kharge alleged, adding that Opposition are demanding the constitution of JPC on the Adani stocks issue.

Adani Vs Hindenburg

After the Adani Group called off its fully subscribed FPO on February 1, the Hindenburg Research's report alleged the businessman Gautam Adani-led group was in stock price manipulation and accounting fraud, among others. However, the Adani Group maintained that the accusations made against it were to malign the company's image in public.

Terming the allegations 'malicious', the group reportedly hired a leading defence law firm Wachtell in its battle against Hindenburg Research. The Adani Group also consulted senior lawyers at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, to advise it on how to stem the crisis.","As the second leg of the Budget session of the Parliament has resumed, 18 opposition party leaders will hold a meeting to discuss the next strategy to corner the central government on the Adani-Hindenburg matter on Wednesday, March 15 at 10 am.

Under the bid, worth Rs 5,400 crore, the Adani Group was supposed to supply around 7.5 million smart meters to the power distribution company.

In a notification dated February 4, the state discom said: “The tender has been cancelled due to unavoidable reasons.” The notification added that UP discoms, such as Madhyanchal, Dakshinanchal, Purvanchal, and Paschimanchal, had floated tenders for the supply of more than 25 million smart meters. The combined value of the whole project was Rs 25,000 crore.

MVVNL had invited the e-tender for the appointment of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) service provider for smart prepaid metering in MVVNL.

The Adani Group had submitted the lowest bid of Rs 10,000 per smart meter. But MVVNL officials termed it as very high, following which the discom cancelled the tender citing “unavoidable reasons”, the discom notification said. The MVVNL has now allowed all the companies to re-bid into the process.

Besides Adani Group, GMR, L&T, and Intellismart Infra had submitted their tenders for the project. It is interesting to note that none of these companies are manufacturers of smart meters. After winning the bid, the companies would probably engage smaller manufacturers to produce the smart meters.

Now, the discom is likely to opt for a fresh tendering process. There is a possibility that other UP discoms involved could tread a similar line after MVVNL’s step.

Meanwhile, the UP power consumers’ forum had already challenged the bids before the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC).

Under the standing billing guideline of the Rural Electrification Corporation, the price of the meters had been fixed at Rs 6,000 per unit.","Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (MVVNL), Uttar Pradesh's power utility, has cancelled its order to Adani Group to supply smart meters to the electricity distribution company (DISCOM).

Ltd. is an offshore company that is a major shareholder in Adani Power, the energy firm at the heart of Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's business empire, reported Wall Street Journal.



In its most recent quarterly report, Adani Power portrayed Opal as an independent stakeholder with no ties to the ports-to-power complex other than its 4.69% ownership in Adani Power.



According to corporate filings obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Opal was formed on the island country of Mauritius by Trustlink International Ltd., a financial-services firm with ties to the Adani family.



As per the Mauritius filings, one of Trustlink's directors, Louis Ricardo Caillou, is on the board of Opal. Caillou is also named as a board member of another Mauritius-based firm, Krunal Trade & Investment Pvt. Ltd., with Adani's older brother, Vinod Adani, and Subir Mittra, the CEO of the Adani family office.



According to the documents, Trustlink International, another Mauritius-based company, serves as both companies' secretaries.



The central issue raised by claims made by American short-seller Hindenburg Research is whether Adani executives or family members have any control over decisions made by businesses like Opal.



Last week, Hindenburg published a 104-page study accusing the Adani Group of many frauds, including the establishment of phoney firms to artificially raise stock prices and violate India's shareholding laws.



The ports-to-power conglomerate has refuted the allegations, claiming that the stock manipulation claim made by short-sellers has ""no basis"" and is the result of a misunderstanding of Indian legislation.



Uday Kotak, an industrialist and banker, stated earlier today that he does not believe current developments pose a systemic risk to the Indian financial system. The large Indian corporations, he claimed, are more dependent on international sources for debt and equity financing.



After being fully subscribed on January 31, Adani Enterprises Ltd. opted to withdraw its FPO worth Rs 20,000 crore on Wednesday.

""The company seems to have sufficient liquidity buffer with cash and bank balances,"" it added.

""The stock is currently trading at FY24F PE of 17x which is at the lower end of historical range of 17-24 times.

It can’t be dismissed as ‘suspect’,"Nearly 4,000 years ago, King Hammurabi of Babylon established Law 229, which said that if a builder builds a house and it collapses, causing the death of the resident, then the builder shall also be put to death. Hammurabi posted his set of laws in a public square for every literate person to read, and believed this law was necessary to ensure high-quality construction in his empire. Author Nassim Nicholas Taleb cites this nugget of history to explain his philosophy of ‘skin in the game’, an ethical principle of symmetric incentives. It is a seemingly simple but intuitively hard-to-grasp idea of an equal share of risks and rewards for all stakeholders in a transaction.

The ongoing Hindenburg – Adani saga can be viewed through this prism to explain some of the confusion and scepticism ascribed to Hindenburg’s motives.

Hindenburg Research, a US-based short-seller, published a voluminous research report that cast severe aspersions on the Adani Group’s operations and claimed in a shrill manner that Adani was the ‘biggest con’ in corporate history. But they didn’t stop there; they also revealed that they had placed a ‘big bet’ against the shares of Adani Group, and stand to gain if the shares drop in value. And the implied corollary, that they would lose all their money if they were proven wrong and the shares did not fall. In essence, Hindenburg put their money where their keyboard was.

Senior political leaders, public commentators and even economics professors in ivy league universities have questioned Hindenburg’s motives and argued that the report is just a facade to drive the price down and gain profits. They argue that Hindenburg published a fallacious and exaggerated report because the short seller made a bet against Adani shares and is not indulging in some act of investor protection. So, was Hindenburg’s revelation of its ability to profit from the report a case of ‘skin in the game’ or skewed motive?

How Hindenburg shook Adani

Let us suppose that a pure research entity or a media publication released the exact same findings. Their veracity would have still been questioned and, perhaps, dismissed even more quickly as a vested shoot-and-scoot operation, because these were mere agencies with nothing to lose but something to gain from the report. In fact, there have been several reports by research shops, or media stories in the past, that have highlighted some of the very same issues that Hindenburg has raised about the Adani group. Those were waved away nonchalantly, either through intimidation with the threat of a lawsuit, or labelling them as ‘easily motivated operations.’

Hindenburg’s transparent disclosure that it stands to gain financially if its report was taken seriously, or lose if it wasn’t, created symmetric incentives that established the credibility of the report. It was a signal to the market that they believed so strongly in the quality of their research that other Adani shareholders would be convinced to sell their positions, and hence, the stock price would fall. In Talebian terms, Hindenburg had ‘skin in the game’ in this transaction.

Hindenburg could have chosen one of many options in this case:

1: Publish a report without betting against the share price

2: Bet against the share price without publishing a report

3: Publish a report, take a bet but do not disclose their short bet against Adani shares

4: Publish the report, bet against the shares and be transparent.

Options three and four satisfy the ‘skin in the game’ condition, but option four also signals to the rest of the market about Hindenburg’s ‘skin in the game’, which was the option it chose.

Hindenburg’s report not ‘suspect’

To be sure, I am not for a moment arguing that markets are perfect and cannot be manipulated by mischievous reports. If any, I believe markets are more often imperfect than perfect. But to argue that Hindenburg’s motive is suspect because it stood to profit misses the entire notion of symmetric incentives because it also stood to lose its money if the market did not believe its report. Adani Group had the opportunity to disprove and discredit the report and cause a lot of financial ruin to Hindenburg. The fact that they failed to only reaffirms the veracity of Hindenburg’s findings, at least before the market.

It is common practice in the world of finance for investors to buy shares of a certain company and subsequently talk up that company in public to let the world know, so that they can benefit from a rise in its share price. This is an accepted norm, and it is left to the markets to either believe or disbelieve the greatness of that company. No one questions the motives behind this established practice. But even erudite people seem to struggle to accept the flip side of the same practice—to talk down a company in public and bet against its shares.

The idea that one can profit from a fall in the share price seems to be far more challenging to comprehend and accept for most people than the idea of profiting from a rise in the share price. This asymmetry of the human mind has been researched and documented in great detail by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman and Israeli mathematical psychologist Amos Tversky, who called it “loss aversion”. Ethical philosophers may justifiably argue that it is worse to profit from someone else’s misfortune than from their fortune; hence, the two cannot be equated. But that is beyond the scope of this discussion.

Betting against a share or ‘short sell’ establishes symmetric incentives that are more credible. It is naïve and fallacious to argue that a ‘short sale’ induces perverse incentives, but a ‘long sale’ does not. The fact that Hindenburg could lose money if its report was wrong or rebutted easily, was actually the biggest signal of its credibility. Arguably, the exacerbated problem of ‘fake news’ in the modern world is, at its core, a problem of asymmetric incentives, where there is no punishment but ample reward and encouragement for false reportage in the guise of free speech. Establishing symmetric incentives, like in the Hindenburg example, can be a solution to stem the fake news malaise in society. But in this specific case, Hindenburg’s ‘skin in the game’ act removed Gautam Adani’s skin, metaphorically.

(Edited by Zoya Bhatti)","The ongoing Hindenburg – Adani saga can be viewed through this prism to explain some of the confusion and scepticism ascribed to Hindenburg’s motives.
So, was Hindenburg’s revelation of its ability to profit from the report a case of ‘skin in the game’ or skewed motive?
Options three and four satisfy the ‘skin in the game’ condition, but option four also signals to the rest of the market about Hindenburg’s ‘skin in the game’, which was the option it chose.

Prospective candidates have been ruffled by the fraud and stock manipulation allegations made by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research that triggered a $100 billion sell-off in Adani stocks and forced the group to pull the ₹20,000 crore follow-on public offering (FPO) of Adani Enterprises Ltd.

The diversified conglomerate runs businesses ranging from green energy to airports and ports and is a large recruiter.

“During our meetings with the client firms, we were told that it is business as usual and there has been no impact on the ground. We are conveying the same to the candidates who are in the crore-plus salary bracket,"" said the head of an executive search firm.

However, Adani group said there is no impact on “senior-level hiring"".

“All our ongoing projects continue according to the plan. Adani Group’s core fundamentals remain unchanged, and our robust systems, which are focused on creating a healthy work ecosystem, ensured that there is no impact on any senior-level hiring,"" a spokesperson for Adani group said in response to Mint’s queries.

Recruiters said while the senior candidates are on the edge, there is no impact so far on the junior and middle order.

“Valuation of companies and trading prices do not have any impact on hiring mandates. These are very early days still, and the group, which has companies across businesses including solar power, has manpower needs which span over many years,"" said Lohit Bhatia, president of workforce management at Quess Corp.

Bhatia said that unless cash flows get impacted, it will be business as usual for the group and its hiring targets.

The outlook of some Adani group companies were downgraded to negative by S&P Global Ratings on Friday. Although lenders and the Reserve Bank of India allayed fears of any stress on banks’ books because of the Adani stock rout, India’s top three state-run banks—State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Bank of Baroda—have an aggregate exposure of around ₹40,000 crore to various entities of the Adani group.

“The Adani Group also relies heavily on its internal hiring team, and right now, if there is an impact on hiring, it is because of the sentiments and market perception,"" said another senior headhunter of a Mumbai-based search firm, seeking anonymity.

On Monday, promoter Gautam Adani prepaid $1.11 billion in loans ahead of maturity and release pledged shares in Adani Transmission Ltd, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd and Adani Green Energy Ltd. The move is aimed at restoring investor confidence and easing the selling pressure in group stocks.

The promoter’s early payment will result in the release of 168.27 million shares of Adani Ports, 11.77 million shares of Adani Transmission, and 27.56 million shares of Adani Green, according to a statement issued by the group on Monday.","However, Adani group said there is no impact on “senior-level hiring"".

Advocate Vishal Tiwari, who has filed the petition, mentioned the matter for urgent listing before a bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud on Thursday.

Tiwari told the bench, also comprising Justices P S Narasimha and J B Pardiwala, that a separate plea filed on the issue is scheduled to be listed for hearing on February 10.

""A similar petition is coming up tomorrow,"" he said, adding, ""This pertains to the Hindenburg Research report which has tarnished the image of the country and caused loss."" He urged the bench that his plea be also heard on Friday along with the separate plea.

""All right. Tag it,"" the CJI said.

In his public interest litigation (PIL), Tiwari has also sought directions to set up a special committee to oversee the sanction policy for loans of over Rs 500 crore given to big corporates.

Last week, another PIL was filed in the apex court by advocate M L Sharma seeking prosecution of short seller Nathan Anderson of US-based firm Hindenburg Research and his associates in India and the US for allegedly exploiting innocent investors and the ""artificial crashing"" of Adani Group's stock value in the market.

The Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate.

The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

In his plea, Tiwari has said the petition depicts the ""drastic condition and fate of people"" when there is a situation of share fall in the securities market due to various reasons.

""Lots of people, who had their whole lifetime saving in such stocks, get a maximum setback due to fall in such shares with a huge amount of money going into the drain,"" the PIL submitted.

""In the aftermath of an unprecedented attack on billionaire Gautam Adani's vast empire by Hindenburg, the market value of all 10 Adani stocks have halved with investors sitting with a colossal loss...,"" the plea filed by Tiwari submitted.

It claimed that no concrete steps have been taken by authorities on the issue despite a ""massive attack being perpetrated"" on the country's economy.

""It is ultimately the public money for which the respondents (Centre and others) are answerable and there needs to be strict concern for mitigating of such loans with a clear process and sanction policy for such high stake loan amount,"" it said.

The Congress, after the Bharat Jodo Yatra, is attempting to use the Adani row as a plank to build Opposition unity and secure a leading space within the Opposition. Tamil Nadu's DMK and Telangana's Bhartiya Rashtra Samiti (BRS) have extended their support to the Congress. But the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Janata Dal (Secular) have kept away.

The Adani row also caused an uproar in Parliament on Friday. Opposition parties say they demand an investigation into the operations of the Adani Group because of how it affects SBI and LIC, both public sector lenders whose coffers are drawn from the savings of the middle class.

The opposition is arguing that the investment of the Adani Group in public sector banks such as the SBI and LIC has had a big impact on the savings of the middle class.

One of Congress's leaders, while protesting, said, ""The statements by the finance minister are false. When Hindenburg reported that the Adani group had confiscated statements and records, he had dropped to the 40th richest position. We are exercising our right to question and know why we have been cheated. The government is trying to save their close friend, but we will stand by the people. We will continue until the committee is formed to probe.""

To escalate the situation, the speaker of the Lok Sabha, Om Birla, said, ""You can question, and all the ministers are ready to answer. Staging a protest and adjourning the house is not a systematic way to seek answers. All your issues will be resolved. We are ready to debate, but you are not ready to discuss but rather protest. This is inappropriate. The people did not elect you to raise slogans. Being the old party, you must not adopt these methods."" Following the protest the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the whole day.

Earlier today, the Communist Party of India (CPI) MP Binoy Viswam gave a suspension of business notice in the Rajya Sabha under rule 267, demanding a discussion on the Adani groups’ crisis.","On Monday, the grand old party staged demonstrations in Hyderabad, Chennai, and Bengaluru.

The BJP Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) also stated that China is feeling overshadowed by India's meteoric rise.

""So one can suspect this could be the third element where the Chinese have meddled. Except that Hindenburg is known to be a bare operator and it picks these targets.

MSCI on Thursday evening said it had cut its determined free float for four companies in the Adani Group: Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC. Free float measures for four other companies in the group remained the same.

The cuts, which will come into force at the end of February, will result in smaller weightings for those stocks in MSCI’s closely watched indices, triggering outflows as investors who track the benchmarks reduce their shareholdings.

On Wednesday, MSCI said “certain investors” in Adani Group “should no longer be designated as free float pursuant to our methodology” after receiving feedback from “a range of market participants”.

MSCI defines the free float of a company’s shares as the proportion available for purchase in public markets by international investors.

Indian tycoon Gautam Adani’s sprawling airports-to-energy empire has come under intense pressure and lost more than $100bn in market capitalisation after short seller Hindenburg Research accused his group of fraud and stock price manipulation.

The wipeout prompted a margin call from lenders, which include Barclays, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, on a $1.1bn share-backed loan, while France’s TotalEnergies paused a planned $4bn hydrogen project with the group.

Adani Group stocks are in several of MSCI’s equity benchmarks including the India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock indices.

Rival index provider FTSE Russell said last month that Adani index constituents included in its benchmarks “will continue to remain eligible in accordance with the underlying index methodologies”.

Shares in Adani Group’s listed companies sold off following Wednesday’s statement, with flagship business Adani Enterprises falling as much as 15 per cent after posting gains for two straight days.

An Asia equity strategist at one Wall Street investment bank said MSCI was likely to follow the precedent set by previous reviews of different companies and cut its free float estimates by about half.

“Potentially the weight of Adani stocks in the indices will be cut in half as a result, and passive investors will have to sell to reduce [the stocks’] weight accordingly in their portfolios,” the strategist said, adding that the bank estimated this would result in about $1bn-$1.5bn of outflows.

Those outflows will add to pressure on the company’s Mumbai-listed shares, which are components in MSCI’s India, Asia, emerging markets and all-country world stock benchmarks.

The Adani Group did not respond to a request for comment.

Hindenburg’s report alleges that the Indian business empire uses funds domiciled offshore in Mauritius to conceal the true extent of the Adani family’s ownership of the group’s listed companies, as well as to skirt rules governing how much stock insiders can own.

Nathan Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg, said on Twitter following the MSCI announcement: “We view this as validation of our findings on offshore stock parking by Adani.”

The Adani Group, whose stocks account for more than 3 per cent of MSCI’s India index, has denied the claims.

Indian tax officials visited one of the warehouses of Adani Wilmar, the group’s joint venture with the Singapore food processing business, in the state of Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday evening.

“The officials did not find any irregularities in the operations and dealings conducted by the company,” said Adani Wilmar. “We would like to emphasise that this was a routine inspection carried out by the relevant authorities and there was no raid as previously stated or reported in the media.”","MSCI on Thursday evening said it had cut its determined free float for four companies in the Adani Group: Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC.
Free float measures for four other companies in the group remained the same.
On Wednesday, MSCI said “certain investors” in Adani Group “should no longer be designated as free float pursuant to our methodology” after receiving feedback from “a range of market participants”.

#AdaniMess | The number 1 & 2 priorities for #GautamAdani are to clear his name and to make sure shareholders regain confidence in him. Fortunately for him his group is insulated from the stock market: Raian Karanjawala whose firm has represented #Adani pic.twitter.com/bjmDSZgRhE February 3, 2023

""The answer is simple, Gautam Adani has one advantage over most other industrialists which is his Samdhi happens to own one of India's largest litigating firms, that's Cyril Amarchand Shroff. So everything that will be done will be caliberated by them and I'm sure that they will react at the right time"", Karanjawala told Arnab.

So you are looking at early days. I'm sure there will be a response"", he added.

Responding to Hindenburg's challenge of taking the matter to a US court and if the Adani Group is in a defensive mode, Karanjawala said that ""American jurisdiction has certain drawbacks"".

""At the moment the Adani Group's major concern is stakeholder value. I think what they are really doing is concentrating on keeping that robust and then I'm sure they will react,"" Karanjawala said.

Karanjawala reveals two of Gautam Adani's major priorities

""The number 1 in Adani's two priorities are clearing his name and two, making sure his shareholders regain confidence in him, making sure that the stock market regains confidence in him"", Karanjawala said. ""Fortunately for him, his business is largely insulated from the share market. Because he deals in sports, he deals in airports, he deals in cement and power"". He also said that the fundamentals are strong.

Meanwhile on Friday, investors did show confidence in a few Adani Group companies as shares of Adani Enterprises rebounded 1.25% to settle at Rs 1,584.20 a piece on the BSE after tumbling 35% to Rs 1,017.10. Adani Ports also bounced back climbing 7.98% to Rs 498.85 per share after tanking 14.51% to Rs 394.95.

All About The Firm That’s Stirred A Confrontation With Adani,"The Adani Group and New York-based financial research firm Hindenburg Research have been embroiled in a fierce back-&-forth for almost a week. Hindenburg claimed to have carried out a 2-year-long investigation into the Adani group, following which it posed 88 questions. The Adani group has refuted allegations against it in a 413-page statement. While the confrontation continues, it has led to a spike in interest in Hindenburg Research. Here's all you need to know about it...

What is Hindenburg Research all about?

Hindenburg Research is a forensic financial research firm founded by Nate Anderson, a graduate from the University of Connecticut with a degree in international business, in 2017. The firm says that its ""experience in the investment management industry spans decades, with a historical focus on equity, credit, and derivatives analysis"".

The firm says that it uses fundamental analysis to aid its investment decision making, they believe that the most ""impactful research results from uncovering hard-to-find information from atypical sources"". The firm focuses on situations where companies may have been any combination of the following:

Accounting irregularities

Bad actors in management or key service provider roles

Undisclosed related-party transactions

Illegal/unethical business or financial reporting practices

Undisclosed regulatory, product, or financial issues

Why is the firm named “Hindenburg”?

The research firm's name has been adapted from the infamous Hindenburg disaster of May 6, 1937 in which the passenger airship 'LZ 129 Hindenburg' caught of fire and exploded, claiming the lives of 35 individuals. ""We view the Hindenburg as the epitome of a totally man-made, totally avoidable disaster,"" says the firm's website. The airship which was technically a large balloon carried almost a hundred people was filled with ""the most flammable element in the universe"" - Hydrogen gas.

The incident back in 1937 occured even after dozens of hydrogen-based aircrafts had met a similar fate earlier. The attitude and perspective of the operators of the Hindenburg airship has been compared to the lens through which people at Wall Street look at the stock market, with the maxim - “this time is different”.

""We look for similar man-made disasters floating around in the market and aim to shed light on them before they lure in more unsuspecting victims,"" the research firm has said.

What is short selling?

Short selling in stock markets is where people borrow shares of a company's stock and sell them, hoping the stock price would go down. Then they would buy the stock back at a lower price and return it to the person they borrowed it from. This is how people can make money when they think the stock price is going to go down.

In simple terms, short selling is when you borrow something, like a toy from a friend, with the promise to give it back later. But instead of keeping the toy, you sell it to someone else. If the price of the toy goes down, you can buy it back at a lower price and give it back to your friend. The difference between what you sold it for and what you bought it back for is your profit.

Short selling, when done properly under the ambit of wise regulations, can have positive impact on financial markets. However, short selling can also have a negative impact on financial markets. When too many people short sell a stock, the price can fall excessively, leading to a downward spiral that can harm companies and investors.

This is because when the stock price falls, the company may face challenges such as lower morale, reduced investor confidence, and difficulty in obtaining new financing. Additionally, if the price falls too far, it can trigger automatic selling by investors, causing the price to fall even further.","The Adani Group and New York-based financial research firm Hindenburg Research have been embroiled in a fierce back-&-forth for almost a week.

""We have no exposure left to Adani...",2023-02-09 00:00:00,Norway's $1.35-trn wealth fund says it has no exposure left in Adani Group companies,"Norway's $1.35-trillion sovereign wealth fund said on Thursday it has in recent weeks divested virtually all its remaining shares in companies belonging to the embattled Adani Group.

The fund, at the end of 2022, held stakes in Adani Total Gas, Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone and Adani Green Energy. ""We have no exposure left to Adani companies. Since 2022-end we have further reduced our exposure to Adani companies,"" said Christopher Wright, the fund's head of ESG risk monitoring.

""We have monitored Adani for many years (on ESG) issues, many on their handling of environmental risks,"" he said.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, at the end of 2022, held a stake in Adani Total worth $83.6 million, a stake in Adani Ports worth $63.4 million and a stake in Adani Green Energy of $52.7 million.

The fund, managed by a unit of the central bank, owns 1.3 per cent of all globally listed shares with stakes in some 9,200 companies.

On January 31, the CEO of Norway's $1.3-trillion oil fund said the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund has been reducing stakes in Adani Group companies owing to the ""complex situation"" arising out of potential risks attached to the ports-to-power conglomerate.

“We have sold out of quite a few [of Adani companies] and we have reduced in some of the others. So we have very, very little exposure compared with what you would have expected us to have,” Nicolai Tangen told UK's Financial Times.

Adani Group stocks have been facing intense volatility ever since US short seller Hindenburg Research's January 24 alleged improper use of offshore tax havens and concerns about high debt, which Adani denied, but the subsequent market meltdown has led to a dramatic and sudden fall in group chairman Gautam Adani's fortunes.

The oil fund reduced its positions in Adani companies because of risks such as potential corruption, environmental damage and human rights abuses, Tangen had said.

“It’s a complex situation. We have a separate department that is looking at risk-based divestments . . . We started to look at this a long time ago, and so we have taken a lot of exposure out.”

The oil fund, which usually owns on average 1.3 per cent of a stock, had holdings at the end of 2022 of 0.3 per cent in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, 0.17 per cent in Adani Total Gas and 0.14 per cent in Adani Green Energy.

Financial index provider MSCI said on Thursday that some Adani securities should no longer be designated as free float, after market participants raised concerns about the eligibility of the Indian conglomerate's companies for some of its indexes.

MSCI, the US-based creator of widely-watched stock indexes, said in a statement that it ""has received feedback from a range of market participants concerning the eligibility and free float determination of specific securities.

""MSCI has determined that the characteristics of certain investors have sufficient uncertainty that they should no longer be designated as free float ... This determination has triggered a free float review of the Adani Group securities,"" it added.

Changes for Adani securities associated with its MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes are due to be announced later on Thursday as part of its regular review for February.

MSCI defines the free float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that is considered available for purchase in public equity markets by international investors.

In response to the MSCI statement, Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson wrote on Twitter: ""We view this as validation of our findings"".

Some of Adani companies shares had been rebounding this week but tumbled again on Thursday after the MSCI announcement. Adani Enterprises sank 11.2 per cent, after losing as much as 20 per cent in early morning trade.

Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas and Adani Power were each down 5 per cent, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone were down nearly 2.9 per cent.

Commenting on the 413-page response Adani Group released late on Sunday evening in response to its report, Hindenburg said it believed India was a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future and it was Adani Group which was holding it back through ""systematic loot"".

Hindenburg stood by its last week's report that said its two-year investigation found Adani Group ""engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades"".

Hindenburg said the response by the conglomerate run by Asia's richest man Gautam Adani ""opened with the sensationalistic claim that we are the 'Madoffs of Manhattan'.""

Adani also claimed we have committed a ""flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws.""

""Despite Adani's failure to identify any such laws, this is another serious accusation that we categorically deny,"" it said.

Adani Group had on Sunday evening likened the damning allegations levied by Hindenburg to a ""calculated attack"" on India, its institutions and growth story, saying the allegations are ""nothing but a lie"".

It said the report was driven by ""an ulterior motive"" to ""create a false market"" to allow the US firm make financial gains by dragging stock prices down. The document is ""a malicious combination of selective misinformation and concealed facts relating to baseless and discredited allegations to drive an ulterior motive.""

""This is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities to enable Hindenburg, an admitted short seller, to book massive financial gain through wrongful means at the cost of countless investors,"" it had said questioning the credibility and ethics of Hindenburg.

Hindenburg responded saying Adani Group ""predictably tried to lead the focus away from substantive issues and instead stoked a nationalist narrative.""

""Adani Group has attempted to conflate its meteoric rise and the wealth of its Chairman, Gautam Adani, with the success of India itself,"" it said.

""We disagree. To be clear, we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future. We also believe India's future is being held back by Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation.""

Stating that a ""fraud is fraud even when it's perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world,"" it said Adani's '413-page' response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to the report.

""The remainder of the response consisted of 330 pages of court records, along with 53 pages of high-level financials, general information, and details on irrelevant corporate initiatives, such as how it encourages female entrepreneurship and the production of safe vegetables,"" it said.

""Our report asked 88 specific questions of Adani Group. In its response, Adani failed to specifically answer 62 of them. Instead, it mainly grouped questions together in categories and provided generalized deflections."" It thereafter went on to reiterate its allegations and how Adani Group has failed to respond to them.

The report by the tiny New York firm that specialises in short selling led to Adani Group losing more than USD 50 billion in market value in just two trading sessions last week and Adani himself losing in excess of USD 20 billion, or about one-fifth of his total fortune.

In the report, Hindenburg called out the conglomerate's ""substantial debt"", which includes pledging shares for loans; that Adani's brother Vinod ""manages a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities"" that move billions into group companies without required disclosure; and that its auditor ""hardly seems capable of complex audit work""","Commenting on the 413-page response Adani Group released late on Sunday evening in response to its report, Hindenburg said it believed India was a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future and it was Adani Group which was holding it back through ""systematic loot"".

He also said the party should formulate a new plan to carry forward the ""tapasya"" undertaken through the Bharat Jodo Yatra and that he, along with the entire country, will participate in it, indicating another such initiative.

Launching a strong attack on the government on the Adani issue, he charged that the industrialist was working against the country by cornering its entire wealth.

The US-based Hindenburg Research had made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the Adani Group.

The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Addressing the 85th plenary session of the Congress here, Gandhi said, ""When we asked in Parliament what is the prime minister's relation with Adani, our entire speech was expunged. We will ask in Parliament thousands of times until the truth of Adani ji is out, we will not stop."" His remark drew a round of applause.

""I want to tell Adani that his company is hurting the country and is snatching the entire infrastructure of country,"" the former Congress president charged.

""The battle for the country's freedom was against one company as it had taken away all wealth and ports, etc.,"" he said, referring to the British East India Company.

""History is being repeated. This is work against the country and if that happens the entire Congress party will stand against it,"" he said.

Referring to his Kanyakumari-to-Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra, he said lakhs of people participated in the foot march and he learnt a lot during it.

He said first he used to share his knowledge with farmers, but then he started listening. ""By the time I reached Jammu and Kashmir, I turned quiet,"" he said.

He said that as the march entered Kashmir, thousands of people joined it. ""A boy asks me when the people of Kashmir are hurting and in pain, why are others in the country happy? I told him that it is not so,"" he said.

He said the moment the march entered the valley, police personnel vanished but he saw ""tiranga"" (the national tricolour) being raised by thousands of people of Kashmir, even in areas the worst affected by terrorism.

""The Kashmiri youths have tiranga in their hands and CRPF people said they had never seen this before.... We saw the PM's speech in Parliament and he said he also unfurled the national flag in Srinagar's Lal Chowk along with a few BJP people.... I said he did not understand the issue.

""Narendra Modi hoisted the flag at Lal Chowk, but the Bharat Jodo Yatra made thousands of Kashmiris unfurl the national flag. PM did not understand (it).... You took away the feeling of love for Indian tricolour from the people of Kashmir, but we made them unfurl it,"" he said.

""The love for the national flag comes from the heart and we made Kashmiris unfurl the flag on their own after we awakened the feeling inside them as they trusted us,"" Gandhi said, amid a loud applause.","The US-based Hindenburg Research had made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the Adani Group.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/adani-rise-reading-list,,None,A Journalistic History of the Adani Group,"What would a brief history of India Inc look like?

At the time of independence, India’s private sector was dominated by a clutch of business families.

Their reign continued into the license raj years – and then was challenged by newcomers like Dhirubhai Ambani. In the 1990s, the country saw the flowering of a new generation of companies. These were the post-liberalisation firms in both new sectors like IT, ITES (IT-enabled services), healthcare and telecom as well as older sectors like infrastructure.

Relations between these promoters and India’s political leadership covered a broad spectrum. Firms operating in sectors where the government had a relatively small role – think IT – had low interaction. Firms in government-heavy sectors – like infrastructure – made larger allowances for India’s political economy. Some stayed equidistant from political parties, donating to all. Others forged opportunistic alliances with the party in power. Yet others were owned (covertly or overtly) by politicians themselves.

Political patronage itself stayed opportunistic. In both the captive coal block allocation scam and Arunachal Pradesh’s hydelscam, firms willing to pay trounced more established rivals and bagged coal blocks and hydel MoUs. This was broad-spectrum crony capitalism. As this reporter has written earlier: “Companies with political links got what they wanted. And so did others. All that mattered was their willingness to pay.”

In this system, it was hard to say who was in the driving seat. Industrialists could get their way through bribes. Politicians could determine who got the largesse.

With Gautam Adani, India is seeing something new. According to economic commentators, the government has chosen his group as a ‘national champion’ – and is encouraging its expansion into a clutch of sectors critical for India. At the same time, the financial underpinnings of the group are opaque – like its quicksilver pace of growth despite the absence of cash cows in the group; shadowy investors; charges of stock-price manipulation, and a thick density of related-party transactions.

This combination needs to be understood. How was the group chosen as a national champion? Is that the right strategy for India – or could it push India closer to a pairing, as described by James Robinson and Daron Acemoglu, between an extractive political institution and an extractive economic institution, both working for a few?

The latter worry is not an imagined fear. Given the financial pressures to win elections, India’s political parties are increasingly kleptocratic. As for Adani, there are multiple instances of him abusing his market position.

In all, Adani represents a new chapter in the evolution of India Inc. The Wire has strung together a reading list that traces his journey towards becoming a “national champion”.

1. The backstory: In 2013, Economic Times profiled Adani, describing his early days – importing plastic granules from Gandhidham; upgrading into wider trading; and then backwards integrating into Mundra port – and his consequential alliance with then-chief minister Narendra Modi. As the paper says, Modi took charge in 2001 as CM but “did not want to depend on Pramod Mahajan, who was managing the BJP’s finances”. As for Adani, he wanted to grow big in a state that already had Reliance.

2. Adani in Gujarat: Under Modi, the company saw meteoric growth in Gujarat. Its record was mixed. On one hand, it created a world-class port complex at Mundra. On the other, its growth was underpinned by state support. It got government largesse, as described in multiple CAG reports; the SEZ at Mundra came up without an environment clearance; rival ports like state-owned Kandla made a series of decisions which hurt them but benefitted Mundra; one could go on. The Union government, run by the Congress-fronted UPA at the time, played along as well, taking the environmental violations at Mundra port as a fait accompli.

3. The first Modi term: Once Modi came to power at the Centre, Adani went national. Scroll looked at the group’s growth between 2014 and 2019 – a mix of inorganic growth (where Adani bought stranded assets off India’s bankruptcy courts); growth in existing businesses; and forays into new sectors.

4. How the group financed this expansion is a puzzle. In 2018, for instance, it announced future expenditure of Rs 167,000 crore despite a net profit of just Rs 3,455.34 crore. The answer seemed to lie (partially) in an arrangement where the group floated new companies, pledged their shares to raise money, and then deployed those funds across the group – to shore up struggling firms; and as equity to start more new firms. Researchers in Australia too flagged similar patterns.

The government stayed supportive. It set up a committee to ensure Adani Power did not slip into bankruptcy proceedings.

The group also benefited from other government decisions. One instance is Adani’s power project at Godda. Another instance is the claim by a Sri Lankan power official that Modi had asked Gotabaya Rajapaksa to award a project to Adani. A third instance is airports, where rules were changed to get him in.

In tandem, investigations into the group went nowhere – like the DRI investigation into coal imports.

5. The government’s preferred ‘national champion’: When the NDA first came to power, business circles speculated that Modi would create five or six large business houses – to cut down on Reliance’s overweening dominance in India’s political economy. Relations between India Inc and the government were changing. See this issue of Seminar for more.

This looks like an excellent issue of Seminar, co-edited by @rahul_tverma & @rohitreads, on state-capital relations in India https://t.co/Lg5RpRriRR pic.twitter.com/UfOrNsBqok — Milan Vaishnav (@MilanV) October 5, 2020

The names of a few firms did the rounds in the first term – Vedanta in mining; Dilip Buildcon in construction; JSW in steel; Adani in infrastructure; etc. By 2019, however, Adani had eclipsed them all. Modi began relying more on Adani, using the group to meet India’s global commitments on fronts like decarbonisation. The group forayed into defence, drones, polysilicon, and more. In a report, FT called him “Modi’s Rockefeller”. The underpinning of this expansion, however, remained sizeably unclear.

6. The mystery of the investment funds: Then came a report from The Morning Context, saying a handful of investment funds invest almost solely in Adani – most of the group’s free float was with them. Economic Times followed up when NSDL froze these funds’ accounts due to “insufficient disclosure of information regarding beneficial ownership”. Speculation grew that these funds had been used to drive up Adani share prices – which could then be pledged as collateral by the group.

7. Enter, Hindenburg: In its report, the short-seller sizably focused on these funds. It was followed by a rebuttal from Adani late on Sunday night. By Monday morning, Hindenburg had released its own response. Read all three documents and you will have a fairly decent sense of how the group finances its operations.

As things stand, Hindenburg isn’t the only organisation to say Adani Enterprises are over-valued. Here is Hindu Businessline. It steers clear of Hindenburg’s report but finds overvaluation all the same.

8. Post-FPO Adani: As this article gets written, the group’s FPO has been a success – retail investors stayed out but a handful of big industrialists stepped in. On February 1, however, Adani shares began falling once markets opened. In tandem came the news that Credit Suisse will not accept bonds of Gautam Adani’s group of companies as collateral for margin loans – a line of credit that lets clients borrow against the securities they hold. One wonders what happens next.","Relations between these promoters and India’s political leadership covered a broad spectrum.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/government/no-govt-probe-on-adani-but-sebi-investigating-market-allegations-centre,,None,No Govt Probe on Adani but SEBI Investigating 'Market Allegations': Centre,"New Delhi: The Union government has said that there is no probe committee from its end to investigate allegations against the Adani Group but the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has undertaken an “investigation into the market allegations” against the conglomerate.

The government also said that it had submitted to the Supreme Court that it was “already enquiring into the allegations made in the Hindenburg report as well as the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report”.

SEBI to submit a report into allegations against Adani group in two months

In response to a question from Congress MP Manish Tewari, who had also asked about the details of the agenda of the SEBI investigation and the proposed timeline of its completion, the minister of state for finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, stated that the Supreme Court has directed SEBI to conclude the ongoing investigations within two months.

To a query from the MP on “the scope/remit of the Committee to investigate the Adani Group as suggested by the Government to the Supreme Court and the reasons for giving such suggestions/names in a sealed cover”, the Minister said “the Government of India submitted its suggestions on the remit of the Committee proposed to be constituted” by the apex court.

He added that the suggested terms of reference were shared with the petitioners on the directions of the court. These directed the panel “to ascertain and submit a report regarding the truthfulness or otherwise of the allegations made against Adani group of companies in the Hindenburg Report; to ascertain and submit a report regarding Hindenburg’s admitted claim of taking a ‘short position in Adani group Companies through US traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivatives instruments’ prior to the publication of its subject report with all underlying transactions undertaken/ made either by Hindenburg itself, its associated companies/ concerns and/ or connected entities/ individuals, whether within or outside India in violation of any regulatory/ penal/ preventive or other statutory provisions”.

Furthermore, the reply stated that the panel would “ascertain and submit a report regarding the details of all undisclosed ‘short position’ and/ or other transactions, source of funds and profits made by short sellers in India or abroad prior to and/or in near proximity of the Hindenburg report” and “suggest measures to strengthen investor awareness including at the point of trade”.

DRI probe into import of Indonesian coal by Adani group has ‘not reached finality’

Several other MPs also raised questions on the Adani issue in the Lok Sabha.

Another Congress MP S. Jothimani asked about the key findings and outcomes of the probe by SEBI and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) into the Adani group companies. In reply to her question, the MoS finance submitted that “investigations pertaining to imports of Power Generation, Power Transmission and Infrastructure (Port & SEZ) equipment by Adani Group companies have been concluded by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and report has been submitted before the relevant judicial authorities”.

As regards the case pertaining to imports of Indonesian coal by the Adani Group of companies, the minister said, “investigations by DRI have not reached finality as information sought from exporting countries through execution of Letters Rogatory (LRs) is under litigation.”

‘Nine Adani companies witnessed 60% erosion of market cap after report’

Congress MP from Thrissur T.N. Prathapan asked about the “investigation into the stock market manipulation by Adani Group of Companies”. To a query from him on “whether the Government is aware of the fall in the fortune of the head of Adani group of companies and if so, the details thereof and the reaction of the Government thereto; and whether the Government is aware of the reasons behind the said fall in the fortune of Adani group of companies”, the MoS Finance stated that

“the nine listed companies forming part of Adani Group witnessed a decline of around 60% of market capitalization from January 24, 2023, till March 01, 2023 subsequent to the report published by Hindenburg Research.”

The Minister added that “these companies are not part of Sensex and have a combined weight of below 1% in Nifty.” He added that “the volatility in the stocks of these companies have not had any significant impact at the systemic level. Nifty 50 declined by around 2.9% in the month of January 2023 and by around 4.9% in the 2-month period of January and February 2023.”

‘Centre has not constituted any committee to probe allegations against the Adani group’

To another question from Communist Party of India MP K. Subbarayan on “whether the Government has constituted any Committee to investigate the allegations made against the Adani Group of companies by short-seller Hindenburg Research of the US”, the minister replied in the negative.

Yet another question was posed on the issue by Revolutionary Socialist Party MP N.K. Premachandran who asked if the Government has analysed the impact of the Hindenburg report in the corporate sector of the country and if it proposed to “restrict disbursement of further loans to the likes of Adani Group of companies from nationalized banks and financial institutions of the Government in the light of the said report”.

To this, Chaudhary answered that “as per Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks are free to take credit-related decisions based on internal assessment of the commercial viability of the loan within their Board approved policies and within RBI’s prudential guidelines. Further, RBI has informed that under the provisions of section 45E of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, RBI is prohibited from disclosing credit information.”

LIC debt exposure to Adani group was Rs 6,182 crore on March 5

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in response to a written question from Congress MP Deepak Baij, who had asked about the details of loan/credit exposure of various public sector banks and insurance companies to Adani group of companies that “the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has informed that its debt exposure to Adani Group of Companies, as per annexed details, was Rs 6,347.32 crore and ₹6,182.64 crore, as on 31.12.2022 and 5.3.2023, respectively.”

She added that “the five Public Sector General Insurance companies have informed that these companies do not have loan/credit exposure to Adani Group of Companies.”

On the question of risk of exposure to these companies, she stated that “as per inputs received from RBI, in order to protect banks from risk, it has implemented large exposure framework which limits the exposures that a bank can take to a single counterparty and a group of connected counterparties to 20 per cent (extendable to 25 per cent by the Board of the bank under exceptional circumstances) and 25 per cent, respectively, of the eligible capital base of the bank.”","New Delhi: The Union government has said that there is no probe committee from its end to investigate allegations against the Adani Group but the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has undertaken an “investigation into the market allegations” against the conglomerate.

Tips2trades' Ramachandran said, ""Adani Power is a riskier bet given all the news surrounding the Adani group stocks but a daily close above Rs 186 could lead to targets of Rs 199-222 in the coming weeks.""

It must be noted that Adani Group stocks took a major hit recently after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research alleged that the Indian conglomerate had engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the last few decades. Adani Group, however, refuted the claim as baseless.

Meanwhile, Indian equity benchmarks fell in late deals today, dragged by metals, consumer goods, energy and technology stocks.

The regulator, as reported in The Morning Context, has sought to check the beneficial owners of offshore funds and foreign portfolio, investors, by end of September.

The news report further claims that SEBI is, in particular, investigating the relationship between two Mauritius-based funds — The Great International Tusker Fund and Ayushmat Ltd — which participated in Adani Enterprises’ 2.4 billion USD (which translates to Rs 20,000 crore), follow-on public offer.

“The share sale was called off after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research published a report last month alleging stock manipulation, accounting irregularities and fraud at the group,” The Morning Context report points out.

Easy regulations and taxation policies of Mauritius make it attractive for overseas investors, allowing for tax evasion and roundtripping of funds, The Morning Context report suggests.

Hindenburg Research, in its report published last month, which Adani group has vehemently denied, has claimed that Mauritius-based funds were a vehicle to “cut the trails and conceal the identity of an investor bringing cash from overseas” into the Indian stock market.

The Morning Context piece, reported by Advait Palepu, points to the two old investigations in which the promoter entities based in Mauritius were investigated and cleared by the depository companies. Palepu writes that the data with the Corporate and Business Registration Department in Mauritius reveals that five of the 13 funds have several commonalities including directors, addresses and their management companies. All five funds are ultimately linked to one Jayechund Jingree, a taxation and investment structure specialist in Mauritius who was a director of the Adani group’s local subsidiary 20 years ago.

“We also found that directors of a sixth fund — The Great International Tusker Fund — are closely linked to Mauritius entities that are associated with Vinod Adani, Adani group chairman Gautam Adani’s older brother, and Subir Mittra, the head of the Adani Family Office,” the article claims. While the connections show common directors and ownership between the investment entities, they do not reveal details about the source of funds, The Morning Context report shows.","Mumbai: Earlier this month, the regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) asked banks to share details on the infrastructure conglomerate Adani’s Mauritius connections.

The official added that the company is waiting for the completion of statutory formalities like a draft concession agreement.

The Adani Ports & SEZ Ltd (APSEZ) will work towards the plan and timeline once all the formalities are complete, the official said.

""We remain committed to Tajpur deep-sea port and awaiting the statutory requirements from the state, associated with the project,"" the official said when contacted but declined to be identified.

The official also said that the state government has been very supportive and has guided the company at every step. The port is among the key projects for the economic development of West Bengal.

Adani Ports incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary named Tajpur Sagar Port in October last year for the purpose of developing a deep-sea port at Tajpur. West Bengal government handed the Letter of Award to Karan Adani, CEO of, APSEZ for the development of a port at a post-Durga event. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was also present during the event.

MCC president Namit Bajoria recently said that the Tajpur project is crucial for the state as it will have a multiplier effect on the economy of the state and Adani Group will move ahead with the project.

The project is expected to provide 25,000 direct jobs and indirect employment opportunities of around 1,00,000. The Adani Group will be investing around ₹25,000 into the project.

The confirmation came after Adani Group lost more than $120 billion in market capitalization after the US-based Hindenburg Research accused the Group of “accounting fraud and stock manipulation"". The report raised doubts over the high debts of the ports-to-energy conglomerate and also accused it of using offshore entities in tax havens to manipulate its companies.

Adani Group has categorically denied the allegation but its stock price remains volatile.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/adani-group-enron-larry-summers,,None,"Adani Group Situation Is India's 'Possible Enron Moment', Says Larry Summers","New Delhi: Former US treasury secretary and former Harvard University president Larry Summers has compared the recent allegations in the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani group to Enron scandal in the US. This, the economist claimed, could be India’s “possible Enron moment”.

During Bloomberg’s Wall Street Week last Friday, Summers was asked what he was looking for from the G20 meetings. He didn’t name Adani, but said, “We haven’t talked about it on the show but there’s been a kind of possible Enron moment in India…”

“And I imagine with India emerging as the world’s largest country and the meeting taking place in India, there’s going to be a lot of curiosity from all present about how that’s going to play through and what – if any – larger systemic implications that’s going to have for India,” he continued.

Summers was likening the situation in India now to the accounting scandal involving the Enron Corporation, a US-based energy company, that was exposed in 2001. Executives of the company had falsely inflated revenues and hidden trading losses, and once this became public the company declared bankruptcy. Enron share prices plummeted in 2001.

When the scandal came to light, US regulator the SEC, credit ratings agencies and investment banks were accused of negligence and lack of due diligence, and in some cases even deception.

Released on January 24, Hindenburg Research’s report on the Adani group has made allegations of large-scale accounting fraud and stock manipulation. Since then, group companies’ stock prices have been falling rapidly. The Adani group has denied all allegations, and even claimed that the allegations are an attack on India as a whole.

In an interaction on Tuesday with institutional investors, Adani Group CFO Jugeshinder Singh said that while foreign banks took ‘credit decisions,’ Indian banks took ‘name decisions’. Of the total group debt, over half is foreign debt in the form of overseas bonds and loans taken from foreign entities, a fifth is from foreign banks and a fourth is from domestic banks. Singh pegged the group’s gross debt at $30 billion.

The Hindu Business Line reports that some Indian banks had expressed reluctance to lend more to Adani Group companies, inducing a cash crunch in some projects. While it could not be ascertained what exactly Singh meant by ‘name decisions’, throughout the crisis, foreign banks have been supportive of the Group in terms of continued funding.","New Delhi: Former US treasury secretary and former Harvard University president Larry Summers has compared the recent allegations in the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani group to Enron scandal in the US.

This, according to Livemint means a fall of over $135 billion, since the Hindenburg Research report which accused the group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud was released on January 24.

The decline in Adani Enterprises was the maximum compared to other group companies on Monday, according to Business Today. The Adani Group’s flagship shares slipped by about 9.33%.

There were consequences on the net worth of the group chairman too, as Gautam Adani’s net worth slipped to less than $50 billion today. As per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the billionaire’s net worth slipped to $49.1 billion – placing him 25th on the global rich list today. Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires List, ranked Adani at the 25th spot too but pegged his net worth lower, at $47.6 billion. Forbes said he has lost $2.8 billion in the last 24 hours.

The Telegraph reports that Gautam Adani is no longer India’s richest man, falling far behind Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani who is worth $85 billion. The newspaper writes that the Ahmedabad-based billionaire was worth $147 billion at his peak and was for some time, also the richest person in Asia and the second-richest person in the world. Only Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk was richer than him at that point.

Adani Group’s stocks had been climbing at a rapid rate over the past year until the downward trend set in sharply, after short-seller Hindenburg’s allegations of several corporate malpractices spooked markets.

The Adani group has denied the allegations levelled by Hindenburg in a 413-page response, and has also been repaying loans and trying to convince investors that it is not about to default on its many loans. It has billion-dollar infrastructure projects at hand from ports, airports, roads, green energy, power generation and transmission, gas distribution, data centres and the media.

As reported by The Wire, opposition members of parliament in the Budget session came together in both Houses of Parliament on the issue of allegations against the Adani Group and raised slogans terming the Narendra Modi government an “Adani sarkar”. They also demanded that the prime minister tell the nation what his government is doing on the issue. The Union government has steadfastly refused to either allow a discussion or make a statement or institute a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on issues of alleged corporate malfeasance in the Adani matter.","New Delhi: Adani stocks continued to slip in the share market on Monday, February 20, and the Adani Group’s market capitalisation slipped below $100 billion.

While rejecting a sealed cover from the Union government containing proposed names and the remit of the committee, a bench led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said the court will constitute the committee to ensure “full (public) confidence”, Livelaw.in reported.

“We want full transparency… if we accept [these] suggestions, then it will be seen as a government-appointed committee, which we do not want. Leave it to us to decide,” CJI Chandrachud said, according to NDTV.

He also went on to say, however, “We can’t start with a presumption of regulatory failure.”

Hearing a batch of petitions on the Adani Group controversy, the court last week had sought the views of the Union government and SEBI to protect Indian investors. The government had then informed the court that it was fine with the constitution of a committee while requesting that its remit should not be defined in such a manner that foreign and domestic investors feel there are inadequacies in the regulatory framework.

One of the petitioners, Vishal Sharma, told the court that he wanted “a proper valuation of the shares for loans being given by banks” as well as an audit of the Adani companies. He sought directions from the court to appoint a Supreme Court judge to investigate the contents of the Hindenburg report.

Another petitioner, M.L. Sharma, sought “action against Hindenburg”. He wanted action against Nathan Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg, “for exploiting innocent Investors via short selling under the garb of artificial crashing”. He urged the court to declare short selling an offence of fraud.

Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan, appearing for another petitioner, sought a special investigation team be set up under the supervision of the Supreme Court to look into the Hindenburg report, flagging the alleged violation of stock market rules by the Adani Group.

According to NDTV, the government lawyer, Tushar Mehta, said, “We are not objecting to an investigation on the [Adani Group] promoters or the Hindenburg report… SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) and all regulatory bodies have discharged their duties so far.”

The court concluded the hearing on the matter and reserved its orders for a later day.","New Delhi: Turning down the names proposed by the Union government, the Supreme Court on Friday, February 17, said it will form an expert committee to review regulatory mechanism in light of the Adani-Hindenburg case.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/energy/hindenburg-adani-green-energy,,None,Will the Hindenburg Episode Affect Adani's – and India's – Energy Plans?,"In early February, as the market was absorbing the immediate impact of Hindenburg’s exhaustive report on Adani’s alleged improprieties, cabinet minister R.K. Singh struck a sanguine note. Speaking at a press conference, Singh, India’s minister for New and Renewable Energy, dismissed concerns that the Adani Group’s current crisis might hurt India’s clean energy plans.

“I have the most robust renewable energy capacity in the world and that means that I have at least 15-16 large companies which are at the level of global companies,” he said, adding: “It will not impact us in any way.”

Even at first glance, the minister’s words seem counterintuitive. Scan any part of India’s energy sector – coal, gas, renewable energy or RE, hydrogen or solar – and you will find an oversized imprint of Adani’s presence.

Not only is the group one of the biggest RE developers in the country, it’s one of three firms chosen by the Indian government for the solar module manufacturing PLI. The group is also an early mover into sectors considered critical by India’s NDA government – like pumped storage and hydrogen. For the latter, it aims to be the largest fully integrated green hydrogen player in the world. It’s the only large firm vying with RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani to create a clean energy ecosystem in India spanning solar, wind, batteries and electrolysers.

For this reason, India needs a more careful answer to the question reporters had asked Singh. Given the short-selling attack, what happens to the group’s clean-energy plans? What does that mean for India’s own low-carbon ambitions?

There are no easy answers to these questions. The Adani Group has grown sizeably in recent years by borrowing against its pledged shares and bonds. What we are seeing right now is a battle over the worth of these instruments – is it in line with the value they intend to secure?

Take the recent price movements of shares of Adani’s crown jewel, Adani Enterprises, for instance. In December 2022, its share’s value stood at Rs 4,165. On February 3, 10 days after Hindenburg’s report, its share slipped below Rs 1,050 before climbing back, by February 8, to Rs 2,200. In the week since, it has once again fallen by 20%, and stands at about Rs 1,750 at the time of publishing. Other group companies have traced similar trajectories. It remains unclear what their real value is. Two economic commentators – veteran business editor T.N. Ninan and academic Aswath Damodaran – found Adani shares over-valued even after falling for two weeks.

A similar battle is underway in bonds as well. Over the past three weeks, Adani bonds shed enough value to enter distressed assets territory. Adani Green Energy dollar bonds due in 2024 slid 13.4 cents on the dollar to 61.6. Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone notes due in 2031 fell 5.2 cents to 63.2. A clutch of large financial institutions, including Credit Suisse, CitiGroup and Standard Chartered, announced they wouldn’t take Adani bonds as collateral. In tandem, however, firms specialising in distressed bonds have picked up $1 billion worth of Adani’s overseas bonds.

Given that this repricing is still underway, it’s hard to surmise how the group’s future borrowings will change and the attendant implications for the group’s plans.

Adani’s climate footprint

Seen through a climate lens, the group has four deeply consequential verticals.

Foremost is the coal-based vertical. This started with power plants before integrating backwards into coal imports, coal mines, coal mining and ships, and integrating forwards into transmission lines and DISCOMs. Today, as CarbonCopy reported two years ago, Adani and NTPC are the only thermal power producers in India that straddle the entire thermal power value chain, from coal mines to DISCOMs.

Next up is the gas-based vertical. Through separate partnerships with Total and IOC, Adani has been picking up city gas distribution contracts to supply CNG to vehicles and piped natural gas to homes and industries. Then there is the renewable energy vertical with substantial capital tied up in wind, solar and pumped storage projects.

And finally, there is ANIL (Adani New Industries Limited). Shortly after Mukesh Ambani announced Reliance’s Rs 75,000 crore clean energy push (four giga-factories to make solar modules, batteries, electrolysers and fuel cells), Adani Group made a matching claim. ANIL would house its equivalent push into renewables (green hydrogen) and renewables manufacturing – wind turbines, solar modules, electrolysers.

The group is not shy of ambition for all four verticals.

In coal-based power, it is developing seven new coal mines, adding two new thermal power plants, trying to add another 11,000 km to its existing 20,000 km by 2030, trying to acquire state-owned DISCOMs plus acquire power distribution licences in large markets like Delhi and Mumbai, and chalking up investment plans for each. In gas, it has picked up 52 city gas distribution bids and aims to cover 15% of India’s population by 2030. In renewables, Adani Green’s operational (and under-construction) assets add up to 20.4 GW. The group wants to amp this up to 45 GW by 2030.

For ANIL, investments have been pegged at $20 billion (Rs 160,000 crore) over the next 10 years. Elsewhere, even larger numbers have been cited. In June 2022, group chairperson Gautam Adani said the group (and Total) will jointly invest $50 billion (Rs400,000 crore) over the next 10 years on green hydrogen alone.

As boggling as these numbers are, they are a part of a larger thrust. Adani has equally ambitious projections for most of its non-energy verticals as well – data centres, ports, airports, cement, road projects, defence, drones manufacturing, electric commercial vehicles, alumina, steel,agricultural logistics and trading. Its ambitions for packaged foods, edible oils and media seem relatively more prosaic.

In all, the group pegged its total investments at about $107 billion (₹856,000 crore) over the next 10 years.

In its cover story last December on Gautam Adani, India Today posited even higher expenditure. Adani Enterprises, it said, plans to spend $10.4 billion (over Rs 86,000 crore) as capital expenditure till 2024. “In the following five years from then on, the capex would be $49 billion (around Rs 4 lakh crore).”

This power and energy complex features heavily in Hindenburg’s report. Chief among a clutch of improprieties alleged by the short seller is the charge that the Adani Group has used a web of obscure investment funds located overseas that it controls to sidestep thresholds of shareholder requirements in order to be eligible for being publicly traded – and project an image of regulatory compliance. The group, as is known, has borrowed heavily to support its growth plans. According to Hindenburg, the group has propped up this debt-heavy model by inflating its share prices while cash flows have remained low relative to the debt eddying around the group.

Shares of Adani Power, Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy, all heavily implicated in the report, have at the time of writing shed 46%, 61% and 66% of their value since the report was released on 24th January. Adani Power stocks have been on a skid since they hit an all-time high of ₹432 in August 2022, and have lost two-thirds of their value since.

What are the fallouts?

A time to tighten belts

Over the past five or so years, the nature of Adani’s borrowings has changed.

The group has pivoted from bank borrowings to fund-raising through international bonds. “For the next five-10 years,” a senior executive with intimate knowledge of the group’s financials had told this reporter in 2019, “the global bond market will be the most important market for the group”.

That has come to pass. By October 2021, the group had become the biggest issuer of offshore bonds from India. In December 2022, as Gautam Adani told India Today, Indian banks’ share in the group’s total lending had come down to just 32%. “Almost 50% of our borrowing is now through international bonds,” he said.

This model – of raising money through international bonds – is in trouble.

In the immediate wake of the Hindenburg report, Adani bond prices fell steeply, slipping into distressed territory. Take Adani Green. “Bonds worth $750 million issued by Adani Green Energy are currently yielding a whopping 31% in international secondary markets, well past the average 8.4% for global junk bonds,” wrote Bloomberg. With other Adani bonds posting similar slides, Credit Suisse, CitiGroup and Standard Chartered said they would not accept Adani bonds as collateral.

That was followed by a recovery, as investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase pointed at the value of the group’s underlying assets. In tandem, distressed asset funds bought close to $1 billion (₹8,000 crore) worth of Adani bonds. To put that number in perspective, however, the group’s debt exposure in bonds stands nearly 14-times higher at ₹110,000 crore.

Put these developments together and you will see the bond market shrinking for the group. Some investors will likely exit and make way for new borrowings, but at a higher cost.

The company’s shares are in trouble as well. They had fallen steeply in the days after Hindenburg’s report came out—and then staged a short-lived recovery. As this article was being written, Moody’s downgraded its outlook for Adani Green and two subsidiaries of Adani Transmission. MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital Index), a global equity index, which represents large and mid-cap equity performance across all 23 developed markets, cut its weightage for Adani companies. In addition, the group has lost some investors (like Norway’s largest pension company KLP, which dumped all its shares in Adani Green Energy).

As shares lose value again, the group’s capacity to borrow via pledged shares will fall as well. Turning to banks, as The Ken wrote, it’s likely that any future big borrowings from Indian banks will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny.

In addition, the group has cancelled its FPO, which would have brought in another Rs 20,000 crore.

Given this arid landscape, the group says it might rely on promoter equity funding, private placement and internal accruals to fund growth.

That is easier said than done. The first hinges on the repricing that is currently underway. The second might yield high-cost loans. As for the third, the Adani group operates in long-gestation infrastructure projects. Most of these, additionally, generate modest profits.

To that, Adani adds its own complications. “The company’s return on invested capital has steadily declined, even as it has scaled up, hovering just over 3% in 2021-2022,” wrote NYU finance professor Ashwath Damodaran in his widely-read blogpost about Adani and Hindenburg.

This shows in the group’s numbers. After accounting for fresh expansion, taxes, depreciation, etc, Adani Group companies are not left with large profits. Adani Enterprises closed last financial year with a net income of ₹70,432 crore and net profit of ₹475 crore. Other group companies are pretty much the same.

In other words, it’s unclear if internal accruals can keep the group’s expansion plans intact.

That is just the start. Even as the group struggles to raise funds, it is being squeezed for capital. It has to urgently pare debt. It has already faced a margin call – when lenders demanded extra collateral after the pledged equity lost value. To place bonds, the group will have to pay higher rates. If it wants to shore up share prices, in order to avoid domestic margin calls, it will need capital there as well. Buying back its distressed bonds will carry substantial demands for cash too.

A coal company or a green company?

On the whole, it’s hard to see how the group can support all the ambitious expansion plans listed above. Barring dramatic improvements on the borrowing front – or a massive switch to domestic borrowing – the group will have to refocus on a few verticals, and cut capex plans elsewhere. It’s already rethinking plans to participate in the privatisation of Concor. One also wonders if the group will participate in the second round of the solar PLI.

Which is where the climate question comes in. Can the group support its clean energy projects? If not, can these businesses raise funds on their own?

CarbonCopy wrote to the Adani Group asking for an estimate of the investible surplus with the group. We also asked which parts of the business are likely to see capex cuts. This article will be updated when they respond.

In the meantime, it seems safe to assume that, in the short term, the group will have to focus on businesses with high returns. If a ₹100 invested in coal imports nets greater returns than those in Adani Green, the group might well invest more there.

In such a scenario, Adani Green will have to raise its own funds. The company’s financials, however, are strained. In FY22, the company had gross debt of Rs 48,171 crore against total income of Rs 5,577 crore and a net profit of Rs 489 crore. The downgrade from Moody’s won’t help. At a realistic valuation, how much fresh money can this company raise?

ANIL has an even bigger problem. Unlike Adani Green Energy, it’s a moonshot project. The group was hoping to raise some money for it through the FPO – but that was cancelled.

Now comes the news that TotalEnergies has put its investment into ANIL on hold. “This project was announced but nothing has been signed…. and for now it won’t be signed,” TotalEnergies chief executive Patrick Pouyanné told reporters on Wednesday. “It makes no sense to add more [projects] until there is clarity.”

The bigger picture

All of which brings us back to the question reporters asked cabinet minister Singh.

Will Adani’s current crisis hurt India’s clean energy goals? If the group fails to add 45 GW in renewables by 2030, India will indeed lose. And yet, the larger answer is no.

Over the past eight years, the Adani Group has been shoe-horned into an array of sectors instead of encouraging new market participants.

For the most part, this has been an inexplicable decision on the part of the Indian government. If Adani was to be groomed as a national champion as some say – like South Korean chaebols or Japan’s MITI – it has rushed ahead without empirically establishing whether the notion would work in India. According to academician Ashoka Mody, South Korea accompanied the chaebol strategy with large investments in public education. India hasn’t done that. Nor is it clear how or why Adani was chosen, not some other group.

“Adani is now active in solar module, gas, LNG, city gas, thermal, solar, hydrogen, ports and refineries,” an RE industry veteran in Hyderabad had told CarbonCopy last year. “Why are we not supporting new companies in each of these verticals?”

What India has today is a chance to roll that clock back. Take the solar PLI. If Adani doesn’t bid, another firm will bag the incentive. In all, if Adani is forced to shrink its presence in India’s “green growth” plans, it will likely be more of a blip rather than a death knell for the country’s ambitions. If the group is compelled to sell some of its relatively non-core businesses—like cement, steel, defence or road— to focus on a few verticals, what India will have seen is a short-seller driven anti-trust action.

It draws Walter Schneidel’s book on inequality to mind. It falls, he wrote, but only after a cataclysm.

Telegraph India,,Adani link makes poet decline award,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/adani-link-makes-poet-decline-award/cid/1915503,A poet in Tamil Nadu has declined to accept an award recognising women achievers because the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group.,None,Adani link makes poet decline award,"Sukirtharani told The Telegraph that associating herself with the programme would have been “antithetical to my principles, my body of writings and my philosophy for which I have stood so far”.

A poet in Tamil Nadu has declined to accept an award recognising women achievers because the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group.

Also an activist and teacher of Tamil at a government school in Ranipet district, Sukirtharani had been chosen for the Devi Awards by the organiser, The New Indian Express (TNIE) newspaper group. The event was held at a Chennai hotel on Wednesday and the awards were handed over by former top cop and Puducherry lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi.

This year’s edition of the Devi Awards was sponsored by the Adani group, the Vellore Institute of Technology and apparel brand Ahujasons, a report in The New Indian Express said on the event.

Sukirtharani’s decision to decline the award was reported by Justice News, an initiative of Peoples Media Advocacy & Resource Centre (PMARC), which seeks to bridge the divide between Dalit groups and mainstream media as well as civil society.

“I was among the 12 women personalities chosen for the Devi Awards-2023, organised by the TNIE, from across the country for their distinguished contribution in their respective fields of work,” Sukirtharani said.

“The selection was done by a team of experts. I respect their judgement. I wrote to them in an email thanking them for selecting me, but said I would not be able to accept the award as the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group,”Sukirtharani told this reporter over phone from her village near Ranipet.

Sukirtharani had been chosen for her contribution to Dalit literature. “I had initially agreed to accept the award, but it was only on February 3that I came to know that the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group,” she said.

Sukirtharani added: “Asa writer, I found it unacceptable to be associated with a function whose main sponsor was the Adani group as it is antithetical to my principles, my body of writings and my philosophy for which I have stood so far.”

Known for her bold and blunt style of writing, Sukirtharani, who was born in 1973 in a poor Dalit family and whose father worked as a daily wage-earner in a factory, drew attention to how the allegations of fraud in the Hindenburg Research report against the Adani group had disturbed her.

Besides, “the manner in which the group has been involved in developing the Kattupalli port (north of Chennai), taking over farmers’ lands and displacing rural labour, I do not agree with all these”, Sukirtharani said, adding that these were the reasons why “I declined the award”.

Sukirtharani has six collections of Tamil poetry and has received several awards like the Pudhumaipithan Memorial Award, the Women Achievers Award, the Avvai Award and the Vibrant Voice of Subalterns Award. Several of her poems feature in college curricula in Tamil Nadu and have been translated into English, Hindi, Malayalam, Kannada and German.

In an interview to the Indian Cultural Forum in September 2021, Sukirtharani had spoken about her activism. “The moment I set foot outside my house, caste chases me like a dog. Though official records say India has over six lakh villages, there are actually 12 lakh villages in all, because of the caste divide in each of them. The village I come from is also divided into two — the village proper and the Dalit area.... My social activism is motivated by the desire to unite these two divided sections.”

In August 2021, Delhi University’s Academic Council had unilaterally removed the writings of Sukirtharani and Bama alias Faustina Soosairaj from the English honours syllabus. DMK president and Tamil Nadu chief minister M.K. Stalin had condemned the move and said the removal of the writings was “blatantly partisan and completely unacceptable”.","A poet in Tamil Nadu has declined to accept an award recognising women achievers because the main sponsor of the event was the Adani group.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/gautam-adani-dismisses-share-price-rout-hindenburg,,None,Gautam Adani Dismisses Share Price Rout as 'Temporary' Volatility,"New Delhi: Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani Group, has dismissed as “temporary” volatility the rout in stock prices that has halved the company’s market value in the aftermath of a report released by US short-seller Hindenburg Research.

According to Financial Times, the business tycoon made these comments as Adani Enterprises on Tuesday, February 14 released its previous quarter’s earnings, posting a net profit of Rs 820 crore.

“The current market volatility is temporary; and as a classical incubator with a vision of long-term value creation, AEL will continue to work with the twin objectives of moderate leverage and looking at strategic opportunities to expand and grow,” Moneycontrol reported him as saying.

Adani Enterprises reported a net profit of Rs 820 crore for the October-December 2022 quarter, as against a loss of Rs 11.63 crore a year ago, the report said.

The company’s revenue from operations zoomed 42% to Rs 26,612.2 crore from Rs 18,757.9 crore last year.

“Over the past three decades, as well as quarter after quarter and year after year, Adani Enterprises has not only validated its standing as India’s most successful infrastructure incubator but has also demonstrated a track record of building a core infrastructure business,” he said.

On January 24, Hindenburg Research published a report alleging stock manipulation and fraud. The Adani Group has denied the allegations. However, the stock rout forced Adani to shelve a Rs 20,000 crore share sale that was intended to broaden its investor base.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India has told the Supreme Court that it was investigating the allegations made in the Hindenburg report.

Adani Enterprises was up by 1.91% to close at 1,750.30 a piece on the BSE on Tuesday. But Financial Times said that despite the recovery, the stock is still down about 45% since the short seller released its report on the Adani Group.

On the same day, five of the nine Adani Group stocks ended in the red. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone were up by 2.15%. Adani Power was down by 5%, Adani Transmission 5%, Adani Green Energy 4.99%, Adani Total Gas 5%, and Adani Wilmar 5%.

Embattled Adani group has appointed accountancy firm Grant Thornton for an independent audit of some of its companies in a bid to come clean of the damning allegations levelled by the U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research and to assure investors and regulators.

Sources said the audit is primarily to show to regulators like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that the group has nothing to hide and it is in compliance with relevant laws.

The audit will specifically look into if there was any misappropriation or repatriation of funds and if loans were used for any purpose other than the one they were intended for.

The audit, they said, would go a long way to show that the books are healthy and project executions are on track - something that the investors are keenly watching given the damage to market value that the Hindenburg report has caused.

As the run on its shares continued, Adani Group had on Monday attempted to calm the market, saying its growth plans are intact, business plans are fully funded and it remains confident of delivering returns to shareholders.

Market value of the group's seven listed companies has halved since the January 24 report by the U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that Adani pulled ""the largest con in corporate history"" using offshore tax havens and stock manipulation.

The group has denied all allegations, calling them ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"". It called Hindenburg the ""Madoffs of Manhattan"", referring to the late financier and fraudster Bernie Madoff.

""Balance sheet of each of our independent portfolio companies is very healthy,"" the group spokesperson had said. ""We have industry leading development capabilities, strong corporate governance, secure assets, strong cash flows, and our business plan is fully funded.""

The group debunked reports of a cut in growth goal and capex. Projects may be delayed but none is shelved or deferred and plans for expansion of solar, green hydrogen and airports were on track.

""Once the current market stabilizes, each entity will review its own capital market strategy, be rest assured, we are confident in the continued ability of our portfolio to deliver superior returns to shareholders,"" the spokesperson added.

The Adani crisis has sparked worries of financial contagion in India and ability to carry on infrastructure projects.

Last week, French oil major TotalEnergies said it would wait for the result of an independent audit before proceeding with investing in Adani Group's $50 billion plans to make green hydrogen.

According to Bernstein Research, Adani Green is capable of paying off all its debt of ₹22,000 crore due in the financial year ending in March 2025, if it divests some renewable energy assets, seeks fresh equity capital from existing investors, or cancels some planned projects and avoids bidding for new ones.

The spokesperson, however, termed questions over the group's ability to fund projects and refinance debt as 'unfounded speculation'.

Last week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the ratings outlook for four Adani group companies to negative from stable, while index provider MSCI said it would cut the weightage of some of its stocks in its indices.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the country's regulators are very experienced and are seized of the matter relating to the Adani Group crisis.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/politics/opposition-unites-on-adani-crisis-but-will-it-bring-in-votes,,None,"Opposition Unites on Adani Crisis, But Will it Bring in Votes?","The last few weeks have been a rollercoaster ride for the Union government because of the spirited unity displayed by the Opposition in Parliament over allegations of stock manipulation and fraud against the Adani Group, known for its proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Opposition parties put their differences aside and coordinated strategically to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee or a Supreme Court-monitored independent probe. While a few parties boycotted the House proceedings, others tactfully used the Budget Session to target the Union government for its failure to put the Adani group on a tight leash.

The fact that public sector units like LIC, SBI and other banks invested thousands of crores in the Adani group was projected by the Opposition as a striking instance of cronyism. At the same time, Opposition MPs questioned the role of regulatory bodies like SEBI in keeping a check on alleged illegal financial dealings of the Adani Group, even as they had been pointing out possible round-tripping and stock manipulation since 2019.

The political messaging was clear. For the last few years, the Opposition forces have accused the PM of promoting cronyism and have held the Union government responsible for a decline in the autonomy of top regulatory and investigative bodies. They found in the Hindenburg report an opportunity to strengthen their campaign against the Modi government in the run-up to 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

But can the Opposition sustain the momentum? Similar unity in their ranks was seen during the Pegasus exposé and farmers’ protests. Yet, as elections approached, the momentum fizzled out, while “Opposition unity” came crashing down in cases where two or more Opposition parties saw in each other better rivals than partners. In other instances, Opposition unity could not take concrete electoral shape despite a pre-poll alliance.

The SP-BSP alliance ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections turned out to be a paper tiger. The SP alleged that BSP could not transfer its votes to their candidates while SP supporters did well to honour the alliance. Before that, in the run-up to the 2017 UP Assembly polls, the Congress-SP alliance also turned out to be a disaster after the grand old party bargained shrewdly to corner 100 seats despite its negligible presence.

In the last Bihar Assembly polls, the Congress delivering its poorest strike rate despite having 50 seats to contest ― a factor that eventually prevented the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan from coming to power. In contrast, the smaller Left parties with pockets of influence settled for a smaller number of seats but delivered a commendable strike rate.

Similarly, in their quest to become national players, parties like TMC and AAP damaged the electoral prospects of the Congress in states like Goa, Haryana and Gujarat. The K Chandrashekar Rao-led Bharat Rashtra Samiti, which has been signalling a non-Congress front, may be a possible addition to the pool of Opposition parties which may put its national ambitions over any united fight that could upset the BJP applecart.

One reason for such dissonance among the Opposition parties is their historical trajectories. Most Lohiaite socialist parties fought the Congress and drew away a substantial chunk of traditional Congress supporters. The same is the case with southern parties like BRS, Janata Dal (Secular), Biju Janata Dal, or the Trinamool Congress. Their workers have created a niche by fighting the Congress, the biggest national party in the Opposition ranks, and continue to do so on the ground.

So last-minute pre-poll alliances tend to backfire, upsetting leaders and workers of different parties instead of strongly uniting them. The BJP has been able to take advantage of such contradictions, as could be seen in the large number of influential Opposition leaders switching over to the BJP in election run-ups. All such factors have helped the BJP improve its already dominant position, despite the Opposition raising timely and pertinent issues.

As the PM’s speech in the Motion of Thanks debate indicated, the BJP is quite clear that if it can contain the Congress that is its direct opponent in over 200 seats, other regional forces, however good their performance may be in 2024, may not be able to prevent yet another term for Modi.

For real electoral unity, the Congress and like-minded parties have to step beyond their personal ambitions. The Congress should be able to drop its big-brotherly posturing and pull back in favour of others in states where it has no realistic prospects, while others too have to back the Congress in states where it is the primary Opposition force.

There is no Opposition unity without the Congress, as much as there is no such thing without the regional forces. The thought of post-polls possibilities can’t in any way upend the pre-poll factors that need immediate attention. Parties like the RJD, JD(U), NCP, DMK, the Left parties, and even the Shiv Sena have set aside their historical differences with the Congress. Now, it is time for others to join the camp.

But for that to happen, unity needs to be more organic than before. Top Opposition leaders could surely unite, given the exigencies they face at the moment, but that may still draw a blank if they do not make efforts to bring their rank and file together on the ground, and accommodate them in the larger scheme of things.

Stocks bearing the Adani name appear in over 500 so-called Article 8 funds that are supposed to “promote"" ESG goals, provided that the companies in which the investments are made follow good governance practices under European Union rules, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

As many as 80 of those exposures are through direct holdings, while the remaining are mostly through funds of funds or index trackers, the data shows, which correct for duplicate holdings.

As the Adani Group companies get stripped from indexes and are put under review amid allegations of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation, ESG investors are once again left wondering why a strategy intended to shield against risks such as greenwashing and bad governance – often at an extra fee – didn’t protect them from the latest meltdown.

What are ESG funds

ESG funds are investments which make investment commitment based on environmental, social, and governance factors. A firm that makes investments in an ESG fund should be well-run and also have a positive impact on the environment and society as well.

Also, ESG funds seeks to benefit society and the environment while also producing financial returns.

ESG analysts believe that the strong headwinds faced by the Adani Group could impact access to offshore ESG-linked financing plans of other Indian firms.

An individual who tracks ESG investments has termed the Adani crisis as a bad omen for India’s green energy ambitions.

In the wake of a late January report by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research, the selloff in the Adani Group's seven listed subsidiaries have cumulatively lost about $120 billion in group market value in the last three weeks.

Funds with nearly $10 billion in assets under management tracking MSCI ESG indexes held shares in Adani Enterprises Ltd alone, as per an analysis by the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute. The institute has been studying the Adani Group since mid-2020.

In a report on Adani published on 9 February, Ulf Erlandsson, AFII’s chief executive officer, and Stephanie Mielnik, its head of fixed-income research, wrote: “Our view is that ESG investors with this unfortunate exposure should engage with their managers and, potentially, regulatory bodies that are better positioned to examine why this index-fund inclusion has occurred.""

Patrick Wood Uribe, the CEO of Util, an ESG research firm backed by private equity and venture capital investors, said the Adani debacle exposes some fundamental flaws in the approach adopted by several ESG index and ratings providers, as well as portfolio managers.

“There can be a very large mismatch with what investors are expecting,"" when they place their money in a company or a fund classified as ESG, Wood Uribe said in an interview. And by offering an “overly simplified view,"" ESG ratings end up doing a “disservice"" to investors, he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.

27% of Article 8 funds meet its sustainability requirement

In an effort to address such concerns, the European Securities and Markets Authority has proposed enforcing minimum thresholds that would require Article 8 managers to apply stricter standards to their ESG claims. A recent analysis by Morningstar Inc. found that if the ESMA proposal is adopted, only 27% of Article 8 funds would actually meet its sustainability requirement.

Adani companies were also held by 11 funds registered as Article 9, which is the EU’s highest ESG classification. Eight of these were through direct holdings, according to an analysis by Bloomberg. In order to justify an Article 9 designation under EU rules, a fund manager needs to prove that a portfolio is 100% sustainable, with allowances made for hedging and liquidity needs.

ESG fund managers are under “increasing pressure"" to be “much clearer with investors about what exactly they are offering and what it means,"" Util’s Wood Uribe said. There remains a “massive opportunity and a massive gap in actually meeting some of those sustainability objectives, actually delivering on what investors would like to see in terms of sustainable investment.""

Util also notes that Adani stock documents were replete with the kind of ESG verbiage that portfolio managers often look for. In its rebuttal of the Hindenburg report, Adani frequently cited the group’s adherence to ESG principles, and pointed to its adoption of multiple global ESG frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), among others.

Adani has denied all allegations, calling them ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"". It called Hindenburg the ""Madoffs of Manhattan"", referring to the late financier and fraudster Bernie Madoff.

ESG ratings firms, meanwhile, have given some corners of the Adani Group conspicuously high scores. Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Total Gas Ltd still carry an “A"" rating at MSCI Inc, according to data on the website of MSCI. Adani Transmission Ltd is rated “BBB.""

All three have lost more than a third of their value since the Hindenburg report was published. A spokesperson for MSCI said the firm is due to conduct a review of its ESG and climate indexes, which may include changes as early as this week.

“This is a conglomerate with operations in commodities, utilities, gas, and airports"" and one that is “engaged in some of the most controversial coal mining projects in recent history, including the largest open-pit coal mining operation,"" Wood Uribe said in a written analysis of the Adani group.

“Thanks to the ‘convoluted structures’ and ‘multiplicity of subsidiaries’ cited in the Hindenburg report, Adani has long been able to finance its dirtier operations with the proceeds of sustainable fund flows,"" he said.

Asia ESG funds global market share doubles

Meanwhile, in Asia, ESG funds have doubled their international market share as political and regulatory upheavals slow inflows for environmental, social and governance investing in the US and Europe.

Barclays Plc analysts including Dave Dai wrote in a note that Asia funds posted net inflows of 15% last year, as against 4% globally. That doubled Asia’s ESG fund market share to 4%, from 2% at the end of 2020, Barclays noted.

Asia’s net inflows into ESG stock and bond funds compared with 5% for non-ESG funds in the region, showing “stronger investor appetite for sustainable investing,"" the analysts further said.

With agency inputs","The crisis of India's second-largest conglomerate Adani Group run by billionaire Gautam Adani is turning into another bad milestone for environmental, social, and governance (ESG).
A firm that makes investments in an ESG fund should be well-run and also have a positive impact on the environment and society as well.
Also, ESG funds seeks to benefit society and the environment while also producing financial returns.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/politics/rahul-gandhi-modi-speech-adani-reaction,,None,"‘Clear That PM Is Protecting Adani’, Says Rahul Gandhi After Modi’s Speech","New Delhi: After Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at Rahul Gandhi during his speech in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, February 8, the Congress leader claimed that Modi was “shell-shocked” and did not reply to any of the questions he had raised about the BJP-led government’s alleged role in the meteoric rise of Gautam Adani.

During his reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, Modi dismissed the opposition’s criticisms of his government as “lies” and “false accusations” but did not mention Adani nor responded to the opposition’s demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee or Supreme Court-monitored probe into the Adani crisis. Gandhi had alleged on Tuesday in the Lok Sabha that Adani and Modi shared close links, saying it was a striking instance of crony capitalism.

Portions of Gandhi’s speech in which he linked Modi and Adani were expunged from the Lok Sabha’s record on Wednesday.

According to Indian Express, Gandhi claimed on Wednesday that the prime minister was “shell-shocked” and “there was no answer” to his questions. “The prime minister did not give a single answer. I had not asked any complicated questions. I had only asked how many times he [Gautam Adani] had travelled with you, how many times you had met him there. Those were simple questions but there were no answers,” the Congress leader said.

He added: “I am not satisfied. It reveals the truth. The (PM’s) speech shows the truth. There was no mention of inquiry. If he [Adani] is not his friend, then he should have said let’s have an inquiry.”

“There are shell companies, benami money is being circulated and the prime minister did not say anything,” Gandhi said, claiming, according to Indian Express, “It is clear the PM is protecting him [Adani].”

“This is a very big scam. He did not even say that. He [Modi] is surely trying to protect him [Adani] and I understand this and there are reasons for it,” the Wayanad MP said.

When he was asked about Prime Minister Modi’s statement that the people of the country trust him, Gandhi said:

“That is fine. What I am saying is that it is an issue related to national security, India’s infrastructure. The Prime Minister should have said that we will conduct an inquiry, we will get it checked, we will look into what happened. It is a big scam. But he didn’t. He was trying to protect him (Adani). I understand why, I know the reason.”

AICC general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh in a tweet claimed that the strategy behind prime minister’s “so-called reply” in parliament was to divert, defame, and denigrate”. He said: “Divert Defame Denigrate Deny. The 4 Ds in PM’s own style that Describe his so-called reply in Parliament. Not a word—direct or indirect—on the Prime Minister’s links with his favourite businessman, Adani, or his ghotalas!”","Portions of Gandhi’s speech in which he linked Modi and Adani were expunged from the Lok Sabha’s record on Wednesday.

This news became public a day after the National Stock Exchange put three Adani stocks – Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Ambuja Cements – under the additional surveillance measure. “There shall be Additional Surveillance Measures (ASM) on securities with surveillance concerns based on objective parameters viz. Price / Volume variation, Volatility etc,” NSE said on its website.

Stocks of the Gautam Adani-led Adani group have been crashing ever since the release of a damning report from short-seller Hindenburg Research, which accused the group of “pulling the largest con in corporate history” by engaging “in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades”.

“Adani Enterprises (XBOM: 512599) will be removed from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices following a Media & Stakeholder Analysis triggered by allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud,” the S&P Dow Jones Indices said, announcing this decision.

“S&P Dow Jones Indices will make the following changes to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, effective prior to the open on Tuesday, February 7, 2023,” the Index announcement added.

Controversy around the Adani group has been unravelling at a rapid pace over the last few days. On Wednesday, Adani Enterprises said it has decided to call off its fully subscribed Rs 20,000 crore ($2.5 billion) follow-on public offer (FPO).

Reports early on Thursday indicated that the Citigroup Inc.’s wealth arm has stopped accepting securities of Gautam Adani’s group of firms as collateral for margin loans, shortly after a similar decision by the Credit Suisse Group AG.

According to Livemint, Adani Enterprises share price on NSE has fallen from Rs 3,442 to Rs 1,565 apiece levels in the last six session, logging around 55% fall.","New Delhi: Amidst the ongoing controversy surrounding the company, Adani Enterprises will be removed from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices before February 7.

The Congress on Monday asked why the Narendra Modi government cannot agree to a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to probe the Hindenburg Research report’s allegations against the Adani Group if it could agree to set up a committee before the Supreme Court.

Party’s general secretary (communication) Jairam Ramesh, in a tweet, also asked if the proposed committee of experts would examine the New York-based Hindenburg Research or the Adani Group.

“Today in Supreme Court Solicitor General said Govt has no objection to a committee to examine the Hindenburg report on Adani. Then why the stubborn refusal to a JPC which will anyway be dominated by BJP & its allies? But will the proposed committee investigate Hindenburg or Adani?” asked Mr. Ramesh.

Separately, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote to Speaker Om Birla over the privilege notice served on former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi over his February 7 Lok Sabha speech and comments made against Mr. Modi.

Stating that the stock market crashed and thousands of crores of investors’ wealth got eroded because of the ‘wrong policies’ of the business house, Mr. Chowdhury said Mr. Gandhi fulfilled his duty as a ‘public representative’.

‘Public interest’

“The issue was raised in “public interest” and for the service of the nation,” Mr. Chowdhury said, adding that BJP leaders who make derogatory remarks against members of the Gandhi-Nehru family were “never admonished or reprimanded”.

In a related development, the Congress also posed a series of questions to Prime Minister Modi under the Hum Adani ke Hain Kaun series.

Mr. Ramesh alleged that as far back as 2007, the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), while conducting an investigation into the volatility of stocks of Adani Exports (now Adani Enterprise) had found that “entities associated with notorious stock manipulator Ketan Parekh (KP) had indulged in manipulative activities such as synchronised trading/circular trading and creation of artificial volume to influence the price in the scrip of Adani”.

“Why did SEBI tolerate an even more extreme rise in Adani Group stock prices after 2020 without investigating it with the required seriousness?” Mr. Ramesh asked, adding that “a close relative of Mr. Parekh may be still maintaining links with the Adani group.”

He further added that both Congress and BJP governments, in the past, have formed JPCs to probe stock manipulation. While the Harshad Mehta scam was investigated in 1992 by the Congress government, the Ketan Parekh manipulations were investigated in 2001 under a BJP government.

“What are you afraid of? Do you fear that a truly independent investigation might implicate you personally in the Adani Group’s wrongdoings?” asked Mr. Ramesh.

The issue of Adani Group was also raised in the Lok Sabha by Congress member Manish Tewari while speaking on power generation in Punjab and procurement of coal from the Mahanadi Coalfields during the Zero Hour.

“If that coal is brought directly to Punjab via rail road the distance that it has to travel is 1,830 km. The Power Ministry wrote a letter to the Punjab government on November 30, 2022, and said it cannot get the coal directly via rail road and will have to take the coal to Paradeep port, then take the water route passing by Sri Lanka and reach the Adani ports in Dahej and Mundra, and then from there take the coal 1,500 km via rail road to Punjab,” Mr. Tewari claimed.

Alleging discrimination against Punjab and its people to benefit the Adani Group, he added, ”The cost of coal transportation has gone up from ₹4,350 per tonne to ₹6,750 per tonne. The cost of 1KW power has increased from ₹3.6 to ₹5”.","Party’s general secretary (communication) Jairam Ramesh, in a tweet, also asked if the proposed committee of experts would examine the New York-based Hindenburg Research or the Adani Group.

Domestic indices edged higher, inspired by their global counterparts, as investors await the US inflation numbers today, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

""The whammy over India’s retail inflation breaching the RBI’s tolerance level was cooled by WPI inflation easing to 4.73 per cent in January. IT stocks were in focus as investors anticipated a slowdown in US inflation, which could result in favourable Fed policy,"" he said.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/fraud-is-fraud-hindenburg-replies-to-adani-groups-response,,None,'Fraud Is Fraud': Hindenburg Replies to Adani Group's Response,"New Delhi: After the Adani group’s 413-page response to Hindenburg Research on Sunday, claiming that the company had complied with all local laws and made the necessary regulatory disclosures, the short-seller replied by standing by all its original allegations. “…fraud is fraud, even when it’s perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world,” Hindenburg has said.

The short-seller highlighted that by stoking nationalist sentiments, the Adani group was in fact saying that billionaire Gautam Adani represented India as a whole – a claim the company should have no right to make:

“[Adani]…predictably tried to lead the focus away from substantive issues and instead stoked a nationalist narrative, claiming our report amounted to a “calculated attack on India.” In short, the Adani Group has attempted to conflate its meteoric rise and the wealth of its Chairman, Gautam Adani, with the success of India itself.

Rahul was speaking at a public meeting in Meenangadi panchayath stadium during a whirlwind visit to his MP constituency of Wayanad.

The Gandhi scion demanded to know how Adani can travel along with the prime minister on his foreign trips.

""I’ve hinted about the relationship between the prime minister and Adani in the parliament. I did not say anything offensive. How does Adani get to travel along with the prime minister during his foreign trips? How can Adani sign deals while in those countries? A major portion of my speech has been erased from the records. Rules have been tweaked for Adani. How is Adani buying all the airports in the country? Everything is based on his relationship with the prime minister. What I have said is nothing but the truth.

""The parliament secretary said I needed to provide proof for the claims made in my speech. I answered that everything will be given. The prime minister is personally insulting me. But I am not worried about that. I was asked why my name is Rahul Gandhi and not Rahul Nehru. He is fully aware that in India, people use the family name of the father. Modi may have all the agencies in his hand. But I do not fear him. One day Modi will have to face the truth,” he lashed out.

Earlier, Rahul Gandhi alleged in Lok Sabha that the growth of Gautham Adani is the only 'Modi Magic' that happened in the last eight years. He showed pictures of Modi and Adani travelling together during his scathing attack in the Lower House. ""The policy of the BJP government is to ensure one new deal for Adani during every foreign trip undertaken by the prime minister. Wherever Modi goes he takes Adani along with him, or Adani somehow reaches the places where the prime minister is going. Deals in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were signed like that,"" he charged.

Rahul also asked the ruling MPs if they could deny that 90% of the deals signed with Israel in the defense sector had been obtained by Adani. The BJP had filed a rights violation notice against this.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/with-the-adani-crisis-is-narendra-modis-house-of-cards-at-risk,,None,"With the Adani Crisis, Is Narendra Modi's House of Cards at Risk?","The Adani conglomerate, the business group most closely associated with Modi’s India, is under serious attack in the stock market, following a damning report by researchers at Hindenburg the outfit that specialises in short-selling overhyped tech stocks.

By early Friday morning New York time, Adani’s group had lost $51bn in value. This is a shocking blow to a business that is synonymous with the success story trumpeted by Delhi and the BJP leadership.

The slump in Adani shares follows breathtaking gains in recent years, including some of Asia’s biggest returns in 2022. The five-year advance in Adani Enterprises trumped even the likes of Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc., vaulting Adani from relative obscurity into the ranks of the world’s richest people.

It is hard to exaggerate Adani’s pivotal significance to the story of India’s rise. Founded in the 1980s as a commodity trading group, Adani has become a conglomerate of both national and global significance. In 2022 he crowned his rise to national prominence as “India’s businessman” by acquiring the three national channels of the NDTV television network.

As Bloomberg reported in September Adani’s rise has literally driven the indices.

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s ascent to rank as the world’s second-richest person has helped fuel a world-beating jump in the nation’s stocks and bolstered their clout among emerging-market equities. Eight firms controlled by Adani’s ports-to-power conglomerate, including recent cement acquisitions, have contributed more than a fifth of the 109-member MSCI India Index’s surge since end-June, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The index has outpaced Asian and emerging market peers during the period with a 12% jump.

Since 2020, the surge in Adani’s stock price has easily topped all of the madness in America’s equity markets.

As Mody makes clear in his forthcoming book, India is Broken, the rise of Gautam Adani is deeply connected not just with rise of Indian equity market but more specifically with Modi’s vision & the Gujarat connection. As the FT reported back in 2020. Adani’s firms own everything from ports to coal mines.

“Nation building” is Mr Adani’s motto and he likes to talk about helping India achieve energy security.

Adani’s reach extends beyond India to highly controversial mega coal projects in Australia. More recently, the Adani group has positioned itself at the forefront of India’s dramatic Green energy projects. As the Economist reports:

Gautam Adani, the group’s founder and chairman (whose personal fortune of well over $100bn makes him one of the world’s richest people), claims his companies will spend $70bn on greenery in India by 2030. With nearly 5gw of solar generation capacity as of mid-2021, Adani Green Energy, one of the group’s divisions, is already on par with Italy’s Enel Green as the world’s leading developer of solar energy.

At the same time as driving national infrastructure development, Adani personifies the oligarchic linkages and rentier profits generated by licensing system for infrastructure on which Modi’s growth model has heavily relied.

How to make sense of this political economy is one of the critical questions in India today. And what will be revealed by this attack on Adani?

The question of India’s new political economy was first posed in 2012 when analyst Ashish Gupta raised the alarm about bad debts at state banks. The issue was taken up by US-based economist Raghuram Rajan when he was appointed to the Reserve Bank of India in 2014. Rajan and his colleague at Chicago-Booth Luigi Zingales cast India’s problem as one of crony capitalism. Rajan as Reserve Bank Governor only until 2016.

Modi was elected in 2014 on a slate to overcome the corruption of the previous administration. But instead, the entanglement between the Gujurat business clique, headed by Adani and Ambani, and the Modi regime became ever more intense. So intense did it become that it escaped generic categories of corruption or cronyism and put in question the historic model of India’s development. As the FT noted back in 2020.

Some argue the concentration of economic power in family-run conglomerates is a way to fast-track India’s economic development, like the chaebol did for postwar South Korea. But critics say the rapid consolidation of state assets is creating monopolies and stifling competition. “Is India going to move towards the east Asian model or the Russian model? So far the tendency looks towards the latter [more] than the former,” says Rohit Chandra, assistant professor of public policy at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. “It’s not clear whether India’s concentration of capital will lead to the long-term benefit of Indian consumers.”

Rupa Subramanya writing in Nikkei Asia warned that India might be sliding from crony capitalism into something more akin to the gangster model of 1990s Russia. It takes courage for Indian journalists or activists to oppose the plans of the government-industrial and media complex. Rather than either South Korea or Russia, the other historic example that comes to mind, as the FT noted, are the Robber Barons of gilded age America.

Whether India’s industrialisation leaves it more closely resembling the US at the turn of the 20th century when the likes of oil magnate John D Rockefeller wielded vast influence, or Russia in the 1990s, Mr Adani’s voracious appetite for dealmaking and political instincts have ensured he will play a central role.

For a deep-dive on the structure of Indian political economy delve into the remarkable survey by Jairus Banaji published by the Phenomenal World at the end of 2022. Against a historical backdrop that sweeps back to independence, Banaji argues that the rise of groups like Adani signifies the fact that “the business families who formed the mainstay of industrial capitalism in the country for a whole three or four decades after Independence have either disintegrated or have been disintegrating and will soon cease to exist as coherent entities, let alone cohesive ones.”

Judged by sales Banaji sees three leading types of corporate capital in India today (whether publicly listed or privately held).

Adani clearly belongs amongst what Banaji calls the “New Capitalists” group, who as he notes are “the most fervent supporters of Prime Minister Modi. This is the case among both bigger groups (Ambanis, Adani, Sunil Mittal (Airtel), Anil Agarwal (Vedanta), the Hindujas, and Sudhir Mehta of the Torrent Group) and some smaller and less solid ones (e.g., the media tycoon Subhash Chandra who recently lost control of his flagships, with Zee Entertainment passing to Sony).”

Reading Banaji’s survey of December 2022 in light of events in January 2023 one can’t help wondering whether he does not understate the particular significance of the Adani-(Ambani)-Modi connection. Banaji’s focus, instead, is on correcting the simplistic critique of crony capitalism, which implies that India might instead enjoy a level playing-field of capitalist competition. Not only does this idealize relations between the state and capital elsewhere in the world. But, as he remarks, this side-steps the question of the “governance of capital” i.e. the relations internal to capital between management and shareholders. And, in particular, it fails to focus on the peculiarly Indian malaise of the promoters, figures like Gautam Adani, “either as a fraction of capital or as a class”. They are the key figures in the process through which old power blocs within the Indian capitalist class are dismantled and remetabolised. The new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016 has created an arena in which business groups with easy access to capital, amongst which the Adani’s figure prominently, can snap up the assets of ruined competitors.

But what if the biggest promoter-political-capitalist of all were to come under unsustainable pressure? It is not only inequality and power imbalances that are at stake, but the financial stability of the Indian economy.

Adani’s growth has been driven by a cycle between rising equity values and corporate debt. Already In 2014 Gautam Adani boasted that his deals were “immensely bankable”. And Wall Street has really begun to take a major interest since his turn to green energy.

The scale of this expansion set off alarm bells already years ago:

Credit Suisse warned in a 2015 “House of Debt” report that the Adani Group was one of 10 conglomerates under “severe stress” that accounted for 12 per cent of banking sector loans. Yet the Adani Group has been able to keep raising funds, in part by borrowing from overseas lenders and pivoting to green energy. “Groups that are perceived as politically connected can still tap the banks for loans,” says Hemindra Hazari, a Mumbai-based banking analyst.

Against this backdrop, the data in the Hindenburg report are both ominous and damning.

The report alleges that the stock values of the Adani Group and thus its ability to raise debt and leverage has been wildly inflated. A valuation of the group at levels more typical of the market and the sectors that it is in, would imply a spectacular devaluation.

The Hindenburg report traces the mechanisms and personal networks through which stock values have been boosted by a group of circular, inside equity stakes:

Were Adani to find itself in real trouble, there can be little doubt that the real anchor would be the state. Adani’s rise and the fortunes of Modi and the BJP are closely tied.

Unsurprisingly, the opposition Congress party has leapt on the Adani issue. As The Print reports, Party leader Jairam Ramesh has issued a statement.

“State-owned banks have lent twice as much to the Adani group as private banks, with 40 per cent of their lending being done by SBI,” Ramesh said. “This irresponsibility has exposed the crores of Indians who have poured their savings into LIC and SBI to financial risk.”

Congress’s standing is so weak that it is unlikely to pose a real threat. A more serious risk is that the panic spreads from Adani throughout the financial markets, forcing the Modi administration to make painful choices. As Bloomberg reports the shock and anxiety is catching especially amongst global investors who may swiftly reevaluate their weighting of Indian assets.

“The issues strike at the heart of the Indian corporate sector scene where a number of family-controlled conglomerates dominate,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. “By their very nature they are opaque, and global investors have to take on trust the issues of corporate governance.” “After last year’s stellar performance, Indian equities and any high-profile company’s shares are open to downside risk of profit-taking,”

How big the risk to the Indian banking system actually is, is disputed. The CLSA brokerage points out that much of Adani’s debt is in the form of bonds and private Indian banks are on the hook only for a small fraction of its bank borrowing. But contagion is not just a matter of facts and figures. It is a matter of overall risk appetite. Worryingly, on Friday 27 as the depth of the collapse in confidence sank in, the contagion spread to the financial sector. Shares of Indian banks and Life Insurance Corp. of India plunged on Friday.

In 2019, ahead of COVID, India was sometimes describes as a developing country suffering from rich-country banking problems. COVID displaced those concerns to the margins. With the crisis at Adani issues of financial stability come very much back to the fore. Adani’s group has been at the very forefront of the good news narrative that has yielded a series of decisive election victories for Prime Minister Modi. As Mihir Sharma points out, the Indian public is under few illusions about the extent of corruption and feather-bedding, what they expect from the likes of Adani and Ambani is delivery. But that depends on preserving at least a veneer of financial probity and stability. If the panic spreads, if there are huge losses to be absorbed, it is an open question which balance sheet will absorb the damage.

We don’t know what will come next. What we do know is that on Friday 27 January 2023 Gautam Adani suffered the worst financial blow ever experienced by an Asian billionaire. An ill-timed $2.5 billion share sale by the Adani group meant to fund capital expenditures and to pay down the debt of its various units, hangs in the balance. And much more besides. Under intense external pressure, will the Gujarat clique hold together? Will Delhi stay loyal to Adani? If it comes to a bailout will oppositional forces in India go along? What price will Modi pay? What might a dog-fight within the BJP-oligarch cabal look like?

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/with-hindenburg-adani-faces-his-stiffest-challenge-yet,,None,"With Hindenburg, Adani Faces His Stiffest Challenge Yet","On January 25, Hindenburg Research released its report on the Adani Group.

Its contents are well-known by now. The US-based short-selling firm – with the scalps of firms like electric vehicle startup Nikola – accused the Indian conglomerate of serious malfeasances like the use of offshore investment funds and tainted brokers to boost both share prices and group earnings.

As this article gets written, there is speculation about how the report will affect the Adani group. What is certain is the impact may run significantly deeper than the huge Rs 400,000 crore drop in the group’s market capitalisation by the evening of January 27.

With growth, the group’s borrowing strategy has changed. By 2019, it had begun looking beyond domestic banks, tapping funds from overseas, mostly in the form of bonds, instead. That year, trying to understand how the group was financing its quicksilver expansion, this reporter had interviewed a highly-placed finance executive at the group.

Bank funding has been quite constrained the last three years, the executive said in that discussion. For the next five to ten years, he had said, the global bond market will be the most important source of funds for the group. In a subsequent email statement, the company’s spokesperson had said the same. “Global capital market is among the largest sources of funding for the group which has been part of a focused effort to reduce reliance on the banking sector.”

This shows in the numbers. By October 2021, the group had become the biggest issuer of offshore bonds from India. In December 2022, in his interview to India Today, group chairperson Gautam Adani said Indian banks’ share in the group’s total lending is just 32%. “Almost 50% of our borrowing is now through international bonds,” he said.

This is where Hindenburg enters the picture. The short-seller is not going short – betting a firm’s stock will lose value – on Adani’s shares. Instead, it’s focusing on international bonds. It holds, as its report said, “short positions in Adani Group Companies through U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivatives, along with other non-Indian-traded reference securities”.

The announcement landed a punch. By Friday evening, dollar bonds of Adani Group had fallen to 77 cents to the dollar.

What does that mean? In a general sense, future bond issues by a company whose bonds are shedding value might find fewer takers. Alternately, it might have to pay higher interest to attract investors.

In the case of Adani, the consequences are worth noting.

A closer look at Adani

Here is what we know about Adani.

Before 2014, the group had most of its operations in Gujarat.

Since then, however, the group has posted an extraordinary expansion across the country – not only entrenching itself in the sectors where it was already present (like ports and power) but also carving out a strong market position in newer sectors like airports, renewables, cement, defence, data centres, agriculture and others.

This expansion has been a puzzle. Studying the group’s expansion in 2018 – a randomly chosen year – this reporter found the group had announced future expenditure of Rs 167,000 crore that year alone, despite its net profit standing at just Rs 3,455.34 crore.

How has the organisation managed such growth? Trying to answer that question, this reporter had found an arrangement where the group floated new companies, pledged their shares to raise money, and then deployed those funds across the group – to shore up struggling firms; and as equity to start more new firms.

The value of these shares, says Hindenburg, is inflated. A clutch of investment funds with controversial managers based in tax havens have invested almost entirely in Adani companies. Its report supports Indian media reports that these funds were being used to drive up Adani shares.

.@AdaniOnline CFO, Jugeshinder Singh, has labelled the Hindenburg Research report as malicious and unsubstantiated with the malafide intention of damaging Adani Enterprises’ upcoming FPO. Read: https://t.co/7tHjNAdJ3S pic.twitter.com/k2eInezNMV — BQ Prime (@bqprime) January 25, 2023

The second factor is group architecture. “Adani´s key 7 listed companies have a total of 578 subsidiaries,” writes Hindenburg, “some of which are incorporated in notoriously opaque jurisdictions including Mauritius, Panama and the UAE.” These companies, says the short-seller, move money onto the “listed companies’ balance sheets in order to maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency”.

Given this arrangement, one question comes up. How does the group use the money it raises through bonds? According to one media report, the group uses bonds to swap “existing high-interest debt with lower-cost borrowings and deploy(s) the rest for project financing”.

And yet, in the past, Adani has pushed borrowed money to other parts of the group as well. For this reason, the implications of Hindenburg’s short-selling might have deeper impacts on the group. Whether Adani’s fund-raising through bonds falters – or requires larger interest payments – the group will be more constrained for money.

What that means for the group will become clearer in the weeks and months ahead.

The larger question about systemic failure

As things stand, these events call SKS Microfinance to mind.

In 2010, the MFI, headed by founder Vikram Akula, listed on stock markets without preparing for the accompanying higher requirements on governance and disclosure. Shortly after listing, Akula abruptly fired his CEO and found himself saddled with a debate about governance standards at the company.

Adani is seeing something similar. Take the investment funds which hold Adani stock. Not only do these hold most of Adani’s free float, some are also managed by controversial individuals.

Alastair Guggenbühl-Even, Monterosa’s Chairman and CEO, has connections with fugitive Indian diamond merchant, Jatin Rajnikant Mehta. Elara Capital has a connection, via Dharmesh Doshi, with Ketan Parekh. Cyprus-Based New Leaina Investments is managed By Amicorp Group, which was implicated in Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal.

Our response to Adani: pic.twitter.com/6NcFKR8gEL — Hindenburg Research (@HindenburgRes) January 26, 2023

As Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee wrote: “If Hindenburg is right, then a network of shadowy operators… is exerting outsize influence over India’s markets from overseas in cahoots with corporate honchos back home.”

This process has gone unchallenged by India’s regulators. This abdication in duty is seen in other parts of India’s capital markets architecture as well. Take the now-disgraced Brickwork Ratings. It normalised Adani’s use of borrowed funds as equity.

What this shows is a capital market regulatory framework that is mostly optics. “Regulated entities tick much the same boxes they would in a developed market,” wrote Mukherjee. “As in the West, a growing number of these requirements deal with corporate governance. But scratch the surface of disclosures and unsavory characters show up.”

That is the bigger point here. Weak regulation has allowed Adani to grow unchecked. But now, poor regulators – and the company’s own decisions – have also created room for the entry of a short-seller who thinks the company’s shares are overvalued by 85%.

What happens next

Hindenburg might not be working alone.

As NYMag wrote in its profile of Nathan Anderson, who founded the short-selling firm, “For each investigation, he may take on one backer. The investor gets an advance look at the report that allows that party to take a short position, and Hindenburg takes a cut of the profits on the trade.”

In that sense, we do not know how big a position the short-sellers have taken. In Nikola, they had taken over as much as 43% of the public float. Two years later, the company’s shares were 71% down – with short sellers betting they could fall yet lower.

In the case of Adani, one variable now is the FPO. If it goes through, it will improve the group’s debt-equity numbers – and give lenders greater comfort. Much also depends on when existing bonds come up for redemption. At that time, the group will have to refinance them.

Adani Group says @HindenburgRes’ allegations regarding:

The group has to regain the global bond market’s confidence or look for alternatives. More domestic borrowings is one possibility but, as The Morning Context reported, there is not much interest among domestic institutions. The group could also consider tapping sovereign funds. It isn’t clear, however, if those can entirely replace the global bond market.

If bond prices fall steeply, the group could also consider re-acquiring them but that is unlikely. Adani group’s total gross debt last year stood at Rs 2.2 lakh crore. With half of this coming from overseas bonds, that is Rs 1.1 lakh crore. Not an easy sum to raise while running the group as well.

One waits and watches.","On January 25, Hindenburg Research released its report on the Adani Group.

The comments were part of a credit report aimed at reassuring investors.

3.9% on a QoQ basis, with volume growth across all the segments and good progress to gain market share across key product categories. Growth was driven by the extension of distribution networks, an increase in direct reach across urban and rural markets, and excellent execution in alternate channels.""

The brokerage went on to add that alternative channels such as E-commerce, Modern Trade, and eB2B have continued to grow at a much faster rate, owing to a shift in customer behavior.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/elara-adani-group-defence-firm-co-owner,,None,Mauritius-Based Key Investor in Adani is Also Co-Owner of a Group Defence Firm: Report,"New Delhi: Elara India Opportunities Fund – one of the four Mauritius-based funds that hold shares predominantly in Adani Group firms – is a promoter entity in a defence company that has a Rs 590-crore contract with the Union government, the Indian Express reported on March 15, Wednesday.

Elara IOF is a venture capital fund managed by Elara Capital.

Bengaluru-based Alpha Design Technologies Private Limited (ADTPL), incorporated in 2003, works closely with the Indian Space Research Organisation and Defence Research and Development Organisation. It was reportedly acquired by the Adani Group in 2019. But, the Indian Express report says, Elara is a co-owner along with the Adani Group.

In its January 24 report, among other allegations, US-based short seller Hindenburg Research said that three funds, including Elara, engaged in circuitous trading and market manipulation of the Adani group stocks, the Morning Context reported.

Another report by the news outlet in 2021 had said that 97% of Elara IOF’s net worth comes from Adani companies. The Indian Express noted that even after significantly reducing its share over the last three years, its holdings in three Adani firms add up to over Rs 9,000 crore or over 96% of its total corpus in December 2022.

As of December 31, 2022, Elara IOF holds 1.6% of Adani Enterprises, 3.62% of Adani Transmission, and 1.62% of Adani Total, the IE report said.

According to a CARE Ratings press release in January 2021, ADTPL is a subsidiary of Adani Defence.

Ownership details

A spokesperson of the Adani Group told the daily that the largest promoter in ADTPL is Vasaka Promoters & Developers. However, the records cited by the Indian Express reveal that Adani Group and Elara together own a majority stake (51.65%) in the Bengaluru-based company.

“In 2017, Adani Defence was looking for companies which can provide both defence electronics as well as aero-structures capabilities in India. Alpha Design Technologies had capabilities across both electronics as well as aerostructures.”

“Adani Defence invested in ADTL in 2018… Adani Defence had taken a 26 per cent stake and had invested primary funds to grow the company to the next level. Elara India Opportunities Fund has a minority stake of 0.53%. The largest promoter is Vasaka Promoters & Developers,” the spokesperson told the daily.

However, the newspaper, citing Registrar of Companies records, said that Elara IOF bought a 44.3% stake in Vasaka for Rs 40 crore, and became the single largest shareholder on November 5, 2018.

“Elara IOF also bought 0.53% directly in ADTPL for Rs 7.62 crore on December 1, 2018. In effect, Elara IOF holds almost 26% (25.65%) in ADTPL,” the report said.

On December 13, 2018, Adani Defence invested Rs 400 crore to acquire 26% of ADTPL. “This valued the company at about Rs 1,538 crore. Thus, Adani and Elara together own 51.65%, i.e., a majority stake in ADTPL,” it added.

Later, the company made Adani Defence a promoter along with Vasaka – in which Elara IOF is the single largest shareholder with 44.3% stake – and Colonel H.S. Shankar.

Vasaka Promoters and Developers was incorporated in 1995 and in 2006. Its shareholding has changed since then.

At the end of March 31, 2022, Vasaka’s shareholding was: Elara IOF (44.3%), Amarjit Singh Bakshi-founded Safdarjung Estates (22.38%), Amarjit Singh Bakshi (1.38%), A.R. Murugappan (7.99%) and M. Subramaniam (7.99%), Wellness Charitable Trust (15.97%).

Murugappan and M. Subramaniam have been the company’s shareholders since the beginning.

As on March 31, 2022, ADTPL’s shareholding stood at: Vasaka 56.57%, Adani Defence 26%, Col Shankar: 0.019%, Elara IOF 0.53%, One Earth Capital 10.3% and Alpha Design ESOP Trust 5.8%.

Commenting on the report, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said, “India’s missile & radar upgrade contract is given to a company owned by Adani & a dubious foreign entity called Elara.”

A history of wrong bets

Firstpost reported in 2018 that Elara and two other funds have been subject to at least one probe for alleged round-tripping. Under this process, considered illegal in India, money is transferred typically to a shell company before being returned, giving the impression the funds originate from a clean source. Indian authorities struggled to identify who ultimately controls the money, according to the report.

The report said that Elara India Opportunities Fund, along with other two funds, invested in companies whose founders fled India and are allegedly being probed for money laundering.

In 2018, as per the Firstpost report, the Enforcement Directorate examined Elara India, and other two funds, Cresta and Albula, as part of the Sandesara investigation to identify the ultimate beneficiary of the money.

Data from the social media analytics platform Social Blade shows that the follower count of Hindenburg Research jumped by nearly 2.5 lakh in the last one month with the total count now pegged at nearly 4.5 lakh.

Interestingly, the research firm joined Twitter in July 2017 but there was not much of traction in terms of following as the official handle of the research firm that takes short positions in firms before releasing a report typically gained an insignificant number of followers every month.

The trend registered a huge spike in January with nearly 2 lakh new followers – it had gained a paltry 193 new followers in December 2022.

The activity level also shot up post the release of the report on the Adani Group – which led to the group’s market capitalisation eroding by over $100 billion in a matter of days – as the Twitter handle posted extracts from its report quite frequently – often more than a few times every day.

While there were many tweets – all related to its report on Adani Group -- posted on January 25, the last tweet prior to those were posted on January 9 that was followed by tweets on December 7, 2022.

Similarly, the follower count of Anderson whose Twitter handle is @ClarityToast, also jumped by more than 17,000 in the last one month, with the total follower count pegged at nearly 44,000.

While Anderson calls his Twitter handle a “personal account”, all his tweets are related to reports of Hindenburg. Further, the jump in his follower count has mirrored the trend of Hindenburg's handle with January seeing the count at nearly 7,000 even as December saw his follower count move up by only 430.

Post the release of the report on Adani Group, Anderson has mostly tweeted/retweeted media reports that support the findings of Hindenburg.

Meanwhile, going by the publicly-available data on its site, the research firm that claims to unearth “man-made disasters floating around in the market” has released reports on more than 15 companies till date starting in 2017.

While Indian business conglomerate Adani Group is its latest target, the firm was most active in the year 2020 even as there was a global lockdown on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The research firm earlier released scathing reports on companies like Nikola, WINS Finance, China Metal Resources Utilization, SC Worx, Predictive Technology Group, SmileDirectClub, and Yangtze River Port & Logistics among others.

More importantly, the research firm always takes a short position – designed to profit from a fall in the stock price -- in the company before releasing a report.

Should Gautam Adani take a business tip from Vallabh, an amiable young man who owns and runs a small eatery in Panjim, Goa?

In 1988 Gautam Adani founded Adani Enterprises which, in the span of 34 years, registered a meteoric rise that made him the third richest man in the world.

Then last month, out of the blue, came a devastating lightning bolt. A US-based short seller called the Hindenburg Research accused the Adani empire of all manner of financial skulduggery, including stock manipulation and fraudulent accounting, which torpedoed the conglomerate’s market valuation. Adani lost 50% of his wealth in 10 days, and fell from being the third richest man on the planet in January to the 17th richest in early February, practically a pauper in relative terms.

The Adani group has rebutted all charges of wrongdoing on its part, and has countered by saying that outfits like the Hindenburg Research make money by ‘short selling’, bringing down the value of a company’s shares, then offloading the cut-price stock at a profit, and as such their alleged findings are suspect.

But could there be a different reason behind the Adani meltdown? Has the group – which has fingers in pies as varied as coal and oil exploration, to airports and road building, to cement manufacture and financial services – diversified too much, too rapidly?

If so, Adani should look at the business model on which Vallabh runs his hugely successful Ashok Restaurant in Panjim, an establishment started by his father in 1954, and which has just one item on its menu: xacuti, the coconut-flavoured Goan curry. Customers can choose between chicken or mutton xacuti, take it or leave it. And customers take it, so much so that Vallabh shuts shop by early evening, having run out of supplies.

Vallabh’s wife mixes the spices, and Vallabh does the cooking, to produce what many claim is the best xacuti in the whole of Goa.

Vallabh’s tip for Adani? Stick to one thing, stick to your core competence. Stick to your knitting. Or your xacuti.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/analysing-the-adani-debacle,,None,Analysing the Adani Debacle,"It comes close to a fairytale as one starts narrating the meteoric rise and fall of the Adani Group in terms of its changing fortunes or valuations in the market. I think history will reckon this as a singular event, at least for India, given the scale as well as the velocity of the changes – both during the spectacular ascent as well as in the downhill path ever since Hindenburg Research, a short seller agency, levelled serious accusations about the use of wide-ranging illegalities by the group.

The speedy route to the top

The road to success began in 1999, with Adani as a trader of imported palm oil in collaboration with Wilmar of Singapore. Seven key companies of the Adani group very quickly acquired ownership of most of India’s infrastructure assets – including seaports, highways, airports, data storage, defence supplies and even jewellery. The Adani Group’s valuation, according to Hindenburg Report, was at $218 billion, with Gautam Adani’s share at $120 billion, mostly through share price escalation, i.e. market evaluation, since 2020.

All this leaves us with the big question as to how, on earth, the rise was made possible. And then what all were behind the fall, just like a pack of cards, as several people have remarked.

The actual rise

The rise of the Adani conglomerate was possible with the help of publicly owned financial institutions. Those included, first, loans from publicly owned institutions (SBI and LIC plus others like PNB) which seemed to have readily complied by using the high-priced (or overvalued) shares as collateral. Funding infrastructure projects mostly amounted to acquisitions of assets having long gestation periods and not greenfield projects.

Almost 75% of loans taken by the Group were from foreign banks and markets abroad and inflated stock prices would have greatly helped in being able to pledge shares as collateral.

With small or negligible sums obtained from equities and mutual funds, the ratio of debt to equities crossed the safe limit of 2:1. The high value of the collateralised shares were allegedly manipulated by using undisclosed shell companies – most probably owned by the conglomerate, as the Hindenburg Research report suggests. Those possible manipulations could have ended up working as the second channel of funding for the Adanis.

Operations in stock trading gave a third opportunity of gathering money. Use of margins provided unofficial credit sources. While generally open, those channels, if allegations are to be believed, may have proved more lucrative for the Adanis by dint of the sheer scale of their operations.

The rising turnover, made possible, adds to capitalisation and further profits. These routes could have provided lucrative business for the business tycoon.

Fragile edifice versus real expansion

That the edifice was rather fragile was the main accusation levelled by the Hindenburg Report on January 24 this year, which the Adani Group has strongly denied. But there has been a loss in Adani’s wealth, down from $120 billion on January 24 to below $50 billion less than a month later.

Financial gains booked in the market on transactions do not originate from productive activities in the real economy. Thus stock market prosperity, as can be evidenced, does not necessarily generate real growth. If new stocks are sold in the primary market, those generate demand for real investments. However, when the same (old) stocks are resold in the secondary market, no contributions are made to real investments, even by pushing up the prices of stocks. Thus profits (capital gains) on the sale of old stocks relating to a firm (in the secondary market) do not necessarily lead to higher prices of new stocks and to their demand, as such stocks are launched by the firm. The mere expectations of higher stock prices generate larger demand in the stock market.

The Adani Group’s steady advances were transmitted to India’s major stock exchanges over the last two decades. But the gains remained within the financial circle, often reinvested in financial assets for speculation. The journey of the financial circuit, subject to market confidence, continued along a concentric circle which widened with rising asset prices, asset incomes and capital gains.

Asymmetry in downturn

However, there remains an asymmetry and financial sector disruptions do have some impact on the real sector and real economy. The explanation lies in the dual exposures of the real economy to the financial sector assets. First, with a drop in prices of financial assets held by the real sector having a second-round impact (wealth effect) via reduced real demand in the economy. Second, at a micro level, a proportionate decline in the net asset value for financial institutions having a similar effect.

Linked to the rising exposure of the real economy to the financial, there is evidence that the ongoing spate of output contractions and job losses in India as well as in different parts of the world does take place in the case of recurring financial crises.

Control fraud?

Let us get back to the notion of “Control Fraud” by the CEO or other “super-predators of the financial world”, in William Black’s classic book The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One. The four privileges CEOs ostensibly enjoy include “suborn internal and external controls and pervert them into allies” (for example, to “shop” for an auditor that will aid their looting). The second is to “optimise the company by having it invest primarily in assets that have no readily ascertainable market value”. Third: “CEOs … to convert company assets into personal funds through seemingly legitimate corporate mechanisms.” Fourth, their unique ability to “influence the external environment to aid”.

Does not the above serve as a sketch of what has just happened in India?

New Delhi, February 17

Billionaire philanthropist George Soros believes the turmoil at Gautam Adani's business empire may weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modi's hold on the government - a statement which was strongly countered by BJP as an attack on Indian democracy.

Adani group has been under severe pressure since the US short-seller Hindenburg Research on January 24, accused it of accounting fraud and stock manipulation, allegations that the conglomerate has denied as ""malicious"", ""baseless"" and a ""calculated attack on India"".

While listed companies of the group lost over USD 125 billion in market value in three weeks, opposition parties inside and outside Parliament attacked the BJP government for the meteoric rise of the ports-to-energy conglomerate. Stocks of most group firms have risen in the last couple of days.

Soros, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Thursday, said Modi would ""have to answer questions"" from foreign investors and Parliament on allegations the Adani group is facing.

His speech drew sharp reactions. Ruling BJP said Soros was not only targeting the Prime Minister but also the Indian democratic system. This war is being mounted against India and what stands between the war and India's interests is Modi, BJP leader and Union minister Smriti Irani told reporters. ""Everyone should condemn his remarks in one voice"".

Soros in his speech said the turmoil at Adani may open the door to a democratic revival in the country.

His near 42-minute speech oscillated between climate change, Russia-Ukraine war, rumbling in the US, Turkey disaster and failures in China.

""Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies; their fate is intertwined,"" he claimed. ""Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards. Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in Parliament."" He did not offer any evidence for his claim.

""This will significantly weaken Modi's stranglehold on India's federal government and open the door to push for much needed institutional reforms,"" he said. ""I may be naïve, but I expect a democratic revival in India."" His comments drew sharp reaction from the ruling establishment.

Kanchan Gupta, senior adviser to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said the faces behind repeated regime change stands exposed.

""Face behind repeated 'regime change' attempts in India with collaborators paid by The Open Society Foundations stands exposed.

India's enemies are many: George Soros leads the pack.

Democracy in India is strong, resilient. 2024 is not too far away and Soros will eat crow again,"" he tweeted, attaching news of Soros' comments.

Gupta went on to state that the Munich Security Conference (MSS) was a platform for discussing global security challenges and seeking paths to peace and stability, not conflict.

""Soros being given a platform to share his subversive 'regime change' agenda to undermine India tells a different story about MSS,"" he said.

The 92-year-old investor started his speech at the conference talking of understanding the current state of affairs and finding a way to distinguish what is important from what is less so.

""Let me start with a bold assertion. While two systems of governance are engaged in a fight for global domination, our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change.

""This is a very succinct statement, but I believe it provides an accurate summary of the current state of affairs,"" he said, devoting a good deal of his speech on climate change.

He then stated that as the founder of Open Society Foundation, he considers open societies ""morally superior"" to closed ones.

At this point, he talks of repressive states and distinguishes between open and closed societies.

""India is an interesting case. It's a democracy, but its leader Narendra Modi is no democrat,"" he claimed.

Modi, he said, maintains close relations with both open and closed societies.

""India is a member of the Quad (which also includes Australia, the US, and Japan), but it buys a lot of Russian oil at a steep discount and makes a lot of money on it,"" he said before turning to Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.

""Erdogan has much in common with Modi,"" he said. ""But, while Modi seemed to be firmly in the saddle until recently, Erdogan has mismanaged the Turkish economy and will face elections in May. All his efforts are focused on winning the elections."" Soros thereafter talked about how Erdogan was ""autocratic"", his attempts to jail opponents and the government's slow response to the massive earthquake in Turkey.

He then made the comments on Modi and his links with Adani before moving on to other countries like Brazil, Russia and its conflict with Ukraine, US president Joe Biden's role in the war and finally to China.

""Turning to China, Xi Jinping would be an obvious loser. His close association with Putin would hurt him. But China may be already undergoing a revolution,"" he said, adding Xi's Zero Covid policy was his biggest blunder.

After devoting time on talking about what ails China, he turned to the US saying democracy isn't functioning ""very well"".

""When Donald Trump became president in 2016, he posed a real threat to our democracy,"" he claimed. ""Trump is a deeply flawed character, a confidence trickster whose narcissism grew into a disease."" He hoped that in 2024 Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida would ""slug it out for the Republican nomination"".

""To conclude, I want to repeat what I said at the beginning: while open and closed societies are in a fight for global domination our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change. I believe this sums up the current state of affairs accurately,"" he added.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/concerns-over-adani-companies-being-listed-on-nse-indices,,None,Concerns Over Adani Companies Being Listed on NSE Indices,"New Delhi: Ten days ago, National Stock Exchange (NSE) Indices added five Adani group companies – Adani Total Gas, Adani Enterprises, Adani Wilmar, Adani Power and ACC – to 14 Nifty indices. Financial experts have now asked the NSE board, as well as regulator SEBI, to look into this move, The Hindu reported. With these companies being added to the indices, they said, lack of investors’ savings could go into the companies’ sinking stocks.

On January 24, US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report alleging widespread accounting fraud and stock manipulation in Adani group companies. Further investigations since have also revealed possible wrongdoing within the company. Adani group share prices have been in freefall ever since the Hindenburg report was released.

The Adani group has denied the allegations made by the short-seller, even saying that any such accusations are an attack on India as a whole.

“The NSE’s most popular market benchmark, the Nifty 50, already includes Adani Ports and SEZ and Adani Enterprises. Following this review, the number of Adani group stocks in the Nifty Next 50 and the Nifty 100 will rise to six and eight, respectively. Adani Enterprises, which was already part of the Nifty 100, has been added to the Nifty 100 Liquid 15 index,” The Hindu reported.

NSE Indices told the newspaper that these decisions were made based on “objective stock selection criteria” that are mentioned on its website.

“As mentioned in the [methodology] document, review of broad market indices is undertaken semi-annually based on data for six months ending January and July each year. As part of semi-annual periodicity, Index Maintenance Sub-Committee conducted a review of broad market and other category of indices based on data for six months ending January 31, 2022 and replacements in various indices in accordance with stock selection criteria…,” the NSE subsidiary said.

The decision will be applied from March 31. However, given the way stock prices for all Adani companies have been falling, financial experts believe it should be reviewed before implementation. “There is an urgent need for the NSE’s board of directors to take stock of this unusual situation and consider a review of the indices and their associated provisions, and related issues,” Jaimini Bhagwati, a financial sector expert who had handled the capital markets division at the finance ministry, told The Hindu.

“While index providers like NSE Indices follow objective criteria like market capitalisation and free float to determine stock selection, they must undertake a critical review of stocks like MSCI is doing. One can’t be blind to the sharp volatility and decline in stock prices seen over the past month,” Raghavendra Nath, managing director at Ladderup Wealth Management Private Limited, added.

The MSCI, a global index provider, is currently reviewing the inclusion of some Adani group companies and has reduced their “free float” weightages.","New Delhi: Ten days ago, National Stock Exchange (NSE) Indices added five Adani group companies – Adani Total Gas, Adani Enterprises, Adani Wilmar, Adani Power and ACC – to 14 Nifty indices.

The sealed envelope had suggestions for the committee that the apex court had advised the government to create in order to look into the fall in Adani Group stocks following the Hindenburg Research report, and recommend improvement in statutory and regulatory regimes.

The apex court stated that “true facts” should come out from the expert panel without impacting stock markets. The advice to form the committee came from two PILs that were filed in the Supreme Court in the Adani-Hindenburg case.

""We don't want sealed cover suggestions. Even if we don't accept your suggestions, the other side will have the impression that we accepted the government-adopted committee. I want to have complete transparency. We will appoint our own committee and a sense of trust should be there,"" said CJI Chandrachud on Friday.

“If you're not intending us to disclose the names then trust us to appoint our own independent persons,” said the Chief Justice.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Friday submitted the remit to the bench headed by the CJI.

On Monday, Mehta had stressed that the remit of the committee should be very relevant because any unintentional message to the international investors and domestic investors that even a regulator or statutory monitoring authority also needs a monitoring by a committee appointed by the Supreme Court may have some adverse impact on the flow of money.

He had sought that the court could permit the government to suggest the remit of that committee with possible suggestions of names of the committee in a sealed cover, as it may not be appropriate to discuss in open court hearing.

The court was hearing two PILs, one of which sought a direction to the Centre to constitute a committee monitored by a retired apex court judge to inquire into the Hindenburg Research report, while the other one sought prosecution of short-seller Nathan Anderson of Hindenburg Research and his associates in India and the US for allegedly exploiting innocent investors and the ""artificial crashing"" of the Adani Group's stock value in the market.

Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after the Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate. The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as lies, saying it complies with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Wire,,,https://thewire.in/media/adani-group-wikipedia-articles,,None,"Paid Users, Including Employees, Improperly Edited Adani Articles, Says Wikipedia Newspaper","New Delhi: Wikipedia’s online newspaper, written and edited by community members, has published a report claiming that their investigations reveal that the Adani group employed undeclared paid editors to write and sanitise related Wikipedia pages.

While the Wikipedia report has been published in the aftermath of Hindenburg Research’s report on the Adani Group, it includes allegedly unscrupulous editing and contributions made years before this news break.

The Signpost, according to its own Wikipedia page, focuses on English Wikipedia, its sister projects, the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Wikimedia movement at large.

This article, written by a Wikipedia community user Smallbones, is tagged under the ‘disinformation report’ category.

The article notes that Adani and the eponymous group of companies were recently accused by a short-seller of a very serious “con”, involving accounting fraud, stock price manipulation and money laundering, referring to the Hindenburg report titled Adani Group: How The World’s 3rd Richest Man Is Pulling The Largest Con In Corporate History.

Citing that the company lost about $67 billion in net worth, the article asks, “Did he and his employees also try to “con” Wikipedia readers with non-neutral PR versions of related Wikipedia articles? Almost certainly they did.”

According to Signpost, more than 40 “sockpuppets” or undeclared paid editors created or revised nine related articles on the Adani family and family businesses.

‘Sockpuppetry’ refers to the misuse of multiple Wikipedia accounts.

All these accounts were later blocked or banned by Wikipedia.

Among those who fiddled with Adani articles, the report says, was a person using a company IP address, who rewrote the article for ‘Adani Group’ entirely.

The report says:

“Many of them edited several of the articles and added non-neutral material or puffery. A declared paid editor, using a company IP address, completely rewrote the Adani Group article. Others removed warnings about conflict-of-interest editing. Some created articles by unusual methods that avoided Wikipedia’s quality control systems.”

The report notes that perhaps “the most concerning finding” is that an user named ‘Hatchens’, who reviews articles was banned for abusing his position and was possibly corruptly approving several Adani articles. ‘Hatchens’ edited seven of the nine articles examined by the Signpost.

The report makes detailed illustrations of which user edited which article, revealing extensive changes made to articles earlier written in straightforward style by respected editors.

Pages that were thus tampered with include those on ‘Gautam Adani’, his wife ‘Priti Adani’, their son ‘Karan Adani’, Gautam’s nephew ‘Pranav Adani’, the ‘Adani Group’, ‘Adani Enterprises’, ‘Adani Transmission’, ‘Adani Green Energy’, and ‘Adani Ports and SEZ’.

The report also notes that as early as 2013 and 2014, Wikipedia’s account name regulations meant that two users named ‘Adanigrouponline’ and ‘Adani Group’ were blocked. “These were single purpose accounts (SPAs) editing Adani related articles, including a complete rewrite of the Adani Group article which removed a conflict-of-interest notice from the top of the article. They also added a detailed list of business units, and – the paid editors’ favorite section – a list of awards,” the report noted.

Signpost also notes that “no entirely on-Wiki investigation of a user’s edits can completely identify an editor’s name or employer. Even if the editor identifies themself as an employee of a company, they may be simply trying to embarrass the company…We can, however, examine the nearly complete record of edits made to Wikipedia and identify editors that are likely to be sockpuppets, or that appear to be working together with other accounts.”","Citing that the company lost about $67 billion in net worth, the article asks, “Did he and his employees also try to “con” Wikipedia readers with non-neutral PR versions of related Wikipedia articles?

Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken on Friday asked why the Narendra Modi government was “scared” of forming a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe into the Adani-Hindenburg row, stressing that the issue of handing over strategic sectors like airports and ports to a company, was linked to the country’s national security.

The BJP-ruled Centre’s “dealings” with the Adani Group smacks of “crony capitalism” and the creation of “government-sponsored private monopolies”, he said.

The Congress leader said that the Adani Group enjoyed 30% of the port capacity and 40% of the container capacity of the country.

“The Congress party wants to ask the Modi government why it is scared of forming a JPC on the issue. If the then Narasimha Rao government (Congress) could form a JPC for the Harshad Mehta scam, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee (BJP) for Ketan Parekh scam, then why aren’t you setting up a JPC (for Adani stock rout),” he asked.

The Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after US-based short-sheller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate led by Gautam Adani. The Adani Group had dismissed the charges as lies, saying it had complied with all laws and disclosure requirements.

Asked about Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s claim in a recent interview that there were scams of over ₹12 lakh crore during the Congress era, Mr. Maken said that the BJP government had failed to arrest or prove anyone guilty of corruption in these cases in the last nine years of its rule.

“If they could not do anything, they have no right to say anything. ..Congress is demanding a JPC, an investigation into the matter. At least grant us that opportunity for the investigation. You are denying us the probe,” he said.

He said the Congress would continue to press the government for a JPC probe into the issue as it was concerned about ""the open loot of public exchequer to fund crony capitalists”.

“People want to know how one group with doubtful credentials and alleged links with tax haven-operated offshore shell companies is monopolizing the assets of India, but all the government agencies are either missing from the action or facilitating that very process,"" the former Union Minister said.

Points to remember

Whenever privatisation of public assets takes place, he said, two things must be taken care of— one, there should be “one tender, open bid”, and second, there should be no monopoly.

“This government has set aside both these things to help the capitalists close to it,” Mr. Maken said.

“What worries me is that the company which has received ₹37,000 crore and ₹1,23,000 crore from entities located abroad has been handed over strategic sectors like airports and ports. Then this is the biggest threat for the country,” he said.

The Congress leader said the country wanted to know “who is the real owner of the black money being routed to India via offshore shell companies operating from tax havens”.

“What is strange is that this government is not even ready to investigate where this money is coming from, whether it is the money from China or Pakistan. We demand a JPC probe or Supreme Court-monitored investigation, but it (government) is not ready for even that. It is possible that the money invested belongs to China or Pakistan,” he said.

All the changes in the indices will be effective from March 31 this year, the exchange said in a late-night statement on Friday.

The Index Maintenance sub-committee of NSE Indices Ltd has decided to make replacement of stocks in various indices as part of its periodic review.

However, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) did not change its Nifty 50 index.

In the Nifty Next 50 index, apart from Adani Wilmar, other companies included are -- ABB India, Canara Bank, Page Industries and Varun Beverages.

On the other hand, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Gland Pharma, MphasiS and One 97 Communications would be dropped from the Nifty Next 50 index.

Earlier this week, index provider MSCI Inc postponed the implementation of reducing the weightages of two Adani group firms, Adani Total Gas and Adani Transmission, in its indices, citing the potential impact of price limit mechanisms.

The decision on the changes in the weightages, which was to be effective this month, has now been postponed to May.

The global index provider had cited potential replicability issues due to the impact of price limit mechanisms in two Adani group firms as the main reason behind the delay.

Adani Group stocks have taken a beating on the bourses after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations, including fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, against the business conglomerate led by Gautam Adani.

Debt exposure refers to the amount which a company risks losing as it has lent money that may not be paid back.

In response to a question in the Lok Sabha, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that LIC’s debt exposure to the Adani Group declined from Rs 6,347 crore in December to Rs 6,183 crore in March.

The ports-to-energy conglomerate led by billionaire Gautam Adani witnessed a stock market after on January 24, United States-based firm Hindenburg Research alleged that the group has amassed substantial debt by pledging overvalued shares.

Since then, listed firms of the Adani Group have lost a total of nearly $145 billion in market capitalisation. While the conglomerate has rejected the allegations, its responses failed to halt the stock market bloodbath.

LIC’s holdings in Adani Group companies have reportedly multiplied 10 times since September 2020. The state-run insurer accounts for over 98% of the entire insurance industry’s investment in the crisis-ridden conglomerate.

In February, reports had said that the value of investments made by LIC in the Adani Group had turned negative.

Explained: How LIC’s exposure to the embattled Adani Group has implications for middle class savings

Opposition parties have consistently criticised the Centre over LIC’s investments in the Adani Group and the implications it could have on the insurance schemes of citizens.

On Monday, the finance ministry also claimed that the rout in Adani Group shares did not have a significant impact at a systematic level.

“Nifty 50 declined by around 2.9% in the month of January 2023 and by around 4.9% in the two-month period of January and February 2023,” Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in a written reply to Congress leader TN Prathapan.

Chaudhary also informed that the Securities and Exchange Board of India is investigating the allegations pertaining to the Adani Group and has been directed by the Supreme Court to finish its probe within two months.","Debt exposure refers to the amount which a company risks losing as it has lent money that may not be paid back.

India recorded year-on-year growth of 4.4% in October-December quarter, down from 6.3% in the second quarter from July to September, data released by the government on Tuesday showed. The government, however, retained its growth forecast of 7% for 2022-’23 while revising the growth rate for 2021-’22 to 9.1% against the earlier estimate of 8.7%.

“Of course, the optimists will point to the upward revisions in past GDP [gross domestic product] numbers, but I am worried about the sequential slowdown,” Rajan said in an interview with PTI. “With the private sector unwilling to invest, the RBI still hiking rates, and global growth likely to slow later in the year, I am not sure where we find additional growth momentum.”

The renowned economist said that his concerns are not misplaced since the central bank has projected 4.2% growth for the fourth quarter of 2022-’23.

“At this point, the average annual growth of the October-December quarter relative to the similar pre-pandemic quarter three years ago is 3.7%,” he added. “This is dangerously close to our old Hindu rate of growth! We must do better.”

Indian economist Raj Krishna had coined the term “Hindu rate of growth” in 1978 to characterise the slow growth between the 1950s and the 1980s.

Adani Group crisis

On Sunday, Rajan, a finance professor at University of Chicago Booth, also questioned why the Securities and Exchange Board of India has not yet investigated four Mauritius-based funds that have reportedly parked 90% of their $6.9 billion in Adani Group stocks.

The funds – Elara India Opportunities Fund, Cresta Fund, Albula Investment Fund and APMS Investment Fund – have attracted attention for last couple of years after allegations that they may be shell companies.

In January, American firm Hindenburg Research in a report had alleged that overseas entities and shell companies were tied to Adani Group and surreptitiously owned stock in its listed firms. The listed firms of the Adani Group have together lost about $145 billion in market value since the report was published.

On Sunday, Rajan wondered if the market regulator needs help from investigating agencies to examine the allegations against the Adani Group.

“It does not serve the country well when certain families are seen as having privileged access to policymakers,” the former central bank governor added. “Let businesses flourish based on their acumen, not on their connections.”

Opposition leaders have repeatedly accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of favouring Gautam Adani, the chairperson of the ports-to-energy conglomerate. However, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has rejected the allegations, saying that the BJP has “nothing to hide or be afraid of”.","Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan on Sunday said he was worried that India’s economic growth has slowed further in the third quarter, PTI reported.

Weak global cues dented the sentiments at Dalal Street as the inflation worries spooked the traders. Selling pressure in select index heavyweights also dragged the indices lower.

Positive global cues pushed the indices higher during the early trade, but the expiry of weekly derivative series increased the volatility at Dalal Street. Analysts expect the street to remain range-bound in the near future.

For the day, BSE Sensex dropped 316.94 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 61,002.57. The Nifty50 declined 91.65 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 17,944.20. Broader markets tanked in tandem with the headline peers as BSE midcap and smallcap declined about per cent, each. India VIX jumped about 2 per cent to the 13.08 level.



Markets witnessed turbulence on the back of weak global cues as investors booked profit in banking, IT and telecom stocks. Rising inflation, US bond yields, and dollar index are once again creating a lot of uncertainty amongst investors, said Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice-President - Technical Research at Kotak Securities.



""For the bulls, 17,900-17,800 would act as a key support zone while 50-day SMA or 18,100 and 18,200 could be the immediate hurdle. On the flip side, the selling pressure could accelerate if the index slips below 17,800 and in case of further correction, it could slip to 17,700-17,650,"" he said.



All the sectors of Nifty settled in red for the day. Nifty Realty and PSU Bank indices plunged 2 per cent each. Nifty IT, Private Bank and Pharma indices over a per cent, each. Financial services, metal and media indices dropped about a per cent, each.

Among the Adani Group stocks, Adani Enterprises dropped more than 4 per cent as the Supreme Court refused to accept the Centre’s suggestion in a sealed cover. Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas hit lower circuits of 5 per cent, respectively. ACC also settled in the red.

Among the gainers, Adani Wilmar, NDTV and Adani Power hit upper circuits of 5 per cent, each. Adani Green Energy and Ambuja Cement rose 2 per cent. Adani Ports also managed to settle with gains.

Barring the Adani Group stocks, Nestle India declined more than 3 per cent after December quarter earnings. IndusInd Bank and SBI Life Insurance dropped 3 per cent each. HDFC Life, Mahindra & Mahindra, State Bank of India, Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies shed 2 per cent, each.

On the contrary, Larsen & Toubro jumped over 2 per cent, whereas Ultratech Cement, Bharat Petroleum and Hero MotoCorp gained 2 per cent, each. Asian Paints, Coal India and Grasim Industries added a per cent, each, during the day.

A lack of major triggers in the domestic market is attracting global cues to dictate the market trend. The US market is facing an unfavorable combination of higher-than-expected inflation and a stronger job market, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.



""The PPI (Producer Price Index) in the US came in at 6 per cent, in contrast to the expectation of 5.4 per cent. This suggests that interest rates have not yet peaked and will remain elevated for a long period,"" he said.

In his fresh attack on the Narendra Modi-led government at the centre, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi questioned why the Adani Group was given contracts despite the fact that they lacked prior experiences.

In the video, Rahul Gandhi goes on to allege that Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over six airports to the Adani group under Public Private Partnership in 2018.

Then a year later, the Indian government handed over Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, and Jaipur to the Adani Group. Gandhi also shared a poster of PM Modi with Gautam Adani.

“I spoke the truth in Parliament about the ties between PM Modi and Adani. With evidence, I spoke on how India's wealth is being looted. This truth was expunged from Parliament records"", Rahul Gandhi said, referring to his Lok Sabha speech on 8 February.

During his Lok Sabha speech, Rahul Gandhi had alleged that the Modi government changed certain laws in favour of Adani, who hails from the PM's home state of Gujarat.

“Why were six airports handed over to one company? Finance Ministry, NITI Aayog, AAI raised objections. By whom and why was it overruled? Concession lease was for 30 years, why was it increased to 50 years for Adani?"", Gandhi asked.

Meanwhile, posing a set of three questions to the government on the Adani issue as part of the party's 'Hum Adani Ke Hain Kaun (HAHK)' series, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said following the Hindenburg report, the world's biggest stock index provider MSCI announced that it would reduce the weightage of Adani Group stocks in its indices in the coming months.

The second largest provider, S&P Dow Jones, stated that it would remove Adani Enterprises from its sustainablity indices, while the third largest, FTSE Russell, announced it would make changes to the weightage of Adani Group companies in its indices effective March 20, he said.

""Should the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) not be trying to protect retail investors by at least ensuring that suspect companies' positions in key indices are reviewed?"" the Congress leader asked.

He also claimed that far from reviewing the inclusion of Adani Enterprises in the Nifty 50, the NSE announced on February 17 that four more Adani Group companies would be included in the NSE indices.

The Opposition has been demanding a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into allegations against Adani by US-based agency Hindenburg.

The 67 days long deadlock between the truck operators’ union and the Adani group-owned cement plants in Himachal Pradesh’s Barmana and Darlaghat over freight charges ended on Monday after the intervention of Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.

In a meeting held in Shimla, chaired by the Chief Minister, both sides agreed on the freight rates, and the company management assured to resume cement production from February 21.

The operations at cement plants situated at Barmana in Bilaspur district and Darlaghat in Solan district were closed by the company in December 2022, amid a dispute over freight charges between the truck operators and the company.

“Both the cement management companies and the truck operators have settled upon the new rates which will be ₹10.30 per kilometre per metric tonne for single-axle and ₹9.30 per kilometre per metric tonne for multi-axle. The factory management has given its consent to resume the cement production from tomorrow and truck operators have also agreed to transport at these rates,” said Mr. Sukhu.

“It’s due to the coordinated efforts of all, an acceptable solution to this matter has been possible. This dispute erupted soon after our government assumed power and the cement factory management announced to stop the production. Truck operators had gone on strike on December 16, 2022. Thereafter, the State government continued to hold talks with truck operators and factory management. After the change of ownership of the cement factories located at Darlaghat and Barmana, the management refused to provide freight at the old rates and from here the dispute escalated,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that both parties suffered a loss due to the stalemate, besides other stakeholders. “We arrived at a consensus, thereby protecting the interests of both the truck operators unions and the management as well, besides the welfare of all others who were being directly or indirectly hit by the stalemate,” said Mr. Sukhu.","In a meeting held in Shimla, chaired by the Chief Minister, both sides agreed on the freight rates, and the company management assured to resume cement production from February 21.
The factory management has given its consent to resume the cement production from tomorrow and truck operators have also agreed to transport at these rates,” said Mr. Sukhu.

The allegations come amid a continuing downward spiral in Adani stocks as the ports-to-power conglomerate struggles to reassure investors. On Thursday morning, five out of seven Adani Group stocks were trading in the red on the BSE Sensex. Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports, however, registered gains in early trading.

The article on the online newspaper, The Signpost, alleged that over 40 sockpuppets, or fake accounts, and undeclared paid editors created or revised nine articles on the Adani family and its businesses. These accounts were later either banned or blocked, the article said.

The Signpost claimed that many of these accounts edited several of the articles and added “non-neutral material or puffery”.

It added: “A declared paid editor, using a company IP address, completely rewrote the Adani Group article. Others removed warnings about conflict-of-interest editing. Some created articles by unusual methods that circumvented Wikipedia’s quality control systems.”

The newspaper also alleged that Hatchens, a user tasked with reviewing articles to be created on Wikipedia, was banned for “abusing his position” and “possibly corruptly approving several Adani articles”. It said that this was the most concerning finding of the article.

The newspaper noted that the conglomerate’s founder Gautam Adani lost $67 billion (over Rs 5.54 lakh crore) of his net worth since the allegations resurfaced. “Did he and his employees also try to ‘con’ Wikipedia readers with non-neutral PR versions of related Wikipedia articles?” it asked. “Almost certainly they did.”

Nate Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg Research, shared the findings of the report on Twitter on Tuesday. He said the article showed “how Adani systematically manipulated its Wikipedia entries using sock puppet accounts, undisclosed paid editors and removing evidence of conflicts of interest”.

Of all things—now the Signpost, Wikipedia's independent newspaper, is out w/ an article showing how Adani systematically manipulated its Wikipedia entries using sock puppet accounts, undisclosed paid editors & removing evidence of conflicts of interest.https://t.co/s7Yzw8rXys pic.twitter.com/UVG6dVWtfu — Nate Anderson (@ClarityToast) February 20, 2023

The Adani Group has been under the scanner since Hindenburg Research on January 24 accused it of pulling off the “largest con in corporate history”.

A report by the American firm claimed that the conglomerate has over several decades been involved in stock manipulation, accounting fraud, used offshore shells for money laundering and siphoned money from listed companies.

In a major fallout of the report, the Adani Group’s flagship company Adani Enterprises was also forced to call off its Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering that was meant to repay debt.

The conglomerate has denied the allegations, claiming that the report’s “principal objective” was to derail the share offer. It also stated that the firm “has not published this report for any altruistic reasons but purely out of selfish motives and in flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws”.

Nevertheless, Adani Group stocks have fallen sharply since the allegations surfaced. On Monday, the combined value of the conglomerate’s companies fell below the $100 billion mark (over Rs 8.27 lakh crore).","On Thursday morning, five out of seven Adani Group stocks were trading in the red on the BSE Sensex.

He hailed Balkrishna for reviving Patanjali from a sick company to a firm with a turnover of ₹40,000 crore this financial year due to his professional governance, transparent management and accountability. The dream of making India 'param vaibhavshali' can be achieved by creating empires like Patanjali, he said.

Earlier, Ramdev had claimed that cancer cases has increased in India after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, denying his claim, medical experts said there was no correlation between the two and the rise in cases was a normal phenomenon.

While speaking before a gathering at Miramar beach in Goa where his Patanjali Yog Samiti had organised a yoga camp, Ramdev said, “Cancer has increased a lot. The cases of this disease have gone up after the COVID-19 pandemic. People have lost their eyesight, their sense of hearing…."" Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant was also present with him on the stage.

Prior to that, on 4 February, Ramdev had sparked a controversy wherein he had accused Muslims of resorting to terror and abducting Hindu women while comparing Hinduism to Islam and Christianity. In a gathering in Barmer, Rajasthan, Baba Ramdev had alleged that the two faiths were obsessed with conversion while Hinduism taught its followers to do good.

The Wire,,'Was PM Modi Directly Involved in Adani's Bangladesh Power Deal?: TMC MP Asks EAM,https://thewire.in/government/adani-bangladesh-modi-jawhar-sircar-jaishankar,"Jaishankar, Narendra Modi, Gautam Adani and Jawhar Sircar. Photos: Official Twitter accounts of all four. Advertisement...",None,'Was PM Modi Directly Involved in Adani's Bangladesh Power Deal?: TMC MP Asks EAM,"New Delhi: Trinamool Congress MP Jawhar Sircar has written thrice to external affairs minister S. Jaishankar, requesting that he reveal if Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “himself steering” a power purchase agreement for coal-based supply between Bangladesh and the Adani group.

Sircar wrote the letters in the wake of reports that Bangladesh officials have “expressed unease” about the agreement. Since then, there have been recent allegations of stock manipulation and fraud against the Adani group.

Sircar has also commented in the letters on this “patently unfair PPA (power purchase agreement)” and its ability to trigger a “major anti-India groundswell” in Bangladesh.

Talking to The Wire, Sircar said there has been no response to any of them and that he only decided to make these public after giving the minister “a fair chance”.

MP first wrote in December following WaPo report

In his first letter on the subject, sent on December 13, 2022, Sircar had, while mentioning a report in The Washington Post, headlined ‘How political will often favors a coal billionaire and his dirty fossil fuel,’ pointed out that it spoke of the “special efforts put in by the Prime Minister himself during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015 for a $4.5 billion deal that was signed for India to sell electricity to Bangladesh”.

The Rajya Sabha MP had added that “the report mentions of a $1.7 billion, 1600 MW coal powered plant of the Adani group in Godda district of Jharkhand and how the Washington Post has accessed and analysed the 163-page Power Purchase Agreement”.

He had further brought to the notice of the EAM that the report said that the PPA “mandates that Bangladesh must pay Adani approximately $450 mn a year in capacity and maintenance charges – regardless of whether it generates any electricity. It further mentions that Bangladesh has 40% more power generation than the peak demand and that it would have to buy Adani’s electricity at more than five times the market price of bulk electricity in the country.”

‘Statements providing handle to strong anti-India elements’

The TMC MP had further raised concerns about how “these statements provide a handle to the strong anti-India elements in our neighbouring country” and pointed out that “our [India’s] relationship with Bangladesh is extremely sensitive and such adverse reports circulated in the run-up to elections are the stuff of agitations.”

He had also urged the EAM for a response. On not getting one, Sircar wrote another letter to Jaishankar on January 31, 2023. This was soon after allegations against the Adani group were levelled in the Hindenburg Research report.

As there was still no reply, Sircar in his February 13 letter to the EAM pointed out that “no reply has come. He also wrote that “Adani-related matter are now in the eye of the public storm, and this aspect of his patently unfair PPA with Bangladesh may be triggering a major anti-India groundswell”.

‘Items, documents indicate PM steered deal’

The MP said “there are items and documents to indicate that PM was himself steering this deal/project from his first post-election visit to Dhaka.”

He added that at a later stage, the EAM was “actively involved in pushing this Adani deal through”.

Urging the minister to comment on the matter, Sircar said “we need to know the official version on whether this patently-unfair deal, leading to disaffection in Bangladesh, was actively supported by India or not” and if “MEA did not intervene in Adani’s profiteering at the cost of or relations with Bangladesh”.

MEA distanced itself from deal after Bangladesh sought revision

After the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) earlier this month demanded a revision of the 2017 agreement to buy electricity from the 1600 MW plant of the Adani Power Limited located at Godda, the Union government had distanced itself from the deal.

On being asked about the matter, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had told journalists: “I understand you are referring to a deal between a sovereign government and an Indian company.” On being pressed to state the government’s position in the matter, he had added: “I do not think we are involved in this”.","Sircar wrote the letters in the wake of reports that Bangladesh officials have “expressed unease” about the agreement.

On January 24, a report by United-States based firm Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of manipulating stocks and improperly using tax havens. The Hindenburg report plunged the group led by billionaire Gautam Adani into crisis, wiping about $120 billion in market value.

Ramesh on Wednesday urged the central bank to ensure that the Adani Group’s “excessive debt exposure” does not destabilise the country’s banking system. He also alleged in a tweet that the conglomerate has the blessings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Congress general secretary in charge of communications urged the Reserve Bank of India to look into two matters: “One, what is the true Adani exposure of the Indian banking system? Two, what are the explicit and implicit guarantees that the Adani Group has been given that it will be bailed out by Indian banks if foreign funding dries up?”

Ramesh said that public sector financial institutions such as the Life Insurance Corporation of India and the State Bank of India have been “unusually generous” towards the Adani Group in recent years. “The RBI must ensure that risks to financial stability are investigated and contained,” he said.

In the letter to the SEBI chief, the Congress MP said that the markets watchdog must investigate all potential violations by the Adani Group and ensure transparancy about who is investing in the conglomerate.

Ramesh said that such an investigation must be seen as fair and complete, with no favours shown to the group. “Any failure to do so will cast a shadow on Indian corporate governance and on India’s financial regulators, and could affect our ability to raise funds globally,” he wrote.

The Congress leader said that the Adani Group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises was included on the National Stock Exchange’s Nifty 50 index in September “despite the firm’s weak fundamentals, an excessive price-to-earnings ratio and a tiny free float”. A free float refers to the proportion of shares that can be bought publicly in the securities markets by international investors.

“In recent days, global stock indices have suspended Adani Group companies while the matter is investigated, but the NSE has failed to take any similar action to protect investors,” Ramesh noted. “Is it not SEBI’s responsibility to ensure that index investors are protected from investing in questionable firms?”

The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that it will hear a petition by a Congress leader seeking an investigation into the Adani Group on February 17, PTI reported.

The public interest litigation, filed by Congress leader Jaya Thakur, has sought an investigation under the supervision of a sitting Supreme Court judge. She has also sought a direction to investigate the role of the Life Insurance Corporation of India and State Bank of India in investing large amounts of money in the now-embattled conglomerate.

However, Mehta said that the Centre would provide the names of members of the panel. He also told the court that Securities and Exchange Board of India is capable of handling the fallout in the markets caused due to the report by United States-based investment firm Hindenburg Research that had levelled the allegations against the Adani Group.

The Supreme Court agreed to the Centre’s suggestion and said it would pass an order on the matter after the government makes its submission on the committee. On SEBI, the court added that it did not want to undermine the competency of the markets regulator.

The statement came three days after the court had expressed concern about the rout in shares of the Adani Group, saying that investors have suffered losses running into several lakh crores. On Friday, the Supreme Court had sought views of the Centre and SEBI on how a more robust mechanism can be installed to protect investors and also proposed forming a committee.

The ports-to-energy conglomerate led by billionaire Gautam Adani has been steeped in a crisis since January 24, when Hindenburg Research alleged that the group has amassed substantial debt by pledging overvalued shares. Since the report was released, Adani Group companies have lost nearly Rs 9 lakh crore in the stock market bloodbath.

In a brutal fallout, Adani Group flagship company Adani Enterprises was also forced to call off its Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering that was meant to repay debt. The Adani Group has alleged that the report’s “principal objective” was to derail the share offer.

The court was hearing two petitions filed by Advocate Manohar Lal Sharma and Vishal Tiwari

In his plea, Sharma had sought directions to SEBI and the home ministry to conduct an investigation and register a first information report against Hindenburg Research founder Nathan Anderson and his associates in India.

He has accused Anderson and his associates of hatching a criminal conspiracy by short-selling Adani stocks before releasing their report. Investment research firms like Hindenburg often engage in “activist short selling”, or publicising information about companies to trigger a fall in their share prices.

On the other hand, Tiwari has sought the formation of a committee under a retired Supreme Court judge to investigate the Hindenburg Research report.","The Supreme Court agreed to the Centre’s suggestion and said it would pass an order on the matter after the government makes its submission on the committee.
Since the report was released, Adani Group companies have lost nearly Rs 9 lakh crore in the stock market bloodbath.
In a brutal fallout, Adani Group flagship company Adani Enterprises was also forced to call off its Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering that was meant to repay debt.
The Adani Group has alleged that the report’s “principal objective” was to derail the share offer.

Seated next to me on the train was a young man looking up stock prices on his phone. He worked in the finance department of a private healthcare company.

“If you look around my office during working hours, you’ll find everyone glued to their phones, trading stocks,” he said. “Even the peons.”

India had indeed seen a surge in retail investors during the pandemic years. Had it not been for a buoyant stock market, the young man said, people like him would have struggled. Since demonetisation, salaries have stagnated, inflation has skyrocketed. “No one is doing well,” he said. “Except Adani.”

He smiled, as if he had shared an inside joke.

He was a supporter of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. He had voted for the party in both the national and state elections and said he would continue to do so. “Comfort milta hain,” he said, his eyes narrowing behind his glasses. They give me comfort.

The “comfort” had nothing to do with Hindutva, he added quickly, as if reading my mind. “Bahut Hindu Muslim karaa rahe hai” – the BJP is instigating trouble between Hindus and Muslims, he said, disapprovingly.

But Narendra Modi was working hard to attract investment into the country, he claimed, which would eventually raise all boats – not just that of Gautam Adani, founder and chairman of the Adani Group, best known as Modi’s closest business ally.

“Modi pe bharosa hai,” the young man said. I trust Modi.

‘The protective shield’

Trust was the keyword in Modi’s defence in Parliament last week.

The Opposition had sought to corner the government after the Hindenburg report, which accused the Adani Group of “brazen stock manipulation and fraud”, triggered a meltdown that had made headlines across the world.

In Parliament, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reeled off a list of alleged favours the Modi government had advanced to the conglomerate – from getting public sector banks to give the group millions of rupees in risky loans, to making state-owned Life Insurance Corporation invest in its firms, to bending rules to award six airports to Adani, unleashing investigative agencies to bulldoze rival businessmen into selling assets, and arm-twisting governments in neighbouring Sri lanka and Bangladesh into signing deals with Adani.

In 2014, when Modi became prime minister, Adani was ranked 609 on the list of the richest people in the world, Gandhi said. “Then magic happened and he reached the second rank,” he said. Fellow MPs thumped their desks and quipped, “Modi hai to mumkin hai” – Modi makes the impossible possible.

When PM Modi was Gujarat CM, one man stood shoulder-to-shoulder with PM Modi.



Adani was LOYAL to the PM.



The result of that was tremendous expansion of his business in Gujarat.



The real magic began when PM Modi reached Delhi in 2014.

The next day, it was the prime minister’s turn to thunder back. In the Lok Sabha, Modi boasted that he had the “trust of 140 crore Indians”. “You can’t penetrate this protective shield with your lies,” he said.

He did not once name Adani – nor did he respond to the Opposition’s allegations. Instead, amid a din in the Rajya Sabha of “Adani-Modi bhai bhai” – Adani and Modi are brothers – he raised his hands and roared: “The country is seeing that one man is enough to take on a brigade.”

Is that actually the case?

A conspiracy of silence

It isn’t as if the Adani crisis hasn’t already claimed a political scalp. It has – in the United Kingdom. The brother of former prime minister Boris Johnson stepped down as director of Elara Capital, one of the firms that allegedly served as “stock parking entities” for the Adani Group, helping it evade regulatory scrutiny, according to Hindenburg. The Adani Group has denied this claim.

In most democracies, crony capitalism is a serious charge.

But in India, it is unclear whether it can dent Modi’s image.

For one, the Opposition’s chances of taking the message to voters is hobbled by the reluctance of the mainstream news media to broadcast it. As Alt News reported, India’s major TV channels and Hindi newspapers blanked out the Hindenburg report for two whole days.

A day after Gandhi’s speech in the Lok Sabha, I bought copies of the top Hindi newspapers in Delhi. Amar Ujala hadn’t even considered the day’s biggest political story worthy of front page space.

It isn’t just the media. India’s independent regulators have chosen to maintain a stony silence even as global indices, rating firms and investors have reviewed – and downgraded – Adani firms.

‘So what?’

Yet, a stock rout is impossible to hide. At least from India’s largely upper-caste urban middle class, which, despite its small size, has a disproportionate sway on the country’s politics.

“It’s all over my social media timeline, this Modi-Adani talk,” said Achla, an IT professional I met on the Delhi metro while she was heading for a job interview. “But tell me, who takes Rahul Gandhi seriously?”

Most others I accosted at Rajiv Chowk, Delhi’s busiest metro station – named after Rahul Gandhi’s father – also shrugged off the allegations. “So what if they are true?” asked Mohit, a civil services aspirant from Bihar. “Such cooperation [between the government and business groups] happens all over the world.”

Adani had built his fortunes by working hard, argued Tapasya Acharya, 32. “He started out by cycling and selling clothes,” she claimed, incorrectly. As for Modiji, “he can only act in desh hit – the country’s interest.”

One young man, however, was scathing in his criticism. “Everyone knows this is a scam,” he said. “Any other businessman would have been raided by CBI, ED, by now,” he said, referring to India’s federal agencies, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate. But nothing will happen in this case “kyunki ghar ka aadmi hain”, he alleged – Adani is like a member of Modi’s family.

A chartered accountant by profession, the young man did not want to be identified by name. “Maybe it is better not to even say I’m a CA,” he said, as he walked off. “Who knows, this government can come after anybody.”

‘A change in psychology’

What’s helping the government tide over the crisis is that so far at least, it hasn’t caused much direct pain to ordinary Indians.

I called up LIC agents in four cities – Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi. They claimed they hadn’t been deluged with phone calls from clients fretting about the possibility of their hard-earned money going up in smoke.

Only one agent, Vikas Rana, who lives in Ghaziabad, abutting Delhi, said of the 350-400 clients he has, two or three had called. He said he assured them they had nothing to worry: LIC’s investments in Adani amounted to “talab mein balti” – a bucket in a lake.

In a statement issued after the stock rout, the insurance behemoth said its exposure to Adani firms amounted to just about 1% of its assets under management. But as the Indian Express had reported last year, the key distinction was that private insurers and mutual funds, which usually shadow LIC’s investments into companies, had stayed away from investing in Adani. A financial advisor in Ahmedabad described this as the “the saving grace”. “The middle class is invested in mutual funds, which are untouched by this collapse,” he explained on the phone.

Even Rana, the Ghaziabad agent who helps people invest in a range of financial products (LIC policies for the “lower rung”, stocks and mutual funds for “people like you and me”), said he had made sure none of his clients had invested in “overvalued” Adani stocks.

Yet, he didn’t think the LIC investments were questionable. At best, it was a case of “halka phulka foul”, he said – low-key wrong-doing.

He continued, with a laugh: “Hindutva has changed the country’s psychology. Hum Modi ji ki baat maanna chahte hain” – We want to trust Modi.

But it isn’t just Hindutva that makes people look the other way, claimed the financial advisor in Ahmedabad, who did not want to be identified. People are tolerant of crony capitalism, he said, because they believe that’s the only way for India to grow: “Agar wo log paisa nahi banayenge, to hum kaise bana payenge.” If they don’t make money, how will we?

Rana, the Ghaziabad agent, claimed that many people believed the Congress had instigated the Hindenburg report. “Just when the country is doing well, wo log tang adda rahe hai – they are attempting to derail it.”

The only cause of worry for the government, the financial advisor in Ahmedabad said, would be if the Adani fall caused a larger contagion in the stock market. “In 2008, there was panic selling,” he said. “People even exited good stocks. But this time, the market has shown maturity.”

Does it really matter if one company went down, he asked.

The fate of Adani’s projects

It is a question that those who live in the shadow of Adani Group’s upcoming projects are asking.

In Mumbai, the sprawling slum of Dharavi is being handed over to Adani Realty for “redevelopment” – a process that involves replacing low-income, low-slung housing with highrise buildings to free up valuable real estate for sale. The Adani firm won the tender in December 2022, months after the BJP returned to power in a coalition government in Maharashtra.

Shakir Husain, 25, who lives in a 6 by 10 feet room with his parents, said he has been hearing about Dharavi’s redevelopment since childhood. “We don’t care who redevelops it. We just want redevelopment,” he said. He was hopeful the Hindenburg report wouldn’t affect Adani’s plans. “Adani still has a lot of money,” he said.

But Ghanshyam Bhapkar, from Jhopadpatti Chalval association, said the Adani stock collapse was a wake-up call for the government, which must take back the project from the company, else “slum dwellers will suffer”. “The company is sinking,” he said. “It has committed fraud. Is the government sleeping?”

In sand-swept Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, villagers who fought a long legal battle against Adani’s acquisition of land for a solar park, said they were happy to hear about the company’s misfortunes. “Der hai, andher nahi” – justice comes, even if it is delayed, said Bhairon Singh, the former sarpanch of Nedan village.

While the land acquisition had started under a BJP government, when the High Court struck it down in 2021, Congress was in charge. “We were hopeful the High Court verdict would be swiftly implemented, and people would get back their land,” Singh said. “But that hasn’t happened.”

When it came to Adani, he said, “the BJP and the Congress are the same”.

Adani in Opposition states

The Opposition’s efforts to corner Modi on Adani will be tested by the conglomerate’s presence in the states it rules.

While speaking in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi held up a photo of Modi travelling with Adani in a plane. The BJP was quick to respond by circulating photos of Adani with Ashok Gehlot, Congress veteran and chief minister of Rajasthan.

The next day, I met a political consultant who has worked closely with the Congress. “The time has come for the Opposition to decide who it should not be taking money from,” he said.

Business groups fund political parties in India. The funding details remain shrouded in secrecy thanks to the opacity allowed under the electoral bond programme.

The consultant claimed cash-strapped Congress had turned a blind eye to Adani money flooding Congress units in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, states where his companies have coal, thermal and renewable energy projects.

“You need money for the benefit of the party,” the consultant said. “If the money is eating up the chances of your party then you must end the deal.”

He added it wasn’t just money, though. He claimed Opposition state governments mistakenly believed that by helping Adani, they could help stave off action by the Enforcement Directorate against their leaders.

“They have to be ready to go to jail,” he said. “But they must seize the moment by cancelling Adani projects.”

So far, the only state to have cancelled an Adani contract after the stock collapse has been BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.

Tabassum Barnagarwala contributed reporting from Mumbai.","In 2014, when Modi became prime minister, Adani was ranked 609 on the list of the richest people in the world, Gandhi said.

The ratings outlook has been changed to negative for Adani Green Energy Ltd, Adani Green Energy Restricted Group (AGEL RG-1), Adani Transmission Step-One Limited and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited.

Moody’s, however, retained a stable outlook for Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited, Adani International Container Terminal Private Limited, Adani Green Energy Restricted Group (AGEL RG-2) and Adani Transmission Restricted Group 1.

“These rating actions follow the significant and rapid decline in the market equity values of the Adani Group companies following the recent release of a report from a short-seller highlighting governance concerns in the Group,” Moody’s said.

The ports-to-energy conglomerate led by billionaire Gautam Adani has been steeped in a crisis since January 24, when investment firm Hindenburg Research alleged that the group has amassed substantial debt by pledging overvalued shares. Since the report was released, Adani Group companies have lost nearly Rs 9 lakh crore in the stock market bloodbath.

In the wake of the allegations, Adani Group flagship company Adani Enterprises was also forced to call off its Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering that was meant to repay debt.

On Thursday, global stock index compiler Morgan Stanley Capital International cut the free float status of Adani Enterprises, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and ACC Limited. A free float is the proportion of shares that can be bought publicly in the securities markets by international investors.

The Adani Group, on the other hand, claimed that Hindenburg published the report “purely out of selfish motives and in flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws”.

In a brutal fallout, Adani Group flagship company Adani Enterprises was also forced to call off its Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering that was meant to repay debt. The Adani Group has alleged that the report’s “principal objective” was to derail the share offer.

On Friday, the Supreme Court sought views of the Centre and the Stock Exchange Board of India, or SEBI, on how a more robust mechanism can be installed to protect investors, according to Live Law.

The bench, also comprising Justices PS Narasimha and JB Pardiwala, then directed SEBI to file a response by February 13.

The court was hearing two petitions filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma and Vishal Tiwari, respectively.

In his plea, Sharma had sought directions to SEBI and the home ministry to conduct an investigation and register a first information report against Hindenburg Research founder Nathan Anderson and his associates in India.

On the other hand, Tiwari sought the formation of a committee under a retired Supreme Court judge to investigate the Hindenburg Research report.

Formation of a committee

During Friday’s hearing, the chief justice also proposed forming an expert committee for seeking recommendation on strengthening the regulatory framework, reported Live Law.

“We do not want to cast any doubt on the SEBI or the regulatory agencies,” Chandrachud said. “But the suggestion is to have a broader thought process so that some inputs can be obtained. And then the Government can take a call…”

Bench - We can give those powers to SEBI too so that it has better provisions to ensure protection in the future. And also now the stock market is not a place where only large investors invest. Now, investment is made by a wide spectrum of middle class. — Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 10, 2023

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing on behalf of SEBI, argued that the rout in shares of the Adani Group was triggered by the Hindenburg report, which is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the court.

“SEBI has been looking into [the Adani crisis] from whatever statutory regime is existing,” Mehta said, according to Live Law.

The chief justice then suggested that SEBI should have a consultation with the finance minister and come up with a framework.

“These are just loud thinking,” Chief Justice Chandrachud said. “We are conscious that whatever we say may also affect the stock market.

“Since year-end, we have further reduced in Adani companies. We have no exposure left,” Christopher Wright, the fund’s head of ESG (environmental, social and governance) risk monitoring, said.

At the end of 2022, the wealth fund had stakes in Adani Total Gas, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone and Adani Green Energy.

The group led by billionaire Gautam Adani has been engulfed in crisis since United States-based investment firm Hindenburg Research alleged in a report on January 24 that the conglomerate had engaged in decades of stock manipulation and accounting fraud. It also accused the group of improper use of offshore tax havens and raised concerns about high debt of seven listed Adani companies.

Since the report was published, Adani Group’s combined market capitalisation has collapsed by over $100 billion.

The partnership with Adani Group’s hydrogen venture was announced in June and TotalEnergies was slated to take a 25% stake in the project, according to The Economic Times. TotalEnergies is one of the biggest foreign investors in the Adani Group.

On Wednesday, TotalEnergies Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said that the company was waiting for the results of an audit announced by Adani Group in response to the allegations made by Hindenburg Research.

“The deal was announced but nothing was signed,” Pouyanne said, according to Business Today. “Mr [Gautam] Adani has other things to deal with now, it’s just good sense to pause things while the audit goes forward.”

In a report published last month, Hindenburg Research had alleged that Adani Group engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud to pull off the “largest con in corporate history”. It claimed that the conglomerate headed by Gautam Adani has amassed substantial debt by pledging overvalued shares.

On its part, the Adani Group has called it “a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations”. The conglomerate has also said that the report was a “calculated attack” on India and its institutions.

On Wednesday, Pouyanne said that TotalEnergies has a $3.1 billion (over Rs 25,603 crore) investment in Adani Green and Adani Total Gas. He said the firm was happy both of the companies were performing well.

“These companies have assets and revenue and are healthy,” he said, according to PTI.

Adani vs Hindenburg

In its report, Hindenburg Research had said that it holds short positions in the Adani Group companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments. Short positions are “created when a trader sells a security first with the intention of repurchasing it or covering it later at a lower price”, according to Investopedia.

Investment research firms like Hindenburg often engage in “activist short selling”, or publicising information about companies to trigger a fall in their share prices.

On January 29, the Adani Group issued a 413-page response. The conglomerate alleged that the mala fide intention of Hindenburg was apparent as the report was released ahead of a $2.5 billion (over Rs 20,646 crore) share sale by its flagship firm Adani Enterprises.

“It is tremendously concerning that the statements of an entity sitting thousands of miles away, with no credibility or ethics has caused serious and unprecedented adverse impact on our investors,” the Adani Group said.

Modi, in his reply to the motion of thanks on the president’s address in the Lok Sabha, alleged that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government “turned every opportunity into a problem” between 2004 and 2014. He made the speech a day after Gandhi accused the Centre of helping the Adani Group, now in the midst of a crisis, by tweaking rules and regulations in its favour.

The Wayanad MP, while interacting with journalists on Wednesday, claimed that the prime minister is “shell-shocked” and did not answer any of the questions that he had posed about the Bharatiya Janata Party government’s role in the meteoric rise of Adani.

“I had not asked any complicated questions,” Gandhi said. “I had only asked how many times he [Adani] had travelled with you, how many times you had met him there. Those were simple questions but there were no answers.”

During the debate on the motion of thanks to the president’s address in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Gandhi had asked how many times Adani had bagged a contract in a foreign country after the prime minister’s visit.

Citing examples of the Adani Group signing business deals with countries such as Israel, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the Congress leader alleged that “India’s foreign policy is Adani foreign policy”.

On Wednesday, Gandhi said he is not satisfied with Modi’s response. “If Adani is not his friend, he [Modi] should have said that an investigation will be carried out,” he said. “Shell companies have been made, benami funds are being circulated, but the prime minister did not say anything about it. It is clear that the prime minister is shielding him [Adani].”

No personal issues with Adani, Ambani: Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury

In the Lok Sabha, Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdury said that Gandhi touched the right chord by flagging the crisis, but added that the party has no “personal issues” with either Adani or Reliance Industries Chairperson Mukesh Ambani.

“We want the country to grow and have more industrialists,” Chowdhury, the Congress’ leader in the Lok Sabha said, according to PTI. “I am saying it openly, we have no personal issues with Adani ji. We have no personal issues with Ambani ji.”

‘Some people unhappy with India’s achievements’: Modi

Modi remarked in the Lok Sabha that some people who are “steeped in pessimism” are not happy with India’s achievements.

“This pessimism is because between 2004-14, economy was shattered, inflation was in double digits, unemployment was at its peak,” the prime minister said. “...So when something good happens, they feel disheartened.”

Modi claimed that turning opportunities into problems became the UPA regime’s identity from 2004 to 2014. “When the information age was on the rise, they got embroiled in the 2G scam,” he said. “When the nuclear deal happened, they got stuck in the cash-for-votes scam. When the Commonwealth Games of 2010 were organised, a scam took place and caused shame for the country in the world.”

The ports-to-power conglomerate plunged into a crisis on January 24, when United States-based short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that it amassed substantial debt by pledging overvalued shares. In the following days, shares of Adani Group companies fell sharply on account of the allegations.

The Opposition has been claiming that ordinary citizens were losing money on account of investments made by the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation and State Bank of India in the conglomerate led by billionaire Gautam Adani.

Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday that the exposure of Indian banks to the Adani Group is insufficient in itself to present a substantial risk to their standalone credit profiles. It added that bank ratings “remain driven by expectations that the banks would receive extraordinary sovereign support, if needed”.

Fitch, however, noted that the Adani Group plays an important role in India’s infrastructure sector. “Infrastructure development may slow, curbing India’s sustainable economic growth rate, if its ability to contribute to the government’s infrastructure rollout plans is impaired, though we believe the impact on growth would be likely to be small,” the ratings agency said.

Moody’s said that although public sector banks have greater levels of exposure to the Adani Group than private banks, the extent of the exposure is less than 1% of total loans for most banks, PTI reported.

“Risks for banks can increase if Adani becomes more reliant on bank loans,” it said. Moody’s, however, said that the overall quality of Indian banks’ corporate loans will remain stable.

Allegations against the Adani Group

In its January 24 report, Hindenburg Research claimed that the conglomerate has over the decades been involved in stock manipulation, accounting fraud, used offshore shells for money laundering and siphoned money from listed companies.

The Adani Group described the Hindenburg Research report as a “calculated attack” on India and its institutions.

“It is tremendously concerning that the statements of an entity sitting thousands of miles away, with no credibility or ethics has caused serious and unprecedented adverse impact on our investors,” the Adani Group said.","The exposure of banks to the embattled Adani Group is not large enough to damage their credit quality, global ratings agency Fitch and Moody’s said on Tuesday.

An FPO is a process where a company raises funds by selling its shares to the public again.

The finance minister added that there has been an accretion of $8 billion (approximately Rs 65,786 crore)to the forex reserves in the last two days alone.

The Adani Group had withdrawn the Rs 20,000-crore FPO after a report by United States-based firm Hindenburg Research on January 24 accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation and improper use of offshore tax havens.

The conglomerate had said it was taking the decision considering market volatility and added it would return the money to the investors.

In the past few days, the Opposition has been claiming that ordinary citizens were losing money on account of investments made by the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation and State Bank of India in the conglomerate led by billionaire Gautam Adani.

On Saturday, Sitharaman said there are fluctuations in every market but the accretion over the last few days establishes the fact that the perception of both India and its inherent strengths is intact.

On the allegations against Adani Group, the minister said the country’s independent financial sector regulators will be looking into them,

“For keeping the market and the markets regulated in prime condition, the Sebi [Securities and Exchange Board of India] is the authority,” she added. “And it has the wherewithal to keep that prime condition.”

On Friday too, Sitharaman, along with the Reserve Bank of India, had sought to allay concerns about overexposure of banks and insurers to the crisis-ridden Adani Group. A day later, the Securities and Exchange Board of India also said that the stock market has demonstrated stability and is continuing to function in a “transparent, fair and efficient manner”.

Sitharaman on Friday said that both the LIC and SBI have issued detailed statements on the matter, CNN-News18 reported. “And I know the chairperson or the CMD has himself come out and explained how they are not overexposed or whatever they said and also said look, we are sitting over profits for the exposure that we have, which is well within the limit,” she said.

Sitharaman said that words coming “out of the horse’s mouth” have greater credibility. “They have very clearly said that their exposure is very well within the permitted limits and that they are even now with the valuation falling as well, they are still sitting over profit,” she said.

The finance minister also asserted that India remains a well-regulated financial market, and said that investors will continue to have confidence in it.

“Our regulators are normally very, very stringent about certain governance practices,” she told CNN-News18 in an interview. “So one instance, however much talked about globally it may be, I would think, it is not going to be indicative of how well Indian financial markets are governed.”

Measures taken to address excessive volatility: SEBI

In a statement, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, or SEBI, said that it has put in place a set of surveillance measures to address excessive volatility in specific stocks, referring to the shares of the Adani Group.

“This mechanism gets automatically triggered under certain conditions of price volatility in any stock.” it said.

SEBI also said it was committed to ensuring market integrity and ensuring that the markets continue to have the appropriate structural strength to function in an uninterrupted, transparent and efficient manner.

Banking sector resilient and stable: RBI

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India said that it maintains a constant vigil on the banking sector and on individual banks with a view to maintaining financial stability.

“As per the RBI’s current assessment, the banking sector remains resilient and stable,” a press release said on Friday. “Various parameters relating to capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, provision coverage and profitability are healthy. Banks are also in compliance with the Large Exposure Framework [LEF] guidelines issued by the RBI.”

The State Bank of India’s Chairman Dinesh Khara also said that its overall exposure to the Adani Group is at 0.88% of its loan book, or about Rs 27,000 crore, PTI reported.

Khara said that the bank does not foresee the conglomerate facing any challenge in servicing its debt obligations. He said that the group has an excellent repayment record.

The SBI chairman also said that the bank has not given loans against shares to the Adani Group and also that there has been no refinance request from the ports-to-mining group, according to PTI.

Crisis in the Adani Group

On January 24, Hindenburg Research, a company that specialises in short-selling or betting against a firm’s share price in the expectation that it will fall, alleged in a report that the Adani Group had engaged in decades of stock manipulation and accounting fraud. It also accused the conglomerate of improper use of offshore tax havens and raised concerns about high debt of seven listed Adani companies.

Since the report was published, Adani Group’s combined market capitalisation has collapsed by over $100 billion.

On Wednesday, Adani was forced to abruptly call off its Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering – intended to raise money to repay debt – even after it was fully subscribed. The collapse started last week after an American firm called Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of manipulating stocks and improperly using tax havens.

The crash in Adani’s stock value, the consequent struggles to raise money and the possibility of a default, experts say, could potentially hurt the Indian economy and damage the reputation of its institutions.

Here’s how the crisis unfolded, how it might affect the Adani Group and the Indian economy at large.

Crisis calendar

January 24 Hindenburg Research publishes a report alleging that the Adani Group is pulling off the “largest con in corporate history”. It claims the Indian conglomerate has been involved in stock manipulation, accounting fraud, improper use of tax havens and money laundering.

January 26 The Adani Group dismisses Hindenburg’s allegations as “maliciously mischievous” and threatens legal action. Hindenburg dares it to file a lawsuit.

January 27 The follow-on public offering of Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship, opens to a muted response and is subscribed just 0.01 times that first day. By now, the Adani Group has lost $48 billion in value.

January 29 In a 413-page response to Hindenburg, the Adani Group calls the allegations a “calculated attack” on India. Its invocation of nationalism receives support from people aligned with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which in turn is perceived to have close ties with the conglomerate. Hindenburg quickly issues, saying the conglomerate hasn’t answered its allegations.

January 30 The Adani Group’s market losses balloon to around $65 billion despite its attempts to assuage investors.

January 31 The follow-on public offer of Adani Enterprises closes, oversubscribed 1.12 times.

February 1 The group withdraws its follow-on public offer saying it wants to protect investor interest amid the “unprecedented situation and the current market volatility”. The investors will get their money back, it says. Media reports claim that companies linked to Adani picked up shares in the follow-on public offer. The stock crash wipes out a substantial chunk of Gautam Adani’s personal wealth and sees him lose his position as Asia’s richest man. In Australia, where the Adani Group is involved in the controversial Carmichael mining project, the market regulator says that it will review the Hindenburg report.

February 2 As the Adani empire’s market losses exceed $100 billion, the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, launches an investigation into the stock crash and Hindenburg’s allegations. The Reserve Bank of India reportedly tells banks to provide details of their exposure to the conglomerate. In Parliament, the Opposition demands an investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee or a panel constituted by the Supreme Court.

There’s Evidence That The Adani Group Likely Bought Into Its Own $2.5 Billion Share Sale https://t.co/m1FBHEldFf pic.twitter.com/QRSF75Vyrk — Forbes (@Forbes) February 1, 2023

Ratings downgrade

The valuations of Adani’s companies have rocketed over the past three years. Between April 2020 and August 2022, the value of its stocks rose nearly 4000%. Now that the stocks are plummeting, these companies are facing a downgrade in ratings.

Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee points out that some of the group’s securities that Credit Suisse had assigned a lending value of 75% are now rated zero. This makes it difficult for the conglomerate to raise money. Its lenders are either asking for more collateral or are scrutinising the value of the companies’ debt to lend against. The American investment bank Citigroup has already stopped giving loans to the group against securities.

The botched share sale of Adani Enterprises has only added to this heightened scrutiny. There are reports that at least two companies allegedly linked to the Adani Group underwrote and likely bought in the share sale. An underwriter pledges to buy the unsold shares in a share sale. These two companies were accused by Hindenburg of helping the Adani Group engage in corporate malfeasance. The conglomerate denied the links.

The oversubscription of the Adani share sale was assisted by rich Indian individuals at the last minute, after retail investors stayed away, reported Bloomberg, the Financial Times and The Economic Times. Retail investors are individuals or non-professional investors.

Potential spillover

It is not only Hindenburg that has made such allegations against the Adani Group. In August 2022, American finance and insurance company Fitch Group warned that the group had taken on too much debt and raised the possibility of a default “in the worst-case scenario”. However, the report also said the Adani Group draws “comfort” from its strong relationships with banks and India’s government. Indeed, the conglomerate has been described as being “too big to fail” for the Indian government.

In December, Quartz argued that any Adani company defaulting would damage not only the stock market but also the wider Indian economy. “The taxpayer will be hit, additionally, by her indirect exposure to the group, through LIC and the state-owned banks,” the business news platform said. “A bailout would limit the damage. That too would be funded by the public exchequer, but it would be unavoidable if the government decides that the Adani Group has indeed grown too big to be allowed to fail.”

The suggestion that the Modi government will have to act if the Adani Group needs rescuing is driven by concerns that the crisis will potentially spill over onto the Indian economy at large.

Not without reason. The stock crash has raised concerns about the high exposure of the public insurance company, LIC, to the Adani group and how it could risk the savings of middle-class Indians. The insurer has sought to alleviate such concerns saying its total exposure in the Adani Group companies is less than a percent of its total assets under management at book value, referring to the total market value of investments that an entity controls.

Some commentators, such as Bloomberg columnist Mihir Sharma, have raised concerns about whether the Adani Group, following this crisis, can deliver on key infrastructure projects with which it has been entrusted.

Reputational damage

Sharma also pointed out that one factor that distinguishes India from other emerging nations is the transparency of its markets and the quality of its market regulator. This crisis, he notes, is challenging that image. As a consequence, the Modi government cannot afford to mismanage the crisis.

On a similar note, Wall Street Journal columnist Megha Mandavia noted that the Indian government’s handling of the crisis will shape “foreign investors’ perception of the country’s attractiveness”. “Foreign investors, who hold a large chunk of the conglomerate’s sizable debt, may be reluctant to keep financing it until they are confident that the regulator has thoroughly assessed Hindenburg’s claims,” she argued.

The British Financial Times on Monday described the crisis as a “defining test for India Inc”. In its daily investment column on Wednesday, the newspaper said the relationship between Indian politicians and the business elite “is worryingly close”. However, it argued, “India can dispel negative interpretations of such ties by investigating the Adani affair thoroughly and with extensive public disclosure.”","Here’s how the crisis unfolded, how it might affect the Adani Group and the Indian economy at large.

Over the past few decades, India’s growth trajectory and the relationship between the state and private capital has shared traits with Latin America of the 1980s and Russia of the 1990s. For one, an ad-hoc pro-business policy has allowed a few companies to monopolise asset ownership. Second, there has been rent-seeking behaviour – adding wealth without contributing to productivity – at the top with the support of the government while cutting down on competition and the entry of new firms across sectors.

The rise of Adani Group has helped shape that trajectory, which is worrisome. In addition to Adani Group, headed by tycoon Gautam Adani, a few family-controlled conglomerates dominate the business scene in an opaque manner, potentially undermining the resilience of India’s corporate governance system and the regulatory structure.

Adani Group’s woes began on January 25 when Hindenburg Research, a US firm that conducts “forensic financial research”, released a report accusing the Indian conglomerate of serious malfeasance. It claimed that Adani had illegally used offshore investment funds and accounting fraud to boost share prices and group earnings.

Hindenburg has a reputation for being an “activist short seller”. It borrows the securities of companies it believes are overvalued because of alleged wrongdoing, anticipating that the price will fall. It sells these borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.

By the morning of January 27, Adani Group had lost $51 billion in market value. Over a week since the Hindenburg report was published, Adani Group’s losses continue to mount.

On February 2, the Adani Group cancelled a much-awaited fund-raising exercise that had closed the previous day, citing prevailing market conditions. It has now said it will return the money to investors.

State of private capital investment

Over the past decade, despite the continuous dip in domestic private investment across sectors in the country over the last decade, the Adani Group has soared like no other firm in India – and perhaps Asia. The five-year rise in Adani’s stock performance and asset ownership levels have trumped even Elon Musk’s Tesla and Jeff Bezos’s Amazon.

As a consequence, the Adani Group has been seen as the poster boy of India’s aggressive bullish run in the equity markets. This means that anything amiss with the company’s stock performance or macro-fundamentals is likely to affect both domestic and foreign business sentiment in India.

What does this unfolding situation say about the relationship between big private capital and the government in India?

Political economy questions

Political economist Atul Kohli, in his work on the politics of economic growth in India between 1980 and 2005, had a detailed insight on the dynamics of the political economy that shaped the growth trajectory during that period.

According to Kohli, India’s entry to the global economic landscape in the 1990s was a result of incremental, gradual reforms of the 1980s based on shifts in the relationship between state and private business.

One question was central to the pursuit of Kohli’s thesis: did India’s growth acceleration in the 1990s and 2000s result from the state’s embrace of pro-market policies or from a more complex but identifiable pattern of state intervention?

For many experts, the post-1991 period after the Narasimha Rao-led government’s economic liberalisation is viewed as part of the pro-market growth trajectory.

According to Kohli, the economic reforms of this period – undertaken more on the capital market side – allowed Indian markets to operate more flexibly in certain sectors (telecom, automobiles, aviation, information technology, construction, consumer goods, among them) with the aim of bringing in private investment opportunities.

From this period, India saw a strengthening of the “state-capital-private business” alliance, often at the cost of the social and economic protection to India’s deeply fragmented labour force.

The Adani-Narendra Modi alliance, based on a newly designed pro-business regulatory outlook emerging from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s rise to power at the national level, signals a similar dynamic.

The success of the “Gujarat growth model” that Modi effected as chief minister from 2001 to 2014 pivoted around the emergence of such linkages, driven by large infrastructure investment from companies like Adani Group. Ever since Modi was sworn in as prime minister in 2014, Adani Group’s national footprint has also grown significantly.

India's central bank (Reserve Bank of India) has asked local banks for details of their exposure to the Adani group of companies, government and banking sources, reports Reuters pic.twitter.com/EHxDfVNmhD — ANI (@ANI) February 2, 2023

As historian Adam Tooze noted on January 28, “Driving national infrastructure development, Adani personifies the oligarchic linkages and rentier profits generated by a licensing system for infrastructure on which Modi’s growth model has heavily relied.” Tooze means that the Adani Group’s ability to accrue and concentrate power and generate sustained profits without substantially adding to overall productivity is anchored in Modi’s growth model, which emphasises big infrastructure spending.

The growth of Adani Group – investing in acquiring ports and airports, for instance – has been driven by a cycle of rising equity values and corporate debt, particularly post 2020.

“Some argue the concentration of economic power in family-run conglomerates is a way to fast-track India’s economic development, like the chaebol did for post-war South Korea,” The Financial Times had noted back in 2020. Chaebol are large, family-run business conglomerates in South Korea.

In the state-big business compact of “New India”, the extent to which conglomerates like Adani Group are exposed to banks and insurance companies financed or supported by the exchequer (or tax money) requires greater scrutiny.

State-owned banks have already lent twice as much to the Adani Group than private banks. Of these, the State Bank of India, the country’s largest financier, has given loans of as much as Rs 260 crore to companies in the Adani conglomerate, Bloomberg reported.

The Life Insurance Corporation of India, in a public clarification, said its total holdings in Adani shares and debt was Rs 30,127 crore while the market value stood at Rs 56,142 crore after the plunge in Adani stocks as of January 27.

However, a few days before Adani Group’s shares began plunging, their market value in the Life Insurance Corporation’s books was a little over Rs 80,000 crore, according to journalist MK Venu. In just four days, the Life Insurance Corporation saw a portfolio loss of about Rs 23,735 crore, Venu noted. That is a large sum of money to lose for a company that has thousands of crores of long-term savings of average Indians pledged with it.

For the deeply divided (and unequal) corporate governance structure in India, driven by an ever-increasing concentration of business power and wealth inequality, there is a worrying lesson in Adani’s acquisition of dominant corporate power across sectors in only a few years.

It also exposes the structural challenges of the relationship between state-capital and private business in India, where a few family-controlled conglomerates with connections to the ruling party dominate business in an opaque manner, reflecting a disregard for regulatory scrutiny or the pre-established rules of doing business.

Worse, their financial exposure to public institutions and lenders such as state-owned banks or insurance companies pose a significant threat to the economy and ordinary Indians.

Bonds are considered distressed when their yields, which move inversely to prices, are at least 10 percentage points over those of comparable US Treasuries.

Closer home, equities of the conglomerate continued to tank as its flagship stock Adani Enterprises shares fell by 23.82% on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Shares of other group stocks also fell significantly – Adani Ports (7.23%), Adani Power (4.98%), Adani Transmission (10%), Adani Green Energy (10%), Adani Total Gas (10%) and Adani Wilmar (5%) to Rs 421.45.

This is the sixth consecutive trading session in which shares of the Adani Group continued to decline.

Meanwhile, bonds of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Limited registered the biggest loss in global secondary trading on Wednesday as they plunged 20 cents on the dollar to 69.75 cents. Similarly, at least four other bonds of Adani Ports plunged to distressed levels by dropping to 69 cents or lower.

Adani Green Energy’s bond fell more than 12 cents on the dollar to 66.75 cents in market trading. One bond of Adani Green declined 9 cents on the dollar but did not hit the distressed level.

This marks a stunning setback for Adani as some bonds of these two companies yield over 30% in secondary markets, which is way higher than the average investment grade yield of 4.96%, Mint reported.

On Wednesday, Adani Enterprises decided not to go ahead with a follow-on public offer of shares and return the money to investors.

“Today the market has been unprecedented, and our stock price has fluctuated over the course of the day,” Adani said. “Given these extraordinary circumstances, the company’s board felt that going ahead with the issue will not be morally correct.”

Shares in the billionaire’s conglomerate have plunged since United States-based short-seller Hindenburg Research on January 24 made wide-ranging allegations that the Adani Group was pulling off the “largest con in corporate history”.

It claimed that the conglomerate has over the decades been involved in stock manipulation, accounting fraud, used offshore shells for money laundering and siphoned money from listed companies.

Adani Group has invoked nationalism to defend itself and called the report a “calculated attack” on India and its institutions. Hindenburg, in turn, said that Adani Group cannot conceal its fraud by draping itself in the national flag.

Amid the crisis, US-based lender Citigroup has stopped extending margin loans to its clients against securities of the Adani Group, Bloomberg reported.

“In recent days, we have seen a dramatic price drop of Adani issued securities,” Citigroup said in an internal memo, according to Bloomberg. “Stock and bond prices have plummeted following the negative news around the group’s financial health.”

The development came after Swiss lender Credit Suisse stopped accepting bonds of Adani Group firms as collateral for margin loans, Bloomberg reported.","Shares of other group stocks also fell significantly – Adani Ports (7.23%), Adani Power (4.98%), Adani Transmission (10%), Adani Green Energy (10%), Adani Total Gas (10%) and Adani Wilmar (5%) to Rs 421.45.

The company said it is doing so after considering market volatility and added it would return the money to the investors.

A follow-on public offering is a process where a company raises funds by selling its shares to the public again.

The development comes a day after Adani Enterprises had announced that the follow-on public offering was oversubscribed. It was priced at Rs 3,112-3,276 per share.

Shares of the Adani Group are facing a rout that began soon after a report by United States-based firm Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation and improper use of offshore tax havens on January 24. Since then, investors in Adani stocks have lost over Rs 7 lakh crore.

Adani and Hindenburg have indulged in a war of words since the allegations. The conglomerate has called the report a “calculated attack” on India and its institutions.

On Wednesday, the conglomerate’s head Gautam Adani said that given the “extraordinary circumstances”, the company’s board felt that going ahead with the issue would not be morally correct.

“The interest of the investors is paramount and hence to insulate them from any potential financial losses, the board has decided not to go ahead with the FPO [follow-on public offering].”

Adani said that the decision will not have any impact on the company’s existing operations and future plans.

“Our balance sheet is very healthy with strong cashflows and secure assets, and we have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt,” Adani said. “We will continue to focus on long-term value creation and growth will be managed by internal accruals. Once the market stabilizes, we will review our capital market strategy.”

Adani vs Hindenburg

In its report, Hindenburg Research had said that it holds short positions in the Adani Group companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments. Short positions are “created when a trader sells a security first with the intention of repurchasing it or covering it later at a lower price”, according to Investopedia.

Investment research firms like Hindenburg often engage in “activist short selling”, or making information about companies public in order to trigger a fall in their share prices.

Soon after the report came out on Wednesday, Adani Group had called it “a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations”.

On Sunday, the conglomerate issued a 413-page response, in which it described the Hindenburg Research report as a “calculated attack” on India and its institutions. The Adani Group alleged that the mala fide intention of Hindenburg was apparent as the report was released ahead of a $2.5 billion share sale by its flagship firm Adani Enterprises.

“It is tremendously concerning that the statements of an entity sitting thousands of miles away, with no credibility or ethics has caused serious and unprecedented adverse impact on our investors,” the Adani Group said.

The report alleged that the conglomerate has over the decades been involved in stock manipulation, accounting fraud, used offshore shells for money laundering and siphoned money from listed companies.

The allegations listed by Hindenberg led to a massive drop in the prices of Adani stocks over the next few days. This in turn has raised concerns over the high exposure of state-owned insurance company, the Life Insurance Corporation, to Adani Group companies. Over the past few years, LIC has invested significantly in the Adani group, channeling millions of rupees of middle class savings into the conglomerate. Any sharp fall in Adani stock prices will now end up affecting the returns of millions of LIC policyholders.

Allegations against Adani Group

Hindenburg Research, following a two-year investigation, made wide-ranging allegations of the Adani Group being involved in corporate malpractice. It alleged that members of the Adani family had cooperated in creation of offshore shell entities in tax-havens such as Mauritius and generated forged import-export documents in an apparent effort to generate fake turnover and to siphon money from the listed companies. The research firm also alleged that some shells seemingly served several purposes such as stock parking or stock manipulation and money laundering.

Short sellers identify allegedly overvalued companies, borrow and sell their stocks at current market price and buy them back at a lower price in the future when the price has fallen, in order to make profit. To this end, activist short-sellers seek to expose such a company’s negative financial information.

This is not the first time questions have been raised about the Adani Group’s business practices. In August 2022, New York-based finance and insurance company Fitch Group’s CreditSights unit had warned of the Adani Group having taken on too much debt and raised the possibility of a default “in the worst-case scenario”. The report had, however, also said that the Adani Group draws “comfort” from its strong relationships with banks and the Indian government.

In July 2021, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary had informed Parliament that the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence were probing some Adani Group companies for alleged non-compliance with rules. Around the same time, Bloomberg reported that four companies then under the scanner for parking 90% of all their money in Adani Group firms had a history of investing in companies that ended up defaulting or were investigated for wrongdoing.

LIC’s ballooning investments in the conglomerate



Despite these concerns, the Union government-controlled LIC, has made significant investments in the Adani Group. The insurer accounts for over 98% of the entire insurance industry’s investment in the Adani Group.

In terms of the value, LIC’s holdings in Adani Group companies have reportedly multiplied 10 times since September 2020. From around Rs 7,300 crore of LIC’s equity assets under management in 2020, the value had ballooned to nearly Rs 72,200 crore as on Tuesday. “Assets under management” refers to the total market value of the investments that an entity controls.

In spite of the latest fraud allegations against the Adani Group, the LIC has not changed course. This week, it infused approximately Rs 300 crore into Adani Enterprises – the group’s flagship company.

The Adani Group’s companies facing a market rout this week following allegations made in the Hindenburg report, has raised concerns about the LIC’s high exposure to the conglomerate. Seven listed Adani Group companies have lost a total of $48 billion in share value since the report was published.

The LIC has significant stakes in Adani Group companies. In Adani Enterprises, the insurer holds 4.23% of the shares. Similarly, in Adani Ports, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmissions and Adani Green, the LIC holds 9.14%, 5.96%, 3.65% and 1.28% stakes, respectively.

The LIC reportedly lost more than Rs 16,500 crore from sell-off in these five Adani Group companies, in the two market sessions that happened after the report was published.

Implications for investors

LIC invests the money it receives from its investors into assets such as stocks. The returns generated from these assets in turn are paid back to investors. Given that an investor’s investment in LIC’s products are partially linked to the equity market, where LIC invests is a crucial determinant in a person’s returns.

Moreover, the size and scale of LIC make it a critical variable when it comes to the Indian middle class, which often depends on the company for critical products like post-retirement savings. LIC has a massive 250 million investors and the funds it manages are as large as the entire mutual fund industry.

Concerns around LIC’s poor investment decisions are not new and the company has long generated poor returns for its investors. However, this is the first time the public sector company’s investments are under a cloud for ploughing money into a private corporation.

Political heat

Given the size of the LIC policy holder pool, its investments in Adani has generated political heat. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on January 27 that LIC’s high exposure to the Adani Group has exposed people who have placed their savings into LIC to financial risk. “The high exposure of financial institutions such as the Life Insurance Company of India and the State Bank of India to the Adani Group has implications for financial stability and for the crores of Indians whose savings are stewarded by these pillars of the financial system,” he argued.

Sitaram Yechury, leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), similarly said if allegations made by Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group are correct, it would “destroy lives of crores of Indians who park lifelong savings in LIC and [the State Bank of India].”","This in turn has raised concerns over the high exposure of state-owned insurance company, the Life Insurance Corporation, to Adani Group companies.

“We also believe India’s future is being held back by the Adani Group, which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation,” Hindenburg Research said in a statement.

On Sunday, the conglomerate issued a 413-page response four days after the company published its report, leading to a steep fall in share prices of Adani Group companies. Over two trading sessions on Wednesday and Friday, 10 listed companies of the group, led by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, lost Rs 4.17 lakh crore in market capitalisation.

Adani, who was the world’s third richest person at the start of last week, was ranked number seven on the Forbes’ billionaires tracker after Friday’s trade. An hour into trading on Monday, the group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises was up 6.5% on the Bombay Stock Exchange, but several other stocks were losing up to 20%.

In its response on Sunday, the Adani Group alleged that the mala fide intention of Hindenburg was apparent as the report was released ahead of a $2.5 billion share sale by its flagship firm Adani Enterprises.

“It is tremendously concerning that the statements of an entity sitting thousands of miles away, with no credibility or ethics has caused serious and unprecedented adverse impact on our investors,” the Adani Group said.

It added that Hinderburg Research, by its own admission, is a short seller and claimed that its aim was to book massive financial gain through wrongful means.

In its report, Hindenburg Research had said that it holds short positions in the Adani Group companies through US traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments. Short positions are “created when a trader sells a security first with the intention of repurchasing it or covering it later at a lower price”, according to Investopedia.

The Adani Group also stated that the New York-based firm “has not published this report for any altruistic reasons but purely out of selfish motives and in flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws”. It asserted that the report was neither objective nor well-researched.

Hindenburg Research had said in its report that markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India had investigated and prosecuted over 70 entities for manipulating Adani stocks between 1999 and 2005. The Adani Group, however, said that there are no ongoing proceedings before SEBI in connection with the matter, and all past cases have been closed.

“We are neither aware of, nor are we required to be, aware of any proceedings against these other ‘entities and individuals’, who are not Adani promoters,” the corporate group said.

Hindenburg response

In its response on Monday, Hindenburg Research said the Adani Group had not given specific answers to 62 of the 88 questions the research firm had posed in its report last week.

“...It mainly grouped questions together in categories and provided generalised deflections,” Hindeburg said. “In other instances, Adani simply pointed to its own filings and declared the questions or relevant matters settled, again failing to substantively address the issues raised.”

The American company pointed out that Adani’s 413-page response consisted of “330 pages of court records, along with 53 pages of high-level financials, general information, and details on irrelevant corporate initiatives, such as how it encourages female entrepreneurship and the production of safe vegetables”.

Hindenburg claimed that Adani’s response had “largely confirmed” its findings and ignored key questions it had raised about stock manipulation and improper use of offshore tax havens.

Fraud Cannot Be Obfuscated By Nationalism Or A Bloated Response That Ignores Every Key Allegation We Raisedhttps://t.co/ohNAX90BDf — Hindenburg Research (@HindenburgRes) January 30, 2023

Hindenburg’s allegations

In its January 24 report, Hindenburg claimed that the Adani companies are on a “precarious financial footing”. It alleged that the conglomerate has amassed substantial debt by pledging overvalued shares.

The report noted that Gautam Adani’s net worth has risen by more than $100 billion (Rs 8.1 lakh crore) over the last three years, largely due to share prices of seven of his listed companies rising by an average of 819% during this period.

However, Hindenburg’s research said that the high valuation of the stocks do not augur well for their healthy financials as seven companies of the conglomerate have an 85% downside risk – a worst-case estimation of the potential loss in the share prices.

On Wednesday, the Adani Group said that the report was “a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations”. It said that it is considering “remedial and punitive” legal action against the United States-based company in connection with its allegations.

Hindenburg responded by saying that Adani had ducked the issues the firm had raised and instead resorted to “bluster and threats”.

An hour into trading on Monday, the group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises was up 6.5% on the Bombay Stock Exchange, but several other stocks were losing up to 20%.
In its report, Hindenburg Research had said that it holds short positions in the Adani Group companies through US traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.

With some of the stocks of the group falling by as much as 20%, the nine companies have lost more than Rs 4.20 lakh crore in market capitalisation since the markets closed on Tuesday, according to The Indian Express.

The sell-off had a broader impact on the Indian equity markets as investor wealth plummeted by more than Rs 12 lakh crore in just two trading sessions on Wednesday and Friday, the Business Standard reported. The markets were closed on Thursday on account of Republic Day.

In a report published on Wednesday, Hindenburg had claimed that key listed companies of the Adani Group are on a “precarious financial footing”. It also alleged that the conglomerate headed by India’s richest person, Gautam Adani, has amassed substantial debt by pledging overvalued shares.

The Adani stocks went on a spiral soon after markets opened for trading on Friday morning. At 3.25 pm, the group’s flagship company Adani Enterprises was down more than 18%. Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission were the worst performers as the stocks crashed by 20% each.

Adani Power (5%), Adani Ports (15.58%) and Adani Wilmar (5%) also faced significant losses. The overall 30-share BSE Sensex was down nearly 900 points, or 1.5%

Congress demands investigation

Meanwhile, the Congress on Friday demanded that the Reserve Bank of India and markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India should investigate into Hindenburg’s allegations against the Adani Group.

In a statement, Congress General Secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh expressed concerns, pointing out that public sector financial institutions like the Life Insurance Corporation and the State Bank of India have exposure to the Adani Group.

Ramesh claimed that 8% of the LIC’s equity assets, amounting to Rs 74,000 crore, are invested in Adani Group companies. Moreover, 40% of the loans advanced to the conglomerate have been from the SBI, the Congress MP said.

“These institutions have liberally financed the Adani Group even as their private sector counterparts have chosen to avoid investing because of concerns over corporate governance and indebtedness,” the statement noted.

Besides the huge losses in Adani shares, the bloodbath in the equity markets on Friday could also be attributed to sell-off in bank stocks as investors became wary of their exposure to the conglomerate, the Business Standard reported.

The Nifty Bank sub-index lost more than 3% in Friday’s trading as State Bank of India and ICICI Bank lost in excess of 4% each, while HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank were also among the stocks which registered highest losses.

In his statement, Ramesh claimed that the Narendra Modi-led central government and the group of companies headed by Adani have a “close relationship”.

“For all its posturing about black money, has the Modi government chosen to turn a blind eye towards illicit activities by its favourite business group?” he questioned.

What has happened since the Hindenburg report?

In its report, Hindenburg Research had said that it holds short positions in the Adani Group companies through US traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments. Short positions are “created when a trader sells a security first with the intention of repurchasing it or covering it later at a lower price”, according to Investopedia.

Investment research firms like Hindenburg often engage in “activist short selling”, or making information about companies public in order to trigger a fall in their share prices.

Responding to the allegations, the Adani Group had said on Wednesday that the report was “a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations”.

On Thursday, the Adani Group issued another media statement, saying that the report was “maliciously mischievous” and “unresearched” and that it had adversely affected the conglomerate, its shareholders and investors.

Hindenburg Research, however, has defended the report, saying that it stands by it. On Thursday, the research firm said that Adani Group has resorted to bluster and threats instead of answering the issues raised.

And what is the reason for his optimism? Hear it from him

In 2006, I researched and wrote a paper for the Cato Institute on Gujarat's new strategy of port-based development . This strategy was launched by Congress chief minister Chimanbhai Patel in the early 1990s and expanded by BJP successors. I visited Gautam Adani 's new Mundra port and was struck by its high automation and speed. I was astounded to hear that it financially compensated any ship that was not admitted and unloaded on schedule. While working in Mumbai in 1990, I had seen ships wait 20 days for port entry. So, Mundra seemed to be on another planet.The Hindenburg Research report has alleged vast price rigging and fraud by Adani companies. The charges are serious. Global investors have stampeded out of Adani shares. We need a thorough investigation, and punishment of the guilty.Let me raise a separate linked issue. Adani's critics say he shot to riches not through skills but manipulation and political favours, minting money in cosy monopolies. I disagree. Going from humble origins to global No. 3 in two decades is impossible without exceptional business skills.Critics accuse BJP of 'giving' Adani valuable assets , from ports and mines to airports and transmission lines. No. What the government initially gave Adani was the right to operate a minor port in the Kutch desert without even a rail connection. To convert this desert patch into India's largest port is close to miraculous.Adani has also acquired jetties and ports in a dozen other locations, beating global giants like Maersk and Dubai World in competitive auctions. He is incomparably India's top port operator, handling an estimated quarter of total Indian freight. This makes him a national champion.So, GoI is backing him to acquire strategic jetties and ports in Sri Lanka and Israel. Critics call this a favour. Really? The Sri Lanka terminal will cost $750 million and Haifa Port $1.18 billion. No Indian rival would dare risk so much even if offered on a platter. Adani's skills have made him a strategic player, more than just a businessman.A port is no cosy monopoly. It has to compete in logistics and pricing to woo ships from established rivals. Mundra's logistics have attracted business investments of thousands of crores, creating an industrial hub in the desert. It has the world's largest automated coal-handling facility. A 2017 Morgan Stanley report puts Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) in the top 25% of global port companies.Critics focus on government favours to Adani. In India, business success requires good management of not only factories but politics too. All businessmen cosy up to politicians. But while this opens doors and overcomes some rules, it cannot guarantee success. Anil Ambani is often accused by Rahul Gandhi of getting ₹30,000 crore in defence deals. Yet, he has flopped commercially.Once, Dhirubhai Ambani was also accused of political manipulation and boondoggles. He responded, 'What have I done that every other businessman has not?' There was no reply. Other businessmen, many with formidable historical advantages, had also wooed politicians and fiddled books. For a newcomer like Dhirubhai to beat the old giants at their own game signified immense talent. Something similar can be said of Adani.Dhirubhai's dubious acts are detailed in Hamish McDonald's 1998 book, The Polyester Prince. But critics are dead wrong to think that he was just a successful manipulator. During the licence-permit raj, manipulation was inescapable. But once the economy was liberalised, he built the world's largest export-oriented oil refinery with operating margins higher than even Singapore's famed refineries, proving himself world class. He got favours in telecom but created the cheapest telephone network in the world. Those who focus only on his manipulation are blind to the phenomenal skills that made him a historical titan , warts and all. Adani is treading a similar path.Critics say Adani deals mainly in infrastructure where cosiness to the government matters more than true skills. No. Dozens of new tycoons with strong regional political clout joined the infrastructure boom of 2003-08. But despite having political godfathers, many ran into trouble and went bust, leaving banks with enormous unpaid debts. Success in infrastructure requires skill, not just political friends.Readers may think I am a great Adani fan. But I do not own any Adani company shares because of high prices and high risk. Adani has been diversifying and expanding at breakneck speed using borrowed money, bidding very high prices in auctions and acquisitions. This facilitates fast expansion, but carries great risks. History has examples aplenty of business titans who diversified crazily to create giant conglomerates, succeeded for a few decades amid applause, but eventually came a cropper (like General Electric under Jack Welch).So, I think the Hindenburg report may be the best thing that ever happened to Adani. It will slow his speed of expansion and diversification, and force his financiers to be diligent and cautious in future. This could impose highly desirable financial discipline on Adani, to his own benefit. Hindenburg may have been a blessing in disguise - or, in Winston Churchill's words in response to his wife trying to cheer him up after his post-war electoral defeat, a blessing 'quite effectively disguised'.One day I might actually buy Adani shares.","Swami Speaks: Dhirubhai Ambani had beaten old school business boys, Adani probably better at it The Hindenburg report may be the ""best thing"" that ever happened to billionaire Gautam Adani, says Swaminathan Aiyar.
