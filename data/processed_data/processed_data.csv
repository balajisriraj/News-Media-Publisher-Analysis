airship flying into New Jersey caught fire and crashed killing 35 passengers on board It was sort of a manmade disaster as some 100 people were loaded on to a balloon filled with the most flammable material in the universe The airship was named Hindenburg Eight decades later in 2017 a graduate of international business management from the University of Connecticut founded a forensic financial research firm to specialise in spotting wrongdoings and frauds or what it calls manmade disasters at companies around the globe and take market bets against them Founder Nathan Nate Anderson named his firm Hindenburg ResearchLast week a report from Hindenburg Research on Indian tycoon Gautam Adani s business empire sparked a USD 51 billion selloff in shares of his group companies pushing him four places down on the world billionaire index The report said that the Adani Group had engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades The disclosure came just ahead of Adani Enterprises  Rs 20000 crore open offer of shares to investorsAdani group has since rubbished the report as a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale baseless and discredited allegations That however hasnt stopped investors from selling offOn Friday shares of Adani Group companies continued their loosing streak for the second day with Adani Enterprises dropping a massive 185 per cent and Adani Ports  SEZ 16 per cent taking the broader benchmark index  the Sensex  down by 87416 points or 145 per centHindenburg engages in activist short selling which involves selling borrowed stocks in hopes of buying at a lower price later If prices fall expectedly short sellers make a killingHindenburg which invests its own capital takes such bets based on its research which looks for manmade disasters such as accounting irregularities mismanagement and undisclosed relatedparty transactionsIt especially looks for accounting irregularities bad actors in management or key service provider roles undisclosed relatedparty transactions illegalunethical business or financial reporting practices and undisclosed regulatory product or financial issues in companiesWhile we use fundamental analysis to aid our investment decisionmaking we believe the most impactful research results from uncovering hardtofind information from atypical sources the company

targeted by the activists have been pushing regulators to go after these short sellers as they may be indulging in some sort of insider trading Supporters however say that the research actually uncover frauds and do more good than harm to investorsNot much is known about the company besides its 38yearold founder Anderson who lived in Jerusalem Israel before returning to the US where he first took up a consulting job with a financial data company FactSet and then worked at broker dealer firms in Washington DC and New YorkBefore he founded Hindenburg Anderson worked with Harry Markopolos who had flagged Bernie Madoffs Ponzi scheme to investigate Platinum Partners a hedge fund that was eventually charged with fraud worth USD 1 billionWhile living in Jerusalem Anderson volunteered for a local ambulance serviceHindenburg is best known for its bet against electric truck maker Nikola Corp in September 2020 for its alleged lies and deceptions in years leading up to its proposed partnership with General MotorsAmong dozens of other issues it challenged a promotional video Nikola produced showing its electric truck cruising at high speed This it said was nothing more than a truck being rolled down a hill in the Utah desert a claim the company later admitted and its founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton resigningNikola which agreed in 2021 to pay USD 125 million to settle a case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission listed in June 2020 and its valuation touched USD 34 billion at peak but is now worth USD 134 billionHindenburgs website lists over a dozen companies where it has flagged alleged wrongdoings These include WINS Finance which Hindenburg revealed had failed to disclose to US investors an RMB 350 million asset freeze imposed on one of its subsidiaries in China the zombie company China Metal Resources Utilization which had a 100 per cent downside and was under severe financial distress with numerous accounting irregularities SC Worxs completely bogus Covid19 testing deal massive undisclosed related party transactions including a USD 509 million merger at HF Foods billions of dollars in undisclosed offbalance sheet liabilities of Bloom Energy and a whistleblower report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC relating to RD Legal a hedge fund that was later charged by the commission for allegedly making material misstatements to its investorsAlmost all of Hindenburgs work has been followed up by legal or regulatory action according to its websiteTo take a short position investors sell borrowed stock in hopes of buying it back at a lower price later If prices fall expectedly they make a killing If the price rises instead they would have to buy stock to cover what they borrowedShort sellers however

choice We will not try and influence that We definitely think there is merit in the group and we think the longer term prospects remain very robust One cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt I would definitely advocate a buy at least in the FPO and I would say Ambuja and the ports are looking very attractive at this price says DirectorWell that is a million dollar question One report from five analysts who I have never heard of Hindenburg comes and upsets the market They come on the expiry day and tell them that they are short It is all concerted Whatever the outcome it tells us how insider trading is very open right now In fact SEBI and stock exchanges should look to who had initiated this and where was the call writing and put and hence the option marketOn Wednesday out of a turnover of Rs 400 lakh crore Rs 300 lakh crore was just the option But on a more neutral note the group has very good assets and there is no sovereign risk over here LIC  the other banks which I see no problem with There is always going to be uncertainty when a group has made its market cap past Rs 20 lakh crore in the last five years but it is on the back of businesses which are there So the debate is openIn a global context India has underperformed this month and now is time to put your money where your mouth is I do not see any changes coming on the LTCG on the negative side and if anything there can be more proponents on capex and other things because the government is sitting on a much better balance sheet than before I would say this is the lull before the storm of buying what you want because what the money had to go to China has already gone I would definitely give Adani a subscribe over here A disclosure we have no holdings in AdaniLook at the top gainers  Bajaj Auto Tata Motors  Mahindra  Mahindra Hero The numbers from the auto side are excellent When an economy turns the first two sectors to turn are cement and auto and there are no two ways I think Ambuja is a steal at this priceAside from that the holding company Adani Enterprise and Adani Ports Adani Ports would be arguably the third best port in the world So ignoring the corporate issues and the debt we all know there are no such hidden things Every six months something comes up like that and one can see the prerogative is the derailing the FPOThere are pros and cons but this is very well orchestrated where the option side is telling you that insiders had already taken position and perpetrated its report The outcome of that is the market for you But I definitely think cement autos are telling you that the economy has turned and if anything the Budget could be a trend setter and this is a very good time to buy select stocks definitelyWhere have you seen 30 falls in two days Now whether it is perpetrated or not there are sovereign funds there are enough people who have committed to the FPO So it is a needle where you have to see whether you can ignore the noise and put your money in something which is giving you value but it is the investor s choice We will not try and influence that We definitely think there is merit in the group and we think the longer term prospects remain very robust You cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt Also I think all their businesses are in fine shape I would definitely advocate a buy at least in the FPO and I would say Ambuja and the ports are looking very attractive at this priceDisclaimer Recommendations suggestions

had launched a 15000 crore FPO But circumstances changed drastically a few days before Adanis FPO and it would be Hindenburg Researchs report under which it accused Adani of stock manipulation and fraud schemes In its report on January 24 the New Yorkbased investment research firm said we reveal the findings of our 2year investigation presenting evidence that the 178 trillion 218 billion Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades Hindenburgs report indicated that Gautam Adani Founder and Chairman of the Adani Group has amassed a net worth of roughly 120 billion adding over 100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group s 7 key listed companies which have spiked an average of 819 in that period The findings of Hindenburgs research report on Adani involved interactions with dozens of individuals including former senior executives of Adani and also reviewing thousands of documents and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries Also the research said even if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value its 7 key listed companies have 85 downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to skyhigh valuations Adani companies debt was also among the key factors that Hindenburg pointed out It said key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans putting the entire group on precarious financial footing 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported current ratios below 1 indicating nearterm liquidity pressure Hindenburgs research note came as a shock and Adani stocks went into frenzied selling Although Adani has denied Hindenburgs accusations On January 27th Adani Enterprises filed a presentation covering Adani Group s response to Hindenburg Report It was titled Myths of Short Seller Hindenburg is the short seller According to Adanis presentation Hindenburg asked 89 questions in total While some of these questions are in regards to the groups related party transactions DRI Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and court cases However there are 21 questions in total that cannot be claimed to be the result of any investigation over a 2year period or any such assertion as they were disclosed in public documents all the way back from 2015 onwards Further Adani said 8 of 9 listed companies have a big 6 auditor such as Deloitte Haskins  Sells SRBC  Co EY SRBC  Co EY  Dharmesh Parikh  Co Joint Auditors Shah Dhandharia  Co Ernst  Young PKF Walker Chandiok  Co and K S Rao  Co etc Moreover on the leverage issue Adani mentioned 100 of its various companies are rated  these account for nearly 100 of its EBITDA Also in regards to revenue or balance sheet being artificially inflated or managed it said out of 9 listed companies in Adani portfolio  6 are subject to specific sector regulatory review for revenue costs and capex Meanwhile in terms of governance 4 of Adanis large companies are in the top 7 of the peer group in Emerging markets or the sector or the world On LAS position Adani said overall promoter leverage is less than 4 of promoter holding Earlier on January 25 Jugeshinder Singh Group CFO Adani said We are shocked that Hindenburg Research has published a report on 24 January 2023 without making any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India s highest courts The timing of the report s publication clearly betrays a brazen mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming Followon Public Offering from Adani Enterprises the biggest FPO ever in India Singh added Also on January 26 Jatin Jalundhwala Group Head  Legal Adani said the maliciously mischievous unresearched report published by Hindenburg Research on 24 Jan 2023 has adversely affected the Adani Group our shareholders and investors The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens Nevertheless the panic selloffs in these seven stocks have led to a massive correction in Gautam Adanis net worth Asias richest mans wealth is to the tune of 927 billion as of January 28 As per Bloomberg Billionaire Index Adanis net worth has dropped by 208 billion at the latest However yeartodate Adanis wealth has dipped by 279 billion,On Friday Adani Transmission Adani Green Energy and Adani Total Gas closed at 20 lower circuits eachIf Adanis FPO is fully subscribed

The Economic Times,,No large shareholder has exited Adani Group huge promoter debt unsubstantiated speculation says CFO Jug,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/no-large-shareholder-has-exited-adani-group-huge-promoter-debt-unsubstantiated-speculation-says-cfo-jugeshinder-singh/articleshow/97434436.cms,No large shareholder has exited Adani Group huge promoter debt unsubstantiated speculation says CFO Jugeshinder Singh  Every week on average our portfolio,None,No large shareholder has exited Adani Group huge promoter debt unsubstantiated speculation says CFO Jugeshinder Singh, A lot of large institutional investors are longterm strategic infra intergenerational investors They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities  public companies nine we have now are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in India Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement says Group CFOI will answer the second part first Have we seen the exit of any large shareholders From the data that we have as of the week the answer is no A lot of large institutional investors are longterm strategic infra intergenerational investors They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities  public companies nine we have now are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in IndiaThose entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement Therefore we do not expect it and neither has there been any movement in the longterm strategic investors and positionsOn the first part of the question  yes we saw shortterm volatility and the share prices have consequently changed but again because the fundamental business has not altered in any way we believe that this volatility will pass In a weeks time our quarterly results will come out and people will see that the group continues on its upward trend and therefore we believe that over a period of time it will be seen that we are a core infra utilities platform and therefore on a weekly basis our cash flows do not alterSo to give you an example here every week on average our portfolio makes about Rs 1100 crore This Sunday also that number was achieved Next Sunday it will be the same the following Sunday it will be the same We believe that it will become clear to investors that this shortterm volatility will be addressed as we go through over the next few monthsAs correctly highlighted even in this report I could not find anything with assets and performance of our businesses So they talk about promoter level debt We hardly borrow on a corporate basis At promoter level also we do not borrow much At a promoter level we are net lenders to the market Therefore on a corporate basis also we do not have much debt On a promoter basis as I explained we are net lenders So it is a completely unsubstantiated speculation that we have huge amounts of debt at promoter levelWe are one of the few groups that formally declare total pledge positions on a regular basis quarterly It goes out as part of our credit report which goes to all investors or banking partners or shareholders even independent directors So the informed investor is very clear that we do not have this This report to that extent is mere speculation on that point of debtOn other aspects we will discuss but as we go through this period it has to be recognised and I would like to clarify for the public that for our large companies say Adani Transmission or Adani Port or Adani Green or Adani Total Gas  their credit profile is similar to that of the government sovereign companies We are the highest rated infrastructure portfolio in the country with the exception of the Government of India This has to be seen in that context We are very comfortable with this and we believe that it is a completely unsubstantiated rumour mongering though it affects us temporarilyFalseNo it is nothing to do Our promoter shareholding is both for India and we hold some of our shares from overseas In our Holcim transaction when we issued an open offer document the entire structure of our overseas holding was fully disclosed Our domestic holding structure has been disclosed in public documents for investors for the past 12 yearsTherefore for anything beyond that we are fully disclosed in our offering documents for investors for regulators and for everybody It is mere speculation and we cannot answer to speculation because this holding structure from family trust intermediate companies and companies that hold shares domestically be it Dubai to Mauritius is fully disclosed in a comprehensive manner Therefore they have made speculative charges that we control or do not control some companyThey raised a specific question We have addressed this in our rebuttal to that report Now this is a specific question they asked They said that in relation to Carmichael Rail and I am aware of this because this is part of AEL we transferred an asset to a private company and then the private company immediately wrote down the value of their asset So their implication is we over inflated Adani Enterprise revenue by writing off the asset in a private company Now this charge is of malicious nature and that is my media statement because I knew this at that point in time alsoThis is the malicious nature of this report which is borderline lying and it is certainly a misrepresentation First we actually disclosed these ourselves that this is a related party transaction Then we disclosed fully how the transaction was done Now if somebody claims to have done two years of research they would have known that this asset when you are transferred had its accounting treatment known in Adani Enterprise They could have seen from the same note that in Adani Enterprise we had already written down the value of the assets and charged it to the PL as a loss They knew this and yet they still published this questionI am assuming they know this because they claim to have done two years of research Now if they did not know this then it is just purely ignorant and malicious If they have knowingly done this it is a case of genuine falsehoods and misrepresentation So this is a clear example which we have highlighted and we have made public in our response which is well over 400 pages fully annotated and we have attached the documents so people can verify themselves that 68 out of 88 are these types of questions they have askedWe borrow very little at the promoter level and we declare it and therefore the coverage that we have in relation to that borrowing is we have cash to actually pay the borrowings full stop Therefore it is completely baseless that there were margin costs Before margin cost we will just pay and borrow and completely retire the shareholder lossThe FPO is as you know is a threepart process and we deliberately selected the FPO because we wanted to make sure and achieve certain outcomes broader institutional participation broader analyst coverage and actually broader HNI and retail participationIn the current situation or due to the volatility on Friday the FPO price is below the retail target price So we expect retail participation We will wait to see how it goes but the long term investors see the value of the Adani Enterprise differently and they are fully committed for the FPO and we have no information that that has changedTherefore we are moving ahead because we believe that with our institutional and strategic investor base the offer will anyway be fully subscribed Now once and that is why we clarify that the FPO is proceeding as normal and the reason the confidence comes is because of the way longterm investors look at AEL value AEL value is not in the share price of AEL It is just a holding valueThe real value of AEL is in incubating assets like Adani Airports Adani Data Centre business Adani new industry green hydrogen business Adani Roads Adani Digital Labs Adani Wilmar and mining services business Those businesses are still performing as they are and they still have the same value Now that value will be exercised when we demerge this business in the next four to six yearsSo longterm strategic investors is what they are aiming for and that value has not changed because that is not representative of the AEL The AEL share price is not representative of that value fully it is a discounted value So longterm investors are comfortable with the underlying value Retail investors will see some pull back but even some ultra HNI and HNI will participateCorrect Our objective on the retail investor base is twofold one we want to spread out the share register which is our objective and which we expect to complete by 20252026 Now in the short term naturally some change will happen because of the possible pullback of retail investors but it is very important for us to understand what we want to do for the retail investorWe are in infra and being an assetbased company it is very important that the Indian public owns its own assets It would be good for the person going to Mumbai airport to own some shares because it is their asset it is the assets of India Indian public must participate and we want to encourage that participation It is a bit of a disappointment that there will be some pullback but in the longer term we believe our objective to continue to encourage Indian retail investors will pay dividends and the wealth creation that Indian investors retail investors should enjoy from Indian assets will occur That is one of the key objectives of our founder and that the public should participate in the wealth creation of hard real assets in the countryYes Gujarat Ambuja shares were never pledged and we had clarified at that time also that it was a representation based on the very technical definition that Sebi has the shares are never pledged The way the acquisition of that nature is accomplished is that we tell our bankers and debt capital providers that we will hold a minimum number of shares and not the value of sharesSo we are not sellers of our equity and we said we will own 63 odd of Ambuja shares which we own So it is not a loan against shares not pledged in any way It is a security package which is different from pledge but that is counted in encumbrance by SEBI and that is why there was some misunderstanding and people misreported that as pledgeIt is not for us to give a discount It is important for us that there is a value equation here and that is based on the sum of parts of real assets being developed We very carefully evaluated the events of last week and the consensus feedback was that you please go ahead as planned and that is what we are doingWe are in a position where last week we made an EBITDA portfolio level of Rs 1100 crore Next week it would be the same and the week after that would be the same We are a nondiscretionary consumer spending portfolio Therefore underlying businesses are as they are  super high credit quality massive cash flows and therefore underlying business even their growth trajectory is not impacted by this let alone anything else,Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement says Group CFOI will answer the second part firstIt is just a holding valueThe real value of AEL is in incubating assets like Adani Airports Adani Data Centre business Adani new industry green hydrogen business Adani Roads Adani Digital Labs Adani Wilmar and mining services businessThe AEL share price is not representative of that value fully it is a discounted valueRetail investors will see some pull back but even some ultra HNI and HNI will participateCorrectIt is a bit of a disappointment that there will be some pullback but in the longer term we believe our objective to continue to encourage Indian retail investors will pay dividends and the wealth creation that Indian investors retail investors should enjoy from Indian assets will

third straight session on Monday with majority of them witnessing a crash yet againThe deepening market rout has now led to losses worth 65 billion in the groups stock values according to a Reuters reportThe current round of fall follows a report by Hindenburg Research last week which flagged concerns about the conglomerates debt levels and the use of tax havensOn Monday Adani Transmission dropped 1491 Adani Green by 20 Adani Total Gas by 20 Adani Power by 5 and Adani Wilmar by 5However shares of flagship Adani Enterprises climbed 421 after its follow on public offer FPO was subscribed 2The developments also had an impact on the stock market which remained volatile during the entire session Benchmark BSE sensex gyrated nearly 1000 points intraday before staging a smart comeback in late trades on selective buyingAdani Groups lengthy weekend rebuttal to Hindenburgs report did little to soothe investor sentiments today The 3day selloff has now erased nearly 65 billion market value amid a share sale by Adani s flagship that was meant to underline the tycoon s ascension on the global stageWhile the Adani Group has portrayed Hindenburg s allegations as baseless and an attack against India itself the latter s report is reviving longstanding investor concerns about the conglomerate s corporate governanceThe saga also threatens to weaken broader confidence in India until recently a top investment destination for Wall Street and accelerate a nascent shift toward a reopening ChinaThe selloff is also fast eroding the wealth of Adani Asia s richest man after his stocks were some of the best performers last year not just in the local market but also on the broader MSCI Asia Pacific IndexFrom being the 4th richest in the global billionaire rankings till Wednesday last week Adani has now dropped to the 8th spot with a total net worth of 882 billion as per the Forbes real time billionaires list However the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows Adani at 7th spot with a wealth of 927 billionThis is in sharp contrast to September last year when Adanis wealth had surged to over 155 billion making him the 2nd richest person in global billionaires ranking and the first Indian and Asian to break into the top 3 listIn a little over two and half years Gautam Adani s wealth had galloped over 13 times In January 2020 just before the onset of Covid pandemic his net worth was about 10 billionIn 1988 Gautam Adani had set up Adani Enterprises then Adani Exports to start a commodities trading business Soon he set up Mundra port for captive exportimport operations Within a decade it also emerged as the biggest coal trading company in the country and one of Indias largest foreign exchange earnersThe Adani group had on Sunday slammed the Hindenburg report and likened the damning allegations to a calculated attack on India its institutions and growth story saying the allegations are nothing but a lieNeedless to say that Hindenburg has created these questions to divert the attention of its target audience while managing its short trades to benefit at the cost of investors the group saidThe Gautam Adaniled group also said that the report is selective and manipulative presentation of matters already in public domain to caste a false narrativeThey also claimed that the Hindenburg report is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securitiesSome 65 of the 88 questions posed by Hindenburg are based on Adani s public disclosures and the conduct of the American short seller is nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law Adani Group statement saidThe group further reiterated that it will exercise rights to pursue remedies to safeguard our stakeholders before all appropriate authoritiesThe Adani Groups response comes ahead of the final few days of a 25 billion share sale by Adani Enterprises which received overall subscriptions of 1 on FridayMala fide intention is apparent given its timing when Adani Enterprises is undertaking the largest equity FPO the group statedUS short seller Hindenburg Research rejected Adani Groups charge that its report was an attack on India saying a fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism or a bloated response that ignored response to key allegationsCommenting on the 413page response Hindenburg said it believed India was a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future and it was Adani Group which was holding it back through systematic lootHindenburg stood by its last weeks report that said its twoyear investigation found Adani Group engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decadesHindenburg said the response by the conglomerate run by Asias richest man Gautam Adani opened with the sensationalistic claim that we are the Madoffs of ManhattanHindenburg responded saying Adani Group predictably tried to lead the focus away from substantive issues and instead stoked a nationalist narrativeAdani Group has attempted to conflate its meteoric rise and the wealth of its chairman Gautam Adani with the success of India itself it saidWe disagree To be clear we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future We also believe Indias future is being held back by Adani Group which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically

neighbourhood,February 04 2023 0914 pm  Updated February 05 2023 1001 am IST  NEW DELHI Caught between a row over the price of coal and this week s crash in its share valuations and credit ratings the Adani Power project planned as a major Indian infrastructure push to provide electricity to Bangladesh may be delayed by another six months local reports said The project is one of a number in the neighbourhood  including those in Bangladesh Sri Lanka Nepal and Myanmar  that have accompanied the Narendra Modiled government s Neighbourhood First initiative in the past few years Highlighting the bigticket announcements Adani chairperson Gautam Adani has met with regional leaders including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in September 2022 and thenSri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa while Adani family members have met with senior officials from Myanmar and even Indonesia However with the group s slide in fortunes and the cancellation of the Adani Enterprises FPO governments in neighbouring countries are watching the company s market situation closely even as the Ministry of External Affairs MEA made it clear that any setback to projects would not affect ties emphasising that the Adani stock s fall was not a foreign policy issue  If a certain project is not working for financial or economic reasons I don t think that s a reflection on the relationship MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday Project delayed again He was responding to questions about the controversy surrounding an Adani thermal power project in Jharkhand s Godda which was due to supply electricity for Bangladesh starting from January 2022 a deadline that has already been delayed twice According to the United News of Bangladesh s report quoting government officials which has not been denied the Bangladesh Power Development Board BPDB has written to Adani Power demanding that they reduce the price of coal to be purchased from Adani s Carmichael Mines in Australia Presently Adani Power is reportedly billing Bangladesh 400 per metric tonne far higher than the 250MT rate that BPDB is paying at its other thermal plants The Adani Group did not respond to requests for a comment from The Hindu but it is understood that unless BPDB sends a demand note for procuring the coal the Godda project transmission will be delayed further State officials quoted in a number of local reports say that the project s prime lenders Stateowned Power Finance Corp PFC and Rural Electrification Corp REC would then have to sign off on the delay MIngling corporatenational interests Other Adani projects in the region have also been in the limelight for various controversies including in Myanmar where the Adani group exited a 290 Yangon river port project in 2022 after the threat of US sanctions In Sri Lanka an uproar had followed the leak of a November 2021 letter from the Ceylon Electricity Board s thenchairman MMC Ferdinando to the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry asking them to allow an Adani proposal for a 500 MW wind energy project off the coast of Mannar and to treat it as a proposal from the Government of India to Sri Lanka  When asked about this during a parliamentary committee meeting Mr Ferdinando who later recanted his words said that he had been summoned by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who told him that he was under pressure from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to okay the Adani proposal Mr Rajapaksa denied the allegation and Mr Ferdinando resigned in June 2022 after withdrawing his statement Officials told The Hindu that the government is watching developments in the wake of the latest trouble for the Adani Group given that Sri Lanka which is in the middle of a financial crisis is hoping to see more infrastructure investment from India Apart from renewable energy the Adani Group has also begun construction on the 700 million Colombo port project for the West Container Terminal and officials said that they are not concerned at the moment as the funding for the port is on a strong footing  Adani forays seen as push by India Meanwhile officials in Nepal are also tracking developments in the Adani saga given the group s plans to lay transmission lines to connect hydropower projects in Nepal to a planned South Asian renewable energy grid Such a grid would provide power from Nepal and Bhutan to India Bangladesh and possibly Sri Lanka in the future After Nepal PM Sher Bahadur Deuba s visit to Delhi last year when he and Mr Modi had issued a joint vision statement on energy cooperation Adani Group officials had visited Nepal with a particular interest in hydropower projects in the Karnali Basin However they have not made any announcement yet possibly given the recent change in government Definitely people in Nepal are interested in the developments around the Adani group as the group is seen as close to the current Indian administration and their forays into Nepal were generally viewed as part of a push by the Indian establishment  said Sujeev Shakya a business consultant and founderchair of the Nepal Economic Forum The Adani Group declined requests from The Hindu for a comment on the sustainability of project financing in the neighbourhood especially given the current developments In a region where energy and connectivity are in high demand India s neighbours will be particularly interested in how quickly the group can stabilise its position in order to procure funding for its projects,The project is one of a number in the neighbourhood  including those in Bangladesh Sri Lanka Nepal and Myanmar  that have

Power Maharashtra Ltd APML and Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd APRL and Maharashtra Eastern Grid Power Transmission Company Limited MEGPTCL the Mumbaibench of CESTAT upheld the adjudicating authority s order in favour of AdaniThe DRI has filed a civil appeal before the apex court against the CESTAT order on APML and APRL in November court filings showMeanwhile sources told ET a similar appeal is likely to be filed against MEGPTCL too The department has also sent a proposal to CBIC the department s parent to appeal against the Tribunals order before the apex court A legal view will be taken before moving the SC said a government official privy to the development These sources also pointed out that no fresh evidence can be submitted before the apex court and the appeal is only on points of law and factOther than the entities the appeal also names three individuals including Vinod Shantilal Shah alias Vinod Shantilal Adani court documents accessed by ET states The appeal was filed on November 11 and the matter was further listed on December 16 In May 2014 the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence  DRI  had issued SCN to APML and APRL alleging overvaluationIn August 2017 the Adjudicating authority of DRI ie the same authority who issued the SCN after dealing with in detail set aside all the allegations and dropped the SCN It has been held by the Adjudicating Authority that all the imports were genuine being undertaken at arm s length and concluded that the value declared is correct and the value is not required to be redetermined had dropped the SCN and had given a favourable order in the matterOn appeal by Customs Department CESTAT Mumbai in July 2022 dismissed the appeal filed by Customs Department and upheld the Order of Adjudicating Authority The matter has not yet been listed for hearing spokesperson for Adani group told ETThe Hidenburg report that has hit Adani group stock had mentioned the DRI investigation The total mcap of the group has declined to Rs 10 lakh crore on February 3 2023 from Rs 192 lakh crore as of January 24 2023Responding to the alleged involvement of Adani family members in instances of roundtripping of diamond consignments at grossly inflated values to and from India the group in a press release slamming the report had said Certain allegations concerning diamond exports have all been closed by the Customs Excise And Service Tax Appellate Tribunal CESTAT in our favour This decision has been further confirmed by the Supreme Court itself twice over a fact which has been deliberately ignored and concealed in the Hindenburg report which contemptuously raises questions on the competence of the appellate tribunal with baseless claims that it has ignored evidence the group saidIn July 2021  after minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the DRI is investigating certain entities belonging to the Adani Group  the conglomerate approached the CESTAT seeking early hearing on the matter saying it had been getting enquiries from independent directors auditors financial institutions and lenders about the status of the caseIn July 2022 the tribunal in its order observed that the department s case pertaining to alleged overvaluation is based on certain documents received from the foreign branches of the Indian banks which were not certified as per the conditions prescribed under Section 138 C 4 of the Customs ActThe tribunal also observed that the investigation carried out by the DRI was incomplete  The tribunal opined that while the department submitted the documents received from the Indian banks it failed to make the foreign banks join the probe since the department could not interrogate or make Standard Chartered Bank join the investigation cannot be a reason to ignore the possibility of it acting as an active banker on behalf of EIF the offshore entity for the purpose of remitting the amount of original equipment manufacturer said the tribunal order The burden was on the department to prove why the total remittance amount was only through these two banks and no other bank It therefore follows that the investigations carried out by the revenue was incomplete the order saidOn March 15 2014 the DRI sent a common show cause notice alleging that EIF an entity based in Dubai Adani Power Maharashtra Ltd APML and Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd APRL were related entities for the rweason that EIF was owned and controlled by Vinod Adani through EIH  the holding company of EIF  and that he was also a shareholder in Adani Enterprises Ltd  which in turn owned and controlled APML and APRL through its subsidiary Adani Power LimitedThe show cause notice also alleged that APML APRL Electrogen Infra FZE EIF and other respondents conspired to siphon off foreign exchange abroad for the benefit of their related entitiesThe notice called upon the respondents to show cause as to why the declared value in respect of the goods imported by APML and APRL should not be rejected under Rule 12 of the Customs Valuation Determination of Value of Imported Goods Rules 2007According to the DRI s case in the guise of import of power sector machinery and equipment APML and APRL the two entities of Adani Enterprises Limited appear to have indulged in overvaluation of impugned imported goods The actual value of the imported goods is Rs 318761 crore whereas the same have been invoiced at Rs 716173 crore thus leading to an overvaluation Rs 397412 crore which appears to have been siphoned off abroad through EIF an intermediary at UAE which is controlled and managed by Vinod Adani one of the promoters of Adani Enterprises Limited flagship company of the Adani Group The Adani Group has repeatedly denied that Vinod Adani is a promoter of the groupHowever the tribunal observed that when documents are not admissible in evidence the department cannot seek redetermination of value on the basis of these documents,The department has also sent a proposal to CBIC

a particularly dramatic eventor series of eventsto take over the news cycle the week the Union Budget is presented The Adani imbroglio did just that While the Budget and to an extent Economic Survey did make a valiant attempt at taking over headlines theirs was a shortlived time at the top As soon as the immediate analysis was done media houses across India quickly returned to the sensational ongoing topple of the erstwhile thirdrichest man in the world Gautam Adani And that is why Adani Enterprises and the continuing assault on it is ThePrint s Newsmaker of the Week 413 pages of drama The week started with a bang On 29 January Adani Group released a 413page response to the various allegations made against it by Hindenburg Research a United Statesbased short selling firm Adani came out with all guns blazing In its reply the group claimed to have answered all of the 88 questions Hindenburg posed in its original report that was released on 24 January Perhaps Adani Group also felt it could take advantage of the Rightwing social media cohort rallying around it The company claimed that Hindenburg s report was a calculated attack on India and also the independence integrity and quality of Indian institutions The fightback didn t stop there Adani Group went on to take aim at Hindenburg itself saying it has not published this report for any altruistic reasons but purely out of selfish motives and in flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws  Also read How Gautam Adani is helping Modi govt with India s foreign policy challenges Hindenburg s scathing reply to Adani Hindenburg was quick to respond publishing its reply to Adani Group on the morning of 30 January Right off the bat Hindenburg took on Adani Group s claims which equated an attack on itself to an attack on India To be clear we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future Hindenburg said adding that they also believe India s future is being held back by Adani Group which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation We also believe that fraud is fraud even when it s perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world Hindenburg added in its reply Clearly this David was not going to take Goliath s attacks lying down The short seller went on to say that in terms of substance Adani s 413page response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to our report Indeed it is worth noting that in Adani s lengthy response the annexurescontaining background information on past court cases and judgmentsbegan on page 55 Hindenburg pointed out that although Adani Group claimed to have answered all of its questions it had sidestepped the critical issue of Gautam Adani s elder brother Vinod Adani his alleged front companies and their alleged dealings with the Adani Group firms In what has come to become the hallmark of Hindenburg s brutal style it said In other words we are expected to believe that Gautam Adani has no idea why his brother Vinod lent massive sums of money to Adani entities and no idea where the money originated from If any of that were true Gautam could have easily cleared up the mystery by calling his brother Hindenburg further asked in its scathing reply Or asking him Vinod Adani at the next family dinner why he has been directing billions of dollars to Adanicontrolled entities through a network of opaque offshore shell entities it added Also read How to survive a bear attack  lessons for Adani in Ambani s stock market victory in 1980s Beginning of turmoil This was just Monday morning the week was just beginning Throughout Monday and Tuesday Adani Group managed to rally a fightback against the bears in the stock market with the Adani Enterprises stock ending both days marginally higher This recovery must have brought considerable relief for Gautam Adani coming as it did after a wipeout of about Rs 417 lakh crore of value from Adani stocks the previous week This relief however was shortlived On WednesdayBudget day incidentallynews emerged that Credit Suisse Group AG a Swiss investment banking firm had stopped accepting Adani Group bonds as collateral for margin loans given to its private banking clients While it didn t come right out to say it this basically meant Credit Suisse no longer trusted the value of the bonds issued by Adani companies This move was followed by more international buzz on the issue Media houses claimed that there were indications that the Adani Group had allegedly used various shady channels to invest funds in its own followon public offer FPO another potential sign of weakness and malfeasance What followed was the savage destruction of market value for Adani stocks The Adani Enterprises stock ended the day s trading session with a massive 2845 per cent down Then came the big and surprising news Late Wednesday night Adani Enterprises announced they were cancelling their Rs 20000 crore FPOthe biggest that India had seento protect investors  This announcement was unprecedented and embarrassing and it s probably not a coincidence that Adani released it at night long after the stock markets had closed and after most news agencies had wound down for the day Take a breath and drink some water that was just Wednesday If a rising tide lifts all boats a tsunami drowns them all Those who could bail out did On Thursday news came in that Jo Johnson brother of former United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson had resigned as director on the board of Elara Capital a UKbased company linked to the Adani Group and one that featured prominently in Hindenburg s original report The same day Citigroup s wealth arm said that from 7 February onwards it would also stop accepting securities of Adani companies as collateral for margin loans The blows didn t stop there The National Stock Exchange on Thursday announced that it was placing shares of Adani Enterprises Adani Ports and Ambuja Cements an Adani company under additional surveillance Internationally the SP Dow Jones Indices said it would be removing Adani Enterprises from its sustainability indices following a media

not,https://theprint.in/national-interest/market-has-won-now-its-for-adani-to-decide-whether-he-will-lose-or-not/1353029/,This weeks National Interest isnt about Gautam Adani This is instead about Indian capitalism This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in,2023-02-04 02:45:14+00:00,Market has won  now it s for Adani to decide whether he will lose or not,This week s National Interest isn t about Gautam Adani This is instead about Indian capitalism This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in our independent history Or more precisely post1991 history Since the expansion opening up and modernisation of Indian markets began in the summer of 1991 many crises have struck it periodically Among these were Harshad Mehta Ketan Parekh Fairgrowth and others Each one held out a crippling threat to Indian markets and to the new equity culture among common Indians which is so crucial to a new capitalism Each rocked Parliament pauperised many wellmeaning investors and sent some crooks to jail if briefly But there are five crucial differences between these and now  None of these crises arose when the Indian markets and economy were globally integrated  These were crises of domestic markets where domestic interventions either by financial or regulatory institutions  or even a phone call from North Block  could make a difference The latest one is playing out fully in global markets and more importantly international media  The old crises  check out the socalled KP7 KP for Ketan Parekh for example  mostly concerned Indian companies doing the bulk of their business in India This one is about India s most globalised corporate  The earlier crises emerged here and the whistleblowers or investigative journalists who exposed these were Indian This one has been triggered by a very foreign and tiny financial institution  The fifth and the most significant difference from the standpoint of this column  is that those who ve created this kerfuffle aren t whistleblowers Nor are they activist shareholders They are coming at it purely for profit They are shortsellers They have a fully disclosed vested interest in bringing down the share price of a company they re investing in by shortselling its UStraded bonds and nonIndiantraded derivative instruments Who said you only make money in the stock markets when your share goes up Also Read Prannoy and Radhika Roy and the world of news this week on The reason we list this fifth difference as the most critical is simple When foreigners invest in our companies when our companies list overseas when the world sings our praises when FDI and FPI figures zoom we celebrate Do we at the same time have the nerve to take the downsides that come with it One that we our government financial institutions or regulators can no longer influence or armtwist this allpowerful entity called the market  Two the need to accept that even what looks like a bunch of young upstarts can look to make mega profits by taking down one of your biggest conglomerates in the market Markets in good capitalism have no nationalist lens If money has no colour it also carries no passport And those who play in the market love their money first All national political or ideological loyalties come after that It is for all these reasons that we call the ongoing crisis the greatest stress test for Indian capitalism yet And as we conclude the first full week of the market action on this we can acknowledge that so far Indian capitalism has passed that test In fact with a score of almost 10 out of 10 Surprised Almost two weeks into the crisis the Modi government hasn t said a word about it None of the regulatory institutions has intervened in the market in any manner whatsoever least of all as if to help the Adani Group absorb the blow better The conglomerate has been left to its own devices If at all the NSE has done the usual  and prudent  thing of increasing margin payments to curb excessive speculation This is fully the NSE s mandate in a situation of heavy volatility While the conglomerate called it a foreign conspiracy to attack and damage India and its institutions the government the entire finance ministry establishment regulators and the ruling party leadership have all kept mum Never mind the flag If India s most powerful political establishment in almost five decades responds to a situation like this as if it s something that must only play out between a corporate and the market it is the coming of age of Indian capitalism It is as if let the market take its course is the new let the law take its own course  Think on the contrary what would have followed if the mighty Indian state had acted in the way it might have when our political economy was less evolved Really bad ideas like the suspension of trading and the launch of investigations against the greed amoral and whathaveyou shortsellers could ve found currency Even the whiff of such a false step would ve done enormous damage to India s markets the global trust on which a booming new economy rides and indeed to our still very adolescent capitalism And please don t say this talk is nonsense that no such thing would ever be possible The scar of the retrospective Vodafone amendment on global trust in India is still to heal fully We have to be grateful that such ideas aren t floating around now Also Read How retrospective restraint prevents Pranab Mukherjee from saying he was a winner or loser Essential to the embrace of capitalism is the acceptance of the fact that losses are as much a part of business as profits Nobody can pass a law mandating only profits in the markets That s why mutual fund sellers keep repeating that statutory warning Mutual fundequity investments are subject to market risks It s also because these investments involve risk that governments tax capital gains on equities and equity mutual funds at lowerthannormal rates The lesson for common folk therefore is not to get irritated when that statutory caution is repeated in so many advertisements between overs during your T20 live telecast Losses are as much a part of the market as profits Hindenburg has only underlined to us that you can also make profits from losses if you re a shortseller with nerve  and information The reason the market particularly one as large and spread out as India s is so powerful is that it can never be identified with any individual Not one not many not even a cohort Think of it as a mob of anonymous moneyed millions There is safety in numbers Which is further fortified by that oneline ideology that governs the market I love my money People can follow this god or that vote for one party and detest another love one football or IPL franchise and hate another But they will never let any of this affect their choices on the market The only thing that matters here is my money  Of course I can make the wrong choices but never because of my politics religion or loyalties This is what makes money the most secular god of all Which in turn makes the market the most powerful monarch At least in the world of capitalism If you are in the market  never mind whether as a corporate conglomerate broker banker or even an ordinary day trader or investor  understand the fundamental law that applies May you be ever so high the market is above you In this round the market has won But it is still for Adani now to decide whether he has lost or not Accepting defeat would mean continuing to fret and fight with the market with money or other clout finding shelter underneath the supposedly ulterior motives of the shortseller The other way would be to take the blow with humility as a bad day in the market Focus on the many good and bounteously cashyielding businesses and assets more sharply rebuild what just got broken and hope that the market will love you again in the course of time This would be good capitalism Also Read If Modi wants a real legacy he must undo Indira Gandhi s disastrous bank nationalisation,This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in our independent historySince the expansion opening up and modernisation of Indian markets began in the summer of 1991 many crises have struck it periodicallyBut there are five crucial differences between these and now None of these crises arose when the Indian markets and economy were globally integratedAnd

securities outside India has highlighted the limitations of the practice in the nation and,None,It s tough to short Adani stocks listed in India Here s why,Bloomberg ET CONTRIBUTORS Bloomberg Hindenburg Research s decision to only go short on Adani Group securities outside India has highlighted the limitations of the practice in the nation and the peculiarities of the business empire itselfIndia s authorities have imposed a bevy of restrictions on short selling including requiring institutional investors to disclose planned trades to the stock exchange before they are executed and making their retail counterparts close positions each day They also enforce the globallyfavored ban on naked shorts the practice where investors sell shares they haven t borrowed firstShorting the Adani Group also comes with its particular difficulties The Indianlisted entities all have a relatively low free float and few institutional investors which means there is a scarcity of shares for short sellers to borrow and they are therefore more expensive Founders and controlling shareholders hold at least 60 in nine of the 10 stocks data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence showThe fact that there was little short selling of Adani shares meant there was hardly any short covering that would normally limit a stock s downside The delicious irony is that shares of Adani companies are tanking hard or limit down partly because India makes it so hard to short in the first place shortselling specialist Scorpion Capital Partners said last week in a tweet There was no one to step in on the other side it saidHindenburg made clear in the disclosure to its report that its positions were all offshore The shorts on the Adani Group s companies were held through UStraded bonds and nonIndian traded derivatives along with other nonIndiantraded reference securities it said The short seller declined to comment on its decision to use offshore instruments when contacted by BloombergTheoretically the potential gains are enormous A trader who sold 1 million Adani Enterprises Ltd  shares at the open on Feb 1 and bought them back at the end of the same day after the record 28 plunge would have made about 280000 excluding fees and transaction costs according to Bloomberg calculationsShorting Adani Group shares is far more costly than betting against some of its Indian peersBorrowing stock of Adani Enterprises cost traders 8 rupees 10 US cents each on Jan 16 the latest available figure according to data compiled by Bloomberg That compares with a January average of 022 rupee for shares in Reliance Industries Ltd  India s largest stock by market valueBut even for other stocks the market for borrowing and lending in India remains tiny according to Kamal Visaria founder trustee at Visaria Family Trust in MumbaiIndia s stocklendingandborrowing segment hasn t matured at the rate at which it was expected to and is still very small relative to similar mechanisms in more developed markets he saidIn the US shares borrowed amounted to about 42 of float across the market at the end of last quarter according to S3 Partners a provider of financial data In contrast volumes in India s 32 trillion cash equities market are negligible and the derivatives segment is more liquid and typically used by traders Visaria saidGiven that shorting Adani stock in India can be problematic short sellers may prefer to use derivativesAn Indiabased investor can either buy put options sell calls sell futures or create a multileg options strategy that benefits from a fall in shares of four of the Adani group stocks listed in India namely Adani Enterprises Ambuja Cements Ltd  ACC Ltd  and Adani Ports  Special Economic Zone LtdVolumes for options linked to Adani stocks have surged amid the volatility Open interest on such contracts linked to Adani Enterprises  or positions yet to be settled  climbed to a record last weekEven to do this though global investors need a Foreign Portfolio Investor license to be able to trade onshore derivatives which can be difficult to obtain despite the regulator easing rules in 2019 It s a very laborious process said Soren Aandahl founder of shortselling firm Blue Orca Capital LLC who is known for his bets against Hong Konglisted companies It s very difficult to get that license approval from a regulator Alternatively there are offshore derivatives traded in Singapore and Dubai but liquidity in those instruments can be extremely thin About 216800 lots of Adani Ports  Special Economic Zone s contracts for February delivery were traded via the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd by late Friday compared with just 90 in Singapore There s a lot of hurdles to trading that market Aandahl said of India And unfortunately with India the ones that you can trade through the offshore futures exchanges they tend to be just much bigger companies but even so the liquidity is not that fantastic With assistance from P R Sanjai and

is one of the largest private sector airport operators the secondlargest operator of coal mines after CIL Coal India Ltd it has mines in Indonesia,None,Adani row Journalist mentioned in Hindenburg report speaks up,Paranjoy Guha Thakurta breaks his silence twoandahalf years after a court in Ahmedabad issued a gag order asking him not to speak or write anything that may go against the interests of Adani Group Guha Thakurta said he was not willing to hazard a guess on the future of the Adani conglomerate He said his response to the questions posed by The Telegraph only stated facts Paranjoy Guha Thakurta the journalist who found prominent mention in the Hindenburg Research report that triggered turmoil in the share prices of the Adani Group and cast international glare on Indian probity in corporate governance breaks his silence twoandahalf years after a court in Ahmedabad issued a gag order asking him not to speak or write anything that may go against the interests of the Adani Group I do not want to commit contempt of court I have only given you facts Guha Thakurta told this newspaper on Sunday Excerpts from the conversation follow Q What piqued your interest in the Adani conglomerate Guha Thakurta I started writing about the Adani Group because I write about the corporate sector the economy  my area of interest as a journalist is political economy  I have been a journalist for 45 years and I am now 67 years old The rise of the Adani Group has been truly spectacular Very few people had heard about the Adani Group even 20 years ago Until 10 days ago he was the world s third richest man Asia s richest man Now he s fallen off from that perch after the shares of his listed companies crashed So if the rise of the Adani Group has been spectacular the fall has been even more spectacular Very few of us including myself could ever have imagined before the Hindenburg Research report came out on January 24 that the Adani Group would not continue to rise Q What sets the Adani Group apart from many other Indian corporates Guha Thakurta What is truly out of the ordinary is the manner in which the Adani Group exercises dominance over so many sectors and segments of the Indian economy It is the largest commercial port operator in India It operates a dozen ports along the west and east coast of India Internationally it has the Haifa Port in Israel and Abbot Point in Australia Adani is one of the largest private sector airport operators the secondlargest operator of coal mines after CIL Coal India Ltd it has mines in Indonesia and in Australia It is the single biggest importer of coal to India the secondlargest generator of electricity from coal after NTPC The Adani Group also used to be the biggest aggregator of cut and polished diamonds 15 years ago  it divested this interest to others including Winsome Diamonds of Jatin Mehta who is the fatherinlaw of Vinod Adani s daughter Vinod is Gautam Adani s brother Jatin Mehta is currently outside the country Winsome Diamonds happens to be one of the largest nonperforming assets Q When did you first write about the Adani Group Guha Thakurta My article in 2015 was by and large a compilation of materials that were already in the public domain The first article that one may call exclusive appeared in April 2016 by when I was the editor of the Economic and Political Weekly EPW I wrote several articles in the EPW including on allegations of misuse of benefits by the cutandpolished diamond business of the group about the pricing of power The last article I wrote for the EPW in June 2017 pertained to the changes in the rules concerning power projects in SEZs special economic zones It also talked about how the government  the ministry of finance and the ministry of commerce  were processing an application for a refund of customs duties in excess of Rs 500 crore without first checking whether the duty had been paid The matter reached Parliament Q You stepped down from the EPW shortly after this Guha Thakurta As you know I resigned in July 2017 after the board of trustees of the EPW said I should not be writing articles in my name because that s what my predecessors had done I was told they were thinking of appointing a coeditor that I had destroyed the ethos of a prestigious publication which is like an institution I was told that I had done an act of grave impropriety by engaging the service of a lawyer pro bono to respond to a legal notice that was served to the publisher printer writer and the editor of the article And finally I was told to take the article down and not to leave the room until the article was pulled down I called a colleague of mine pulled down the article got hold of a piece of paper and wrote out my resignation Q But you continued to write on the Adani Group Guha Thakurta The article taken down by the EPW was published by The Wire the news portal Several people came out in my support including Professor Amartya Sen and renowned scholar Noam Chomsky Afterwards my articles on the Adani Group by and large appeared in other publications notably NewsClick I became a consultant with NewsClick in May 2018 Q Isn t there a gag order against you Guha Thakurta I am the only citizen of India against whom lawyers representing companies headed by Gautam Adani have instituted six defamation cases that are currently pending in the courts of law Two of the cases are before the first class judicial magistrate at Mundra in Gujarat two in courts of Ahmedabad Gujarat one in Baran district in Rajasthan and one in Delhi In September 2020 the courts in Ahmedabad issued a gag order on me my coauthor Abir Dasgupta and NewsClick headed by Prabir Purakayastha that we cannot speak say or write anything that goes against the interests of Gautam Adani and his conglomerate There was an article which was considered to be defamatory  the contents of the article were not challenged The headline was deemed to be defamatory It was the last of the series of three articles The allegation against me my colleagues and NewsClick was that we have lowered the esteem of the judiciary in the eyes of the public The case is currently pending and I cannot say anything more on this Recently in the Rajasthan case several of us appeared before the magistrate at the Grameen Nayalay in Baran district to provide bail bonds and sureties for the bail bonds The article which was pulled down by the EPW was challenged by the Adani Group saying it was defamatory Cases were moved against the entities that run The Wire my coauthors and myself It went to a civil court in Bhuj and to a criminal court in Mundra But now both are in Mundra Q Was there any attempt to arrest you as mentioned in the Hindenburg report Were you jailed Guha Thakurta In January 2021 while the pandemic was on a nonbailable warrant of arrest was issued against me by a firstclass judicial magistrate in Mundra My lawyer argued that this nonbailable warrant was bad in law He referred to the judgments of the Supreme Court where it was written that if a person fails to appear in court you can issue a bailable warrant If that person still does not appear the court can issue a nonbailable warrant This case relates to the article pulled down from the EPW and published by The Wire later In May 2019 before the results of the Lok Sabha elections were announced the Adani Group withdrew the cases against everybody  The Wire my three coauthors but I am the only person against whom the case continues To answer your question I was never arrested Q Did you collaborate with Hindenburg Research Guha Thakurta I never heard of it before the report came out However the report which consists of 32000 words if printed as a book can run into 150 pages It makes several references to the work done by me and independent journalists like Abir Dasgupta who I collaborated with But they must have accessed the materials which are in the public domain Q Do you feel vindicated today after the Hindenburg Research report came out Guha Thakurta Yes I do Q Have you met Gautam Adani Guha Thakurta I met Gautam Adani on two occasions  May 2017 in Mumbai and then in February 2021 I had a long telephone conversation with him very recently But on each of these occasions I met him on conditions that it would be off the record I did not record those conversations During each of the conversations except for the telephone call there were people with me A former colleague was with me in 2017 and in 2021 there were five of us in the room including Gautam Adani and my wife The first meeting lasted for about an hour while the second one lasted one hour and 55 minutes to be precise The phone call lasted about 15 minutes Q Did you initiate the interaction Guha Thakurta The first meeting took place at my behest The second one was by my lawyer Anand Yagnik who arranged it with the expectation that an outofcourt settlement could be arrived at But that did not happen The last phone call was a request from me to withdraw the cases Q What was his response Guha Thakurta He was noncommittal The cases are still pending as we speak Q Since you have written a number of articles against top companies and conglomerates have you faced court cases before Guha Thakurta Many corporates have sent legal notices but nobody has actually taken me to court Legal notices were sent by lawyers representing corporate entities headed by both the Ambani brothers Subrata Roy of Sahara never took me to court either Q These cases must have taken a toll on you Guha Thakurta Yes these cases do have an impact on me and my life Takes up time and involves expenditure But if you ask me if I would have done anything differently I would say no ,Very few people had heard about the Adani Group even 20 years agoSo if the rise of the Adani Group has been spectacular the fall has been even more spectacularVery few of us including myself could ever have imagined before the Hindenburg Research report came out on January 24 that the Adani Group would not continue to riseQ What sets the Adani Group apart from many other Indian corporatesQ Since you have written a number of articles against top companies and conglomerates have you faced court cases before,Not Available,"['hindenburg', 'gautam', 'adani', 'article', 'mentioned', 'report', 'row', 'group',

financial stability were at risk Also read Adani Ports considering Rs 5000cr debt repayment by March 2024 Karan Adani Speaking in the Lok Sabha Motira said an investigation by the market regulator Sebi was ongoing but Adani Group put out a statement saying it had been exonerated by the highest court of the land Which court Which nation she asked The parliamentarian further said that Gautam

transactions Also read Fitch Moodys say Adani crisis unlikely to pose credit risk for Indian banks Why has Sebi been the silent operator Why would they permit a Rs 20000 crore FPO without submitting

How Moitra asked while firing a barrage of questions at the government What about the DRI what about customs What about GST What are they doing This is the deception of the highest order the TMC MP

outstanding loan of Rs 27000 crore Why were they again anchor investors in FPO she asked Last month Adani Group launched Rs 20000 crore FPO Followon Public Offer For the first few days the response was tepid due to the adverse report by Hindenburg and the subsequent stock plunge However the issue was subscribed fully by the closing day The next day markets crashed further wiping off significant money of new investors in just a day Rocked by the market volatility the conglomerate called off the FPO saying it would not be morally correct to go ahead with it Today Moitra alleged that the

disprove and discredit the report The fact that they failed to only reaffirms,2023-02-08 05:13:24+00:00,Hindenburg showed skin in the game with report on Adani It can t be dismissed as suspect ,Nearly 4000 years ago King Hammurabi of Babylon established Law 229 which said that if a builder builds a house and it collapses causing the death of the resident then the builder shall also be put to death Hammurabi posted his set of laws in a public square for every literate person to read and believed this law was necessary to ensure highquality construction in his empire Author Nassim Nicholas Taleb cites this nugget of history to explain his philosophy of skin in the game  an ethical principle of symmetric incentives It is a seemingly simple but intuitively hardtograsp idea of an equal share of risks and rewards for all stakeholders in a transaction The ongoing Hindenburg  Adani saga can be viewed through this prism to explain some of the confusion and scepticism ascribed to Hindenburg s motives Hindenburg Research a USbased shortseller published a voluminous research report that cast severe aspersions on the Adani Group s operations and claimed in a shrill manner that Adani was the biggest con in corporate history But they didn t stop there they also revealed that they had placed a big bet against the shares of Adani Group and stand to gain if the shares drop in value And the implied corollary that they would lose all their money if they were proven wrong and the shares did not fall In essence Hindenburg put their money where their keyboard was Senior political leaders public commentators and even economics professors in ivy league universities have questioned Hindenburg s motives and argued that the report is just a facade to drive the price down and gain profits They argue that Hindenburg published a fallacious and exaggerated report because the short seller made a bet against Adani shares and is not indulging in some act of investor protection So was Hindenburg s revelation of its ability to profit from the report a case of skin in the game or skewed motive Also read Gautam Adani news overshadowed even the Budget The saga has just begun How Hindenburg shook Adani Let us suppose that a pure research entity or a media publication released the exact same findings Their veracity would have still been questioned and perhaps dismissed even more quickly as a vested shootandscoot operation because these were mere agencies with nothing to lose but something to gain from the report In fact there have been several reports by research shops or media stories in the past that have highlighted some of the very same issues that Hindenburg has raised about the Adani group Those were waved away nonchalantly either through intimidation with the threat of a lawsuit or labelling them as easily motivated operations Hindenburg s transparent disclosure that it stands to gain financially if its report was taken seriously or lose if it wasn t created symmetric incentives that established the credibility of the report It was a signal to the market that they believed so strongly in the quality of their research that other Adani shareholders would be convinced to sell their positions and hence the stock price would fall In Talebian terms Hindenburg had skin in the game in this transaction Hindenburg could have chosen one of many options in this case 1 Publish a report without betting against the share price 2 Bet against the share price without publishing a report 3 Publish a report take a bet but do not disclose their short bet against Adani shares 4 Publish the report bet against the shares and be transparent Options three and four satisfy the skin in the game condition but option four also signals to the rest of the market about Hindenburg s skin in the game  which was the option it chose Also read How to survive a bear attack  lessons for Adani in Ambani s stock market victory in 1980s Hindenburg s report not suspect To be sure I am not for a moment arguing that markets are perfect and cannot be manipulated by mischievous reports If any I believe markets are more often imperfect than perfect But to argue that Hindenburg s motive is suspect because it stood to profit misses the entire notion of symmetric incentives because it also stood to lose its money if the market did not believe its report Adani Group had the opportunity to disprove and discredit the report and cause a lot of financial ruin to Hindenburg The fact that they failed to only reaffirms the veracity of Hindenburg s findings at least before the market It is common practice in the world of finance for investors to buy shares of a certain company and subsequently talk up that company in public to let the world know so that they can benefit from a rise in its share price This is an accepted norm and it is left to the markets to either believe or disbelieve the greatness of that company No one questions the motives behind this established practice But even erudite people seem to struggle to accept the flip side of the same practiceto talk down a company in public and bet against its shares The idea that one can profit from a fall in the share price seems to be far more challenging to comprehend and accept for most people than the idea of profiting from a rise in the share price This asymmetry of the human mind has been researched and documented in great detail by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman and Israeli mathematical psychologist Amos Tversky who called it loss aversion  Ethical philosophers may justifiably argue that it is worse to profit from someone else s misfortune than from their fortune hence the two cannot be equated But that is beyond the scope of this discussion Betting against a share or short sell establishes symmetric incentives that are more credible It is nave and fallacious to argue that a short sale induces perverse incentives but a long sale does not The fact that Hindenburg could lose money if its report was wrong or rebutted easily was actually the biggest signal of its credibility Arguably the exacerbated problem of fake news in the modern world is at its core a problem of asymmetric incentives where there is no punishment but ample reward and encouragement for false reportage in the guise of free speech Establishing symmetric incentives like in the Hindenburg example can be a solution to stem the fake news malaise in society But in this specific case Hindenburg s skin in the game act removed Gautam Adani s skin metaphorically Praveen Chakravarty is a political

Adani Group run by billionaire Gautam Adani is turning into another bad milestone for environmental,2023-02-14 05:47:58+05:30,Hindenburg row Adani shock rips through ESG funds as strategy fails test,The crisis of Indias secondlargest conglomerate Adani Group run by billionaire Gautam Adani is turning into another bad milestone for environmental social and governance ESG Stocks bearing the Adani name appear in over 500 socalled Article 8 funds that are supposed to promote ESG goals provided that the companies in which the investments are made follow good governance practices under European Union rules according to data compiled by Bloomberg As many as 80 of those exposures are through direct holdings while the remaining are mostly through funds of funds or index trackers the data shows which correct for duplicate holdings As the Adani Group companies get stripped from indexes and are put under review amid allegations of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation ESG investors are once again left wondering why a strategy intended to shield against risks such as greenwashing and bad governance  often at an extra fee  didn t protect them from the latest meltdown What are ESG funds ESG funds are investments which make investment commitment based on environmental social and governance factors A firm that makes investments in an ESG fund should be wellrun and also have a positive impact on the environment and society as well Also ESG funds seeks to benefit society and the environment while also producing financial returns ESG analysts believe that the strong headwinds faced by the Adani Group could impact access to offshore ESGlinked financing plans of other Indian firms An individual who tracks ESG investments has termed the Adani crisis as a bad omen for India s green energy ambitions In the wake of a late January report by USbased short seller Hindenburg Research the selloff in the Adani Groups seven listed subsidiaries have cumulatively lost about 120 billion in group market value in the last three weeks Funds with nearly 10 billion in assets under management tracking MSCI ESG indexes held shares in Adani Enterprises Ltd alone as per an analysis by the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute The institute has been studying the Adani Group since mid2020 In a report on Adani published on 9 February Ulf Erlandsson AFII s chief executive officer and Stephanie Mielnik its head of fixedincome research wrote Our view is that ESG investors with this unfortunate exposure should engage with their managers and potentially regulatory bodies that are better positioned to examine why this indexfund inclusion has occurred Patrick Wood Uribe the CEO of Util an ESG research firm backed by private equity and venture capital investors said the Adani debacle exposes some fundamental flaws in the approach adopted by several ESG index and ratings providers as well as portfolio managers There can be a very large mismatch with what investors are expecting when they place their money in a company or a fund classified as ESG Wood Uribe said in an interview And by offering an overly simplified view ESG ratings end up doing a disservice to investors he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg 27 of Article 8 funds meet its sustainability requirement In an effort to address such concerns the European Securities and Markets Authority has proposed enforcing minimum thresholds that would require Article 8 managers to apply stricter standards to their ESG claims A recent analysis by Morningstar Inc found that if the ESMA proposal is adopted only 27 of Article 8 funds would actually meet its sustainability requirement Adani companies were also held by 11 funds registered as Article 9 which is the EU s highest ESG classification Eight of these were through direct holdings according to an analysis by Bloomberg In order to justify an Article 9 designation under EU rules a fund manager needs to prove that a portfolio is 100 sustainable with allowances made for hedging and liquidity needs ESG fund managers are under increasing pressure to be much clearer with investors about what exactly they are offering and what it means Util s Wood Uribe said There remains a massive opportunity and a massive gap in actually meeting some of those sustainability objectives actually delivering on what investors would like to see in terms of sustainable investment Util also notes that Adani stock documents were replete with the kind of ESG verbiage that portfolio managers often look for In its rebuttal of the Hindenburg report Adani frequently cited the group s adherence to ESG principles and pointed to its adoption of multiple global ESG frameworks including the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures TCFD and Sustainable Development Goals SDGs among others Adani has denied all allegations calling them malicious baseless and a calculated attack on India It called Hindenburg the Madoffs of Manhattan referring to the late financier and fraudster Bernie Madoff ESG ratings firms meanwhile have given some corners of the Adani Group conspicuously high scores Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Total Gas Ltd still carry an A rating at MSCI Inc according to data on the website of MSCI Adani Transmission Ltd is rated BBB All three have lost more than a third of their value since the Hindenburg report was published A spokesperson for MSCI said the firm is due to conduct a review of its ESG and climate indexes which may include changes as early as this week This is a conglomerate with operations in commodities utilities gas and airports and one that is engaged in some of the most controversial coal mining projects in recent history including the largest openpit coal mining operation Wood Uribe said in a written analysis of the Adani group Thanks to the convoluted structures and multiplicity of subsidiaries cited in the Hindenburg report Adani has long been able to finance its dirtier operations with the proceeds of sustainable fund flows he said Asia ESG funds global market share doubles Meanwhile in Asia ESG funds have doubled their international market share

philanthropist George Soros believes the turmoil at Gautam Adanis business empire may weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modis hold on the government,None,What did George Soros says about PM Modi over Adani issue,PTI New Delhi February 17 Billionaire philanthropist George Soros believes the turmoil at Gautam Adanis business empire may weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modis hold on the government  a statement which was strongly countered by BJP as an attack on Indian democracy Adani group has been under severe pressure since the US shortseller Hindenburg Research on January 24 accused it of accounting fraud and stock manipulation allegations that the conglomerate has denied as malicious baseless and a calculated attack on India While listed companies of the group lost over USD 125 billion in market value in three weeks opposition parties inside and outside Parliament attacked the BJP government for the meteoric rise of the portstoenergy conglomerate Stocks of most group firms have risen in the last couple of days Soros in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Thursday said Modi would have to answer questions from foreign investors and Parliament on allegations the Adani group is facing His speech drew sharp reactions Ruling BJP said Soros was not only targeting the Prime Minister but also the Indian democratic system This war is being mounted against India and what stands between the war and Indias interests is Modi BJP leader and Union minister Smriti Irani told reporters Everyone should condemn his remarks in one voice Soros in his speech said the turmoil at Adani may open the door to a democratic revival in the country His near 42minute speech oscillated between climate change RussiaUkraine war rumbling in the US Turkey disaster and failures in China Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies their fate is intertwined he claimed Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards Modi is silent on the subject but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in Parliament He did not offer any evidence for his claim This will significantly weaken Modis stranglehold on Indias federal government and open the door to push for much needed institutional reforms he said I may be nave but I expect a democratic revival in India His comments drew sharp reaction from the ruling establishment Kanchan Gupta senior adviser to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said the faces behind repeated regime change stands exposed Face behind repeated regime change attempts in India with collaborators paid by The Open Society Foundations stands exposed Indias enemies are many George Soros leads the pack Democracy in India is strong resilient 2024 is not too far away and Soros will eat crow again he tweeted attaching news of Soros comments Gupta went on to state that the Munich Security Conference MSS was a platform for discussing global security challenges and seeking paths to peace and stability not conflict Soros being given a platform to share his subversive regime change agenda to undermine India tells a different story about MSS he said The 92yearold investor started his speech at the conference talking of understanding the current state of affairs and finding a way to distinguish what is important from what is less so Let me start with a bold assertion While two systems of governance are engaged in a fight for global domination our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change This is a very succinct statement but I believe it provides an accurate summary of the current state of affairs he said devoting a good deal of his speech on climate change He then stated that as the founder of Open Society Foundation he considers open societies morally superior to closed ones At this point he talks of repressive states and distinguishes between open and closed societies India is an interesting case Its a democracy but its leader Narendra Modi is no democrat he claimed Modi he said maintains close relations with both open and closed societies India is a member of the Quad which also includes Australia the US and Japan but it buys a lot of Russian oil at a steep discount and makes a lot of money on it he said before turning to Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey Erdogan has much in common with Modi he said But while Modi seemed to be firmly in the saddle until recently Erdogan has mismanaged the Turkish economy and will face elections in May All his efforts are focused on winning the elections Soros thereafter talked about how Erdogan was autocratic his attempts to jail opponents and the governments slow response to the massive earthquake in Turkey He then made the comments on Modi and his links with Adani before moving on to other countries like Brazil Russia and its conflict with Ukraine US president Joe Bidens role in the war and finally to China Turning to China Xi Jinping would be an obvious loser His close association with Putin would hurt him But China may be already undergoing a revolution he said adding Xis Zero Covid policy was his biggest blunder After devoting time on talking about what ails China he turned to the US saying democracy isnt functioning very well When Donald Trump became president in 2016 he posed a real threat to our democracy he claimed Trump is a deeply flawed character a confidence trickster whose narcissism grew into a disease He hoped that in 2024 Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida would slug it out for the Republican nomination To conclude I want to repeat what I said at the beginning while open and closed societies are in a fight for global domination our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change I believe this sums up the current state of affairs accurately he added adani modi,Soros in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Thursday said Modi would have to answer questions from foreign

all allegations as baseless and discredited After hearing four public interest litigations PILs seeking a probe against,2023-02-17 23:40:22+05:30,Supreme Court seeks transparency on Adani expert panel,NEW DELHI  The Supreme Court on Friday declined to accept the Union government s suggestions on the scope and composition of an expert committee to examine all aspects of the AdaniHindenburg saga that were submitted in a sealed envelope and said it would appoint the committee on its own in the interests of transparency The release of shortseller Hindenburg Research s 24 January report accusing the Gautam Adani led conglomerate of corporate malfeasance sparked a crash in shares of Adani Group companies and created a political furore over the billionaire s alleged proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi The Adani Group has dismissed all allegations as baseless and discredited After hearing four public interest litigations PILs seeking a probe against Hindenburg for causing significant loss to investors on regulatory lapses and an investigation of the Adani Group on the basis of the Hindenburg report a bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud reserved orders on the remit and composition of the committee After examining a note submitted by solicitor general Tushar Mehta in a sealed cover the bench also comprising justices PS Narasimha and JB Pardiwala said If we have to accept these suggestions we must disclose it to the other side There has to be transparency and confidence in the process The government proposed a sixmember committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge comprising the Union home secretary and director Enforcement Directorate The note required the committee to submit a report in eight weeks with the initial report to be filed in sealed cover considering the volatile and emotion driven nature of the securities market However the government s note clarified that the constitution of the committee would not be a reflection on the ability or competence of the Securities Exchange Board of India Sebi or any other statutory body The bench said If it is in a sealed cover the petitioners will not know which names we accepted and which we have not and they will get to say it is a governmentappointed committee Following a course of action that it adopted in the past of choosing a committee of its own to examine the Pegasus spyware row where the phones of prominent individuals were allegedly placed under surveillance the bench said We d rather not accept the sealed cover suggestions in constituting a committee as we want to follow full transparency We will appoint a committee in which there will be more confidence The court did not wish to put those names in public domain either It will not be good for the individuals We will do it on our own The Centre s note also dealt with the proposed terms of reference for the committee with the primary task being to ascertain the truthfulness of allegations against the Adani Group of companies in the Hindenburg report The probe the note added would also focus on Hindenburg s admission of acquiring a short position in Adani group debt and derivatives gathering details of all its transactions undertaken prior to publication of report and assessing whether the transactions fall foul of the penal statutory and regulatory framework in India The remit of the committee the note said would also include suggestions to strengthen the regulatory framework for better protection of investors in future In

Singh of DLF,The turmoil engulfing Gautam Adanis business empire following damning allegations by a US short seller has not shaken the faith of global investors in India real estate doyen K P Singh said rubbishing suggestions that banks would have lent to Adani group on instructions from higherups The punishing stock market selloff Adani group companies have seen following the January 24 report of Hindenburg Research is a temporary blip concerning just one corporate group and hasnt harmed faith in India as an investment opportunity he told PTI in an interviewHe however felt the Adani group needs to beef up capital and cut down debt to continue to remain on the high growth trajectoryKnown for his plain speaking Singh cited how a Canadian firm had threatened to bring out a report when his retail estate firm DLF was bringing out an IPO oneandahalfdecade backWe said pushoff to the Canadian firm do whatever you can  he said adding there are blackmailers who bring out reports around any big share saleThe Hindenburg report that alleged accounting fraud and stock manipulation at the Adani group came just as a Rs 20000 crore followon share sale of the conglomerates flagship firm Adani Enterprises openedCompletely nonsense he said on the AdaniHindenburg row impacting Indias attractiveness as an investment destination India is too big a country today So this story will die down Investment will not be hurt Modi is a sensible and dynamic person and so long as he remains prime minister India will remain an attractive destination he saidThe applestoairport conglomerate has denied all allegations calling them malicious baseless and a calculated attack on IndiaThe Adani groups listed firm lost about USD 125 billion in market value in three weeks after the report Some recovery has been seen in the last couple of daysWhile the groups rapid expansion  from cement to hydrogen and data centres has largely been fuelled by debt funding Singh who is now chairman emeritus of DLF said suggestions that banks lent money to the Adani group because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi telling them to do so was rubbishWhat has the prime minister got to do with it lending money to a corporate No banker even if the prime minister tells anything will give money unless it is justified he saidI have no clues about Adani but if somebody thinks today that a call from the prime minister will make bankers give loan then they are living in a fools world No banker will do this thingCiting the example of former ICICI Bank chief executive Chanda Kochhar who was arrested on

attack the government alleging Modi aided the Adani groups riseThe Prime Minister has not referred to Adani by name since the crisis triggered by the Hindenburg report but earlier this month he told Parliament that the blessings of 140 crore people in the country are my protective cover and you cant destroy it with lies and abusesSingh said Modi need not respond and should continue to do his jobSo many dogs will bark he should not respond to it System will take care They will go away He should continue doing what he is doing he saidOn the troubles facing Adani group he said entrepreneurs are risk takers but its always smart to strike a balance between equity and debtAdanis rival Mukesh Ambani has done the smart thing of balancing debt by bringing in equity investors across businessesEvery businessman goes through this thing In your zest for growth you get debt But Balance debt with equity And grow again he said adding Adani was trying to do that through the FPO of Adani EnterprisesAdani group has maintained that its debt of Rs 196 lakh crore as on September 2022 was balanced with assets it has and the revenues all the businesses are generatingAlways have a healthy

this a favour Really The Sri Lanka terminal will cost 750 million and Haifa Port 118 billion No Indian rival would dare risk so much even if offered on a platter Adanis skills have made him a strategic player more than just a businessmanA port is no cosy monopoly It has to compete in logistics and pricing to woo ships from established rivals Mundras logistics have attracted business investments of thousands of crores creating an industrial hub in the desert It has the worlds largest automated coalhandling facility A 2017 Morgan Stanley report puts Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone APSEZ in the top 25 of global port companiesCritics focus on government favours to Adani In India business success requires good management of not only factories but politics too All businessmen cosy up to politicians But while this opens doors and overcomes some rules it cannot guarantee success Anil Ambani is often accused by Rahul Gandhi of getting 30000 crore in defence deals Yet he has flopped commerciallyOnce Dhirubhai Ambani was also accused of political manipulation and boondoggles He responded What have I done that every other businessman has not There was no reply Other businessmen many with formidable historical advantages had also wooed politicians and fiddled books For a newcomer like Dhirubhai to beat the old giants at their own game signified immense talent Something similar can be said of AdaniDhirubhais dubious acts are detailed in Hamish McDonalds 1998 book The Polyester Prince But critics are dead wrong to think that he was just a successful manipulator During the licencepermit raj manipulation was inescapable But once the economy was liberalised he built the worlds largest exportoriented oil refinery with operating margins higher than even Singapores famed refineries proving himself world class He got favours in telecom but created the cheapest telephone network in the world Those who focus only on his manipulation are blind to the phenomenal skills that made him a historical titan  warts and all Adani is treading a similar pathCritics say Adani deals mainly in infrastructure where cosiness to the government matters more than true skills No Dozens of new tycoons with strong regional political clout joined the infrastructure boom of 200308 But despite having political godfathers many ran into trouble and went bust leaving banks with enormous unpaid debts Success in infrastructure requires skill not just political friendsReaders may think I am a great Adani fan But I do not own any Adani company shares because of high prices and high risk Adani has been diversifying and expanding at breakneck speed using borrowed money bidding very high prices in auctions and acquisitions This facilitates fast expansion but carries great risks History has examples aplenty of business titans who diversified crazily to create giant conglomerates succeeded for a few decades amid applause but eventually came a cropper like General Electric under Jack WelchSo I think the Hindenburg report may be the best thing that ever happened to Adani It will slow his speed of expansion and diversification and force his financiers to be diligent and cautious in future This could impose highly desirable financial discipline on Adani to his own benefit Hindenburg may have been a blessing in disguise  or in Winston Churchills words in response to his wife trying to cheer him up after his postwar electoral defeat a blessing quite effectively disguisedOne day I might actually buy Adani shares,Swami Speaks Dhirubhai Ambani had beaten old school business boys Adani probably better at it The Hindenburg report may be the best thing that ever happened to billionaire Gautam Adani says Swaminathan AiyarI visited Gautam Adani s new Mundra port and was struck by its high automation and speedSo Mundra seemed to be on another planetThe Hindenburg Research report has alleged vast price rigging and fraud by Adani companiesA 2017

some selfdoubt as to how the campaign against Gautam Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would play out politically and electorally Will it,None,Adani Rafale Pegasus and the Question of What Concerns the Indian Voter,Last week a Congress spokesperson asked me whether the Adani issue would matter at all to the ordinary voter Clearly he had some selfdoubt as to how the campaign against Gautam Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would play out politically and electorally Will it affect Modi s popularity Sections of the Congress party may be grappling with this question especially after Rahul Gandhi upped the ante dramatically with his captivating speech in the Lok Sabha on the unique relationship between Gautam Adani and PM Modi A large part of the speech stands expunged showing that the issue is troubling Modi But Modi has also shown the capacity to repeatedly emerge politically unscathed and this causes selfdoubt in the opposition camp On an earlier occasion similar selfdoubts were expressed by sections of the Congress when Rahul Gandhi had relentlessly campaigned against Modi s handling of the Rafale deal Even then some opposition leaders felt that Modi was seen as personally incorruptible so simply attacking him with corruption charges would not help The same logic was used when the Pegasus issue exploded in parliament and a whole session was nearly washed out How will the Pegasus issue impact the voter in Uttar Pradesh Bihar or Rajasthan So the larger question is as follows  should the opposition choose issues for political campaigning based purely on how they would play out electorally and how much they would impact Modi s image If this is the dominant consideration for doing opposition politics then it would be severely selflimiting and even selfdefeating Politics cannot work on such a narrow and instrumental basis True Modi has a certain teflon quality something they used to say about Atal Bihari Vajpayee too Many corruption scams in Vajpayee s time did not stick to him personally But that did not dissuade the Opposition from campaigning on those issues Of course Vajpayee s government was less centralised which helped the Prime Minister s Office to deflect the blame to coalition partners It was then widely believed that Pramod Mahajan was the party s chief fund collector and Vajpayee s policy was to keep some distance from those activities But nothing is static in politics Vajpayee did lose power in spite of retaining much of his aura of personal incorruptibility So the opposition would do well not to get intimidated by what seems like Modi s impenetrable teflon image More importantly it is the opposition s dharma to campaign around issues without always weighing the outcome in terms of electoral dividends In politics outcomes generally don t build up in a linear fashion A lot of things accumulate in the electorate s deeper consciousness before manifesting all at once So every issue which rightfully deserves intense campaigning must be taken up irrespective of immediate electoral gains Rafale was a big issue because it was apparent that all established procedures for defence procurement sanctified by the cabinet and the President of India were upended overnight Corruption is not just about taking bribes It is also about how established institutions are deliberately weakened and destroyed On Modi s policy to actively help in the expansion of big business entities the issue is not whether he has personally benefited from his close links with such businesses It is more about how such a nexus with big business impacts democracy and key democratic institutions The opposition needs to properly nuance its messaging by suggesting that one need not be personally financially corrupt to perpetuate oneself in power by cornering over 85 of all big business funding in favour of one party The people who vote and care for India s democracy will eventually understand this logic It is therefore not all about whether a leader is amassing personal wealth or not It seems like a nobrainer that the campaign around Modi s nexus with big business has to be directly linked to the opaque manner in which electoral bonds are funding Indian politics Hopefully at some stage the voter will clearly understand what is at stake It would be meaningless for the opposition to sit back and speculate how quickly the voter might respond to such campaigns The opposition must do what is right It is as simple as that,Last week a Congress spokesperson asked me whether the Adani issue would matter at all to the ordinary voterHow will the Pegasus issue impact the voter in Uttar Pradesh Bihar or RajasthanIf this is the dominant consideration for doing opposition politics then it would be severely selflimiting and even selfdefeatingRafale was a big issue because it was apparent that all established procedures for defence procurement sanctified by the cabinet and the President of India

India Company had taken it away from India former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said while addressing his party s 85th plenary session on Sunday Warning that history is repeating itself  Mr Gandhi said that Modi ji and Adani ji are one and that was why the Opposition was not allowed to ask questions about business tycoon Gautam Adani in Parliament He then asserted that he would continue to ask question about Mr Adani until the truth came out The former Congress chief also urged the party leadership to formulate a new plan to carry forward the tapasya penance undertaken through the Bharat Jodo Yatra indicating that another yatra could be on the cards along the eastwest route this time Kashmiri impact Mr Gandhi s focus in the 50minutelong speech addressing 17000odd delegates was divided between the Bharat Jodo Yatra BJY and the Adani group Talking about the Jammu  Kashmir leg of the BJY the Congress leader said that the yatra had made Kashmiri youth carry the national flag even in terrorisminfested districts like Pulwama and Anantnag I heard the Prime Minister say in Parliament that he had also hoisted the national flag in Lal Chowk India s Prime Minister didn t understand the difference Narendra Modi ji along with 1520 BJP people hoisted the flag Bharat Jodo Yatra made lakhs of Kashmiri youth hoist the tricolour he said Cowardice Mr Gandhi also took on the BJP s nationalism plank by referring to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar s recent statement that as China was a big economy it was common sense not to pick a fight with it When the British ruled us was their economy smaller than ours Do you not fight if someone is stronger than you There is a word for this cowardice This is Vinayak Damodar Savarkar s ideology to bow down before the powerful An Indian Minister is telling China your economy is bigger and we can t fight with you  Do you call this nationalism What kind of patriotism is this he asked In the second half of his speech the Congress leader made a focussed attack on the Adani group and its relations with Mr Modi and his government The Adani connection When we asked in Parliament what is the Prime Minister s relation with Adani  our entire speech is expunged Mallikarjun Kharge ji s entire speech was expunged We will ask in Parliament thousands of times till the truth of Adani ji is out we will not stop Mr Gandhi said amid applause Repeating many of the points that he had raised in the Lok Sabha the Congress leader questioned how Mr Adani rose from the 609th to the second spot on the global billionaires list asked how India s foreign policy helped the Adani Group in countries like Israel Australia Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and expressed concerns about alleged shell companies especially given the Adani Group s involvement in the defence sector and other key sectors like airports ports agriculture and agricultural storage He also questioned why several Union Ministers had to come to the defence of one businessman I had asked a simple question on Modi ji and Adani ji s relationship  The simple answer could have been there is no relation  But there is a relation Adani ji and Modi are one Mr Gandhi said I want to tell the people who work for Adani ji s company that their company is hurting the country and it is snatching the entire infrastructure of country Mr Gandhi said Remember that the freedom struggle started against the East India Company and that too was a company History is being repeated This is against the country and if that happens the entire Congress party will stand against it he added After Mr Gandhi s allout attack on the Adani Group Congress general secretary organisation KC Venugopal announced that the party would undertake a series of programmes to expose the Modi government s link with the corporate group ,Warning that history is repeating itself  Mr Gandhi said that Modi ji and Adani ji are one and that was why the Opposition was not allowed to ask

Gautam Adani and loss for Bangladesh that is how the electricity purchase deal with the Indian business tycoon may turn out to be,None,Heads Adani Wins Tails Bangladesh Loses A Lopsided Power Deal,Gain is for Gautam Adani and loss for Bangladesh that is how the electricity purchase deal with the Indian business tycoon may turn out to be Now at the centre of a scandal over stock market manipulation and fraud that within a few weeks contributed to an epic fall from the position of Asia s richest person Adani has literally taken Bangladesh for a fortuneride through the controversial deal Though officially still kept under tight wraps the agreement has lately been published by a news portal and a number of whistleblowers in public interest This appears to be the most expensive lopsided contract to replenish the pockets of the exrichest man in Asia at the expense of the people in Bangladesh Tim Buckley a Sydneybased energy expert with 30 years of expertise in the field told The Daily Star over the phone recently Knowingly or unknowingly Bangladesh Power Development Board BPDB rushed to sign a deal that only allows Adani Power to mint money at every single phase from coal purchase to electricity export The document in essence lays bare how Bangladesh is forced to stay in the agreement even if Adani breaches the contract according to the experts who analysed a copy of the deal obtained by The Daily Star For the next 25 years Bangladesh will partially bear what was initially thought to be Adani Power s tax burden even though the Indian conglomerate got a tax exemption based on the export deal it struck with Bangladesh Also read Numbers Suggest Bangladesh Didn t Need the Adani Power Deal So Why Was it Signed And once the plant comes into commercial operation next month Bangladesh will start paying Adani reference tariffs based on taxes it does not even pay In other words the agreement has a unique design Adani saves costs but charges Bangladesh the same amount in turn raking more profits It is estimated that Adani Power will save over 1 billion on the Clean Energy Cess a form of carbon tax alone over the 25 years of the contract by virtue of becoming a Special Economic Zone SEZ according to an investigation by the Washington Post That s just the reduction from one type of tax Adani enjoys myriad other tax benefits and significant cost cuts for becoming an exportoriented plant through the deal with Bangladesh So the total savings for Adani will be way over 1 billion For example Adani also saves around 100 to 200 million on import duties of their equipment from China but it ll charge Bangladesh for the import duties Its profits will be hefty  to put it lightly Buckley said The Indian conglomerate however saw no evil When contacted a spokesperson from Adani on February 23 said The tax assumptions were uncertain when the deal was signed and we took a risk fixing the costs So the SEZ tax exemption is our savings in a lump sum contract  it is business Requesting anonymity for fear of reprisal the lawyer who reviewed the power purchase agreement for this paper begged to differ In a fair deal favouring both sides Adani s cut in costs from tax benefits would mean Bangladesh also gets shares of them or at least a portion of them However in another interview on February 24 another spokesperson for Adani said Since the Godda project is at a designated SEZ power consumers of Bangladesh will not have to pay for the customs duty taxes and cess as applicable per current norms Taxes and tariffs apart Bangladesh is liable to pay roughly 450 million a year in capacity charges even if it doesn t buy electricity from Adani due to any reason as stated in the original terms of the contract Buckley said A strong voice for the protection of natural resources Professor Anu Muhammad thinks that it is not a deal but a gift to Adani who is seen as the closest ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi As far as unfair deals go the Adani contract is recordbreaking he told The Daily Star Adani s possible breach of contract When signing the deal in 2017 Adani Power included a bevy of tax assumptions into the reference tariffs that Bangladesh will have to pay These include 12 percent excise duties 15 percent service tax VAT and income tax payable in India among others In February 2019 Adani s Godda Power Plant became a Special Economic Zone following amendments to guidelines that previously did not allow a standalone power plant to receive such benefits Only on the grounds of exporting electricity to Bangladesh Adani s Godda Power Plant was declared an SEZ according to the official documents of the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry To interpret it simply had it not been for Bangladesh Adani would not have received the exemption from the corporate taxes Most of Adani s expenditure in excise duties state goods and services tax have been nullified by the SEZ declaration along with a 100 percent deduction in income tax for the first five years A clause in the agreement 13d i stipulates that Adani must officially inform the BPDB of the change in tax assumptions within 30 days Another clause later in the document purports to allow the BPDB to recover the redundant tax charges but that too has legal barriers Almost four years after the SEZ declaration Adani has not officially in writing informed the BPDB of their exact savings said a BPDB official seeking anonymity for sharing what is seen as sensitive information  As per the Contract Act 1872 of Bangladesh Adani s concealment of information constitutes a breach of contract and renders the agreement legally void A previous analysis by the AdaniWatch  a nonprofit project of the Bob Brown Foundation that keeps an eye on the Adani Group s misdeeds across the planet  showed the violation and questioned whether the agreement is legally void In standard agreements the innocent party which is the BPDB in this case would have two options ask for compensation or terminate the agreement altogether But the contract is not legally void an unusual clause in the agreement prevents the BPDB from rescinding it Section 42 L states that the BPDB may give a notice of default in the case of any material breach by the company of this agreement Adani having a material and adverse effect on the company s ability to perform its obligations under the agreement that is not remedied within sixty 60 days This clause was not used in the power purchase agreements with Payra and Rampal according to the documents Also read Surprised We Don t Have a Hindenburg in India  Full Text of PN Vijay s Podcast Interview Put another way only when a breach of contract adversely affects Adani the BPDB has legal grounds to leave Hiding the amount of money it is saving from taxes does not hinder Adani s ability to produce As such the BPDB has no grounds to opt out of the 25year binding contract Adani did inform the BPDB of the change in taxes the Adani spokesperson told this paper The spokesperson was requested to provide proof with the written documentation sent to the BPDB Adani spokesperson declined stating the document is business confidential  The spokesperson said Ask the BPDB for the list of notifications we sent during the last 5 years If they have compiled correctly it should be there When we place the invoice it will be clear what the cost per unit is In our calculation it will be the lowest in Bangladesh claimed the Adani spokesperson Adani profits by not sharing tax benefits At each turn of the deal page after page Gautam Adani rakes in profits  on the Carmichael coalmine Adani s Australian mine that produces high ash low energy coal coal port railway line the power plant in Godda and part of the transmission line that he owns The agreement is cost plus plus said Buckley It has been designed in a manner that ensures Adani profits more and more and Bangladesh doesn t get a piece of that cake Each time Adani dangled a carrot in front of the BPDB the very next instance it took it away For example a clause in the agreement purports to reduce the capacity price when the taxes change Clause 13d iv states Following the commercial operations date a change in assumptions resulting in a onetime charge or expenditure or a onetime increase or decrease in a charge or expenditure shall cause an adjustment in the Reference Capacity Price Sounds fair The very facade of fairness Adani shows in clause iv is quickly counteracted by clause v that follows It states The parties expressly agree that no adjustment shall be applied or paid due to a change in assumption resulting from any change in taxes until the plant has been commissioned This provision further shows that the adjustment will not be done when it favours the BPDB which is the perfect example of discrimination said the lawyer who reviewed the agreement Hasan Mehedi member secretary of the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt BGWED gives an idea about logical readjustment in pricing Adani s tax cuts should ve decreased the capacity price by 1215 percent If we take the current exchange rate we will pay billions of dollars in 25 years when our foreign currency reserves are depleting Prof Anu Muhammad agrees There was clearly no negotiation here Adani dictated these terms and Bangladesh went along with it for political gains The lawyer said The misrepresentation aspect of the agreement is that Adani has created a clause that will not allow the BPDB to get any tax holiday or rebate so they can basically overcharge the capacity price Adani spokesperson said We have to factor in our savings in a business deal We made the power plant in Jharkhand to reduce our total cost as the value of land price was lower The design of the agreement is such that if there are additional taxes imposed by the Indian government those will not be imposed on Bangladesh The Indian government is now taking steps to ensure that every coalfired power plant will need to use biomass which will hamper our efficiency but those costs won t be borne by Bangladesh added the spokesperson Tim Buckley said avoiding corporate taxes has long been an avenue for Adani to reduce its costs of production and increase the profit margins Adani has also set up multiple ways to minimise the amount of tax it pays in Australia where it has its coal mine Filings in Singapore by privatelyowned Adani companies show that one of them Atulya Resources is registered in the British Virgin Islands a tax haven according to an investigation by ABC s Four Corners programme There is also an ability for 2 per tonne royalty to be paid off to tax a haven from the Carmichael coalmine So if Adani is buying 7 million tonnes of coal then there will be 14 million flying off to some tax haven  said Buckley Why did Bangladesh sign the deal Once US investment research firm Hindenburg blasted Adani Group s brazen stock manipulation and accounting schemes the alarm bells started ringing in Bangladesh Experts in Bangladesh who previously raised serious concerns regarding the deal are now questioning why the nation which has excess power generation capacity got on board with Adani When Hasan Mehedi coauthored an article with India s advocacy institution Growthwatch Bangladeshi officials hit back saying the report was done to ruin the relationship between Bangladesh and India  But our point remains and it s coming out now This deal will be disastrous for Bangladesh Mehedi said The same officials who signed previous agreements with foreign power plants okayed Adani s agreement knowing fully well that it does not favour Bangladesh A source in the BPDB requesting anonymity said We didn t get too much time to go through this agreement which was examined by the Power Division itself Also read Why the Modi Government Policy of National Champions Is Unravelling Contacted on many occasions the Power Division declined to comment on the matter The BPDB chairman was contacted but he refused to comment Nasrul Hamid the state minister for power energy and mineral resources responded to a phone call on February 25 but did not respond to specific questions As per his request The Daily Star sent him further questions over WhatsApp but he was yet to respond to those when this report was published Is there a way out Regarding ways out Section 194 of the power purchase agreement states that any dispute that is not resolved shall finally be settled in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre 2016 6th Edition The BPDB could ideally take the agreement to arbitration in Singapore for termination the lawyer told The Daily Star Anu Muhammad said The public will bear the cost of this expensive contract We can argue against the deal for it being agreed upon without considering the public interest of Bangladesh This article was

in for a treat,The same Adani stocks which led to one of the biggest losses in investors wealth in February became the positive factor to drive markets in the initial days of March All Adani stocks saw the best week with doubledigit gains last week for the first time after the Hindenburg report in late January The reason behind such stellar buying is attributed to foreign funds inflow through a series of block deals in four Adani companies The mega block deal comes as a sign of comfort among investors in embattled Adani Does that mean the latest rally in Adani shares has brought the bulls back to market Adani stocks have been under pressure since January 24th after a Hindenburg report accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation fraud and tax evasion While investigations are ongoing in Adani over these allegations however the mega block deal seems to have calmed the tide over Adani shares for now Last week GQG Partners which is one of the leading USbased global equity investment boutiques purchased equity shares of four Adani companies for a whopping 15446 crore in a series of secondary block deals Other foreign investors have also pumped funds into Adani shares These four companies are Adani Enterprises Adani Transmission Adani Total Gas and Adani Ports On Friday last week on BSE Adani Enterprises stock rose nearly 17 and Adani Ports was up nearly 10 While stocks like Adani Transmission Adani Power Adani Wilmar Adani Green Energy and Adani Total Gas hit 5 upper circuit The NDTV share price soared nearly 5 as well Meanwhile ACC was up over 5 and Ambuja Cements

nearly 18 Adani Wilmar zoomed nearly 17 and Adani Transmission advanced nearly 10 In cement business Ambuja Cements stock jumped over 14 and ACC up nearly 10 In media business NDTV rallied by at least 185 on BSE After markets made robust gains last week on Friday Naveen Kulkarni Chief Investment Officer Axis Securities said After the near USD 2bn investment by GQG partners in Adani Group the stock market has heaved a sigh of relief creating a kind of floor for Adani group stocks since a Marquee investor has invested in them at these prices Kulkarni believes that promoters can use the money raised through the transaction to infuse capital in any group company requiring the funds through warrants rights issues or any other instrument According to him this development will also lead to better sentiments for the market and increase retail participation which was down due to uncertainty He further said The investment also leads to a belief that the Adani group stocks have stabilized and can raise capital if they want at current prices He believes this development in Adani firms should support the banks especially PSU Banks which were hammered earlier despite good performance due to fear of their exposure to the Adani group Some of the banks that declared their exposure in Adani companies after the Hindenburg report the majority of them were from PSU banks These banks were also under pressure post the short sellers allegations against the Adani Group In February SBI stated that they have exposure of 27000 crore in Adani Group which is less than 1 of their total lending book While Bank of Baroda had revealed that their exposure does not fall under the top 10 of the exposures in Adani and also stated that around 30 of the banks exposure is backed by joint ventures with PSU Companies Further PNB had mentioned that it has approximately 7000 crore exposure in Adani of which 6300 crore was funded exposure Also PNB has around 2500 crore exposure in the groups airports business While Axis Bank had said that its exposure stood at 094 of its net advances in Adani Group Further the bank revealed that the fundbased exposure was 029 and nonfundbased outstanding loan exposure was 058 Also IndusInd Banks exposure in Adani came to around 049 of its total book Further the largest life insurer in India LIC also has some exposure to Adani but it is less than 1 of its total book LIC said it has 35917 crore under equity and debt at the end of December 2022 Even DBS Group Holdings revealed they have somewhat 13 billion 976 million exposure to Adani firms  of which  1 billion is from a cement business acquisition while 300 million is in other Adani firms It revealed they are not concerned about this exposure in Gautam Adanis firm Major rating agencies such as Fitch and Moodys have said earlier in February that Indian banks exposure in crisesladen Adani is not sufficient to give a substantial risk to these lenders credit profiles RBI deputy governor Mahesh Kumar Jain also said in a press conference during the month that domestic banks exposure in Adani is not very significant Has the mega block deal in Adani firms brought bulls back to market Kulkarni said We expect the markets to have a shortterm bounce back due to increased optimism but are still concerned about global interest rates and higher valuations which can lead to increased mediumterm volatility He added We advise investors to maintain investment discipline and keep investing regularly in equities for longterm wealth creation especially if the markets are volatile in the short to medium term Last week Nirav Karkera Head of Research Fisdom told Mint that the recent spurt in Adani stocks needs to sustain for longer before one can distinctly recognize it as either entering a new range the beginning of a fresh rally or at least not simply a deadcat bounce Karkera added the stocks still remain highly sensitive to reported developments Some spurt has been visible on a couple of counters owing to block purchases but this may not really be an indicator of anything more than the buying entity s conviction in the company s growth prospects at the moment GQG Partners who made one of the biggest buying through block deals said it believes in Adanis longterm growth prospects One of the major reasons behind investment in Adani firms as per Rajiv Jain Chairman and CIO of GQG Partners would be that these companies own and operate some of the largest and most important infrastructure assets throughout India and around the world Rajiv said We believe that the longterm growth prospects for these companies are substantial and we are pleased to be investing in companies that will help advance India s economy and energy infrastructure including their energy transition over the long run Disclaimer The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies and not of Mint We advise investors to check with

at Adani stocks,Many major rating agencies have lowered their outlook in some Adani Groupbacked companies to Negative from Stable in recent times The reason behind lowering the outlook is due to risks in the financial flexibility of the Group after the Hindenburg report which led to a relentless selloff in these stocks in February However the rating actions could not tame the bulls in the majority of Adani stocks In the week that ended March 10th except for Adani Enterprises and the cement business the rest of the Adaniled stocks surged in the week On Friday Adani stocks saw a mixed sentiment The flagship firm Adani Enterprises stock dropped by nearly 3 while Adani Wilmar tumbled by at least 45 Adani Ports closed on a flat note Also in cement stocks Ambuja Cements dipped by 2 and ACC shed

climbed over 3 As of March 10 2023 Adani Enterprises mcap is around 21619551 crore while Adani Ports mcap stood at 1507453 crore These two are the most valued firms of the Adani Group in terms of

Wilmars at 5891443 crore Ambuja at 7512689 crore ACC at 3468712 crore and NDTV at 150702 crore Moodysbacked ICRA was among the first to trim its outlook to Negative on two Adani companies on March 3rd These were Adani Ports and Adani Total Gas Earlier their outlook was stable However ICRA reaffirmed its rating According to ICRA the reason behind the lowering in the outlook of these two Adani companies was due to a deterioration in the groups financial flexibility Adani Groups financial flexibility has deteriorated after Hindenburgs report on January 24 The short sellers critical report led to steep declines in share prices and an increase in the yield of international bonds raised by the groups entities While last week India Ratings also assigned a Negative outlook on Adani Green Energy and Adani Enterprises from their previous Stable Also CARE Edge trimmed its outlook to Negative on Adani Enterprises In regards to Adani Enterprises IndRas negative outlook on the company is due to the uncertainty on the cash flow mismatches resulting from the revised capex plans and the possible sources of funding available which may keep the equity cover lower than 2x While CARE Edges rating action on Adanis flagship company was due to the expected moderation in the financial flexibility of the Adani group in case of any adverse outcome or observations from the ongoing regulatory and legal scrutiny directed by the Honourable Supreme Court of India in connection with various allegations against the Adani group of companies After the apex courts direction market regulator Sebi is expected to complete the examination pertaining to the lapses in reporting mechanisms disclosure adequacies and manipulation of stock prices amidst other aspects of investigation in a timebound manner However both IndRa and CARE believe that the latest fundraising of 15446 crore from GQG Partners alleviates the risk to some extent in these companies and could aid in liquidity to a certain degree Meanwhile the cement stocks were under pressure after a report stated that Gautam Adani the chairperson of the Adani Group is planning to sell a stake in the cement business for 450 million with the aim to reduce debt Adani is looking to sell a 45 stake in Ambuja Cement to international lenders reported Financial Times quoting sources Overall Adani stocks were in the green due to the mega block deal by GQG Partners which sort of brings some comfort among investors,The flagship firm Adani Enterprises stock dropped by nearly 3 while Adani Wilmar tumbled by at least 45On the positive

Bank says it has a small exposure to embattled conglomerate,Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank on Thursday said that it has a small exposure to the embattled Adani Group which has been made in line with its credit philosophy Paritosh Kashyap president and head for wholesale banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank told PTI that the issues surrounding Adani Group are more of a capital market and valuations issue and not a credit issue We have a small exposure to the group We do business with every corporate in the country and our exposures are in line with our credit philosophy and the size of our balance sheet Kashyap said He added that operating companies in the group have reasonable leverage coupled with strong profitability and balance sheets The embattled conglomerate has been under surveillance by different government bodies after US short seller Hindenburg Research in a scathing report noted that the conglomerate is misusing tax havens and accused it of financial misdeeds accounting fraud and stock manipulation It also said that the stocks are overvalued by 85 per cent Also read A battle lies ahead for Adani Group CFO Jugeshinder Singh after Hindenburg blow Also read AdaniHindenburg saga Fund managers say governance transparency issues still loom large over Adani The report which was published on January 24 led to a massive rout in Adani Groups listed companies stocks which made investors nervous Kashyap of Kotak Mahindra Bank said the overall wholesale banking book is bereft of any stress for Kotak Mahindra Bank and also expressed concerns about the lack of any stress emerging for over seven years now As a segment I cant say anyone which has a stress he said adding that the bank is open to doing business with segments like infrastructure real estate and lending to nonbanks which is otherwise considered as prone to stress The Adani Group which has companies in sectors such as energy infrastructure and ports has been the subject of scrutiny by investors following the rout This is mainly due to concerns over the Groups high leverage and its impact on the banking sector and governmentowned financial institutions like the Life Insurance Corporation LIC of India A CLSA recent report has highlighted that 3940 per cent of the companys debt which is close to Rs 2 lakh cr is from the Indian banking sector from PSUs to private banks The Reserve Bank of India RBI has launched a special examination of the banking systems exposures to Adani Group entities and Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that a single case cannot impact the broader banking system According to experts the Indian banks exposures are to operative companies and not against shares at the listed holding company level This is so because in most cases barring asset buys by infrastructure companies Indian banks are not allowed to lend more than Rs 20 lakh as loans against shares which has come in as a helpful regulatory mandate Earlier the country s biggest lender State Bank of India SBI Bank of Baroda and Life Insurance Corporation had clarified their exposures and assured investors that the debts are well in order Last month SBI said its overall exposure to Adani Group is about 09 per cent of its total loan book which was about Rs 27000 crore and it has not extended any loan against shares to the group Insurance behemoth LIC also came out with its stand It said its overall exposure is over Rs 35000 crore with a large part of it being in equity investments which have suffered alongside the rout in stocks and some reports pegging the valuations dipping below the purchase price as well The insurance major has invested in seven of 10 listed companies of the Adani Group As of December 2022 LIC held 914 per cent in Adani Ports 596 per cent in Adani Total Gas 423 per cent in Adani Enterprises 365 per cent in Adani Transmission and 128 per cent in Adani Green Energy Since the report was made public LICs exposure to Adani group firms stock has come under scrutiny The group after the report was out said the total purchase value of equity purchased over the last many years under all the Adani Group companies was over Rs 36000 crore and the market value as on January 27 was Rs 56142 crore In midFebruary the staterun insurance company lost nearly Rs 50000 crore on its investments in the Adani Group stocks The combined market value of its

The Economic Times,2023-03-16 14:18:45.485682,Dont blame SVB or Adani for dull market broad bull market unlikely in India anytime soon Shankar Sharma,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/dont-blame-svb-or-adani-for-dull-market-broad-bull-market-unlikely-in-india-anytime-soon-shankar-sharma/articleshow/98652431.cms, Good fixed income returns is a good reason to attribute the equity markets underperformance in India Adani or the foreign bank thing are very temporary,None,Bull Market Dont blame SVB or Adani for dull market broad bull market unlikely in India anytime soon Shankar Sharma, The Adani Group or SVB was not the reason why the Indian markets have been somnolent in the last two or three months The reasons are more internal The reasons are that there is a slowdown in the economy based on the GDP numbers that we have seen says market veteranYes you can call it the midpoint It is a very boring sideways market It might look exciting because it has been down from the peaks a bit but it has been a very slow grinding fall most of the time So yes it has been quiet And quiet is good There is no reason to come to the market for excitement2008 was the first time we saw a banking crisis of that order in living memory There can be routine failures in India too in 2000 Global Trust Bank failed In 90s also a couple of banks failed Those are individual events In the US there have been a lot of bank failures There are community banks The US is a huge country like India and there are small banks serving the local community They keep going burst if you look at the dataBut 2008 was a completely different animal in which there was a largescale collapse of the financial system itself not just lending banks but investment banks and brokers and everything Everything from Merrill Lynch to Lehman to Washington Mutual to AIG which is an insurance company It was a completely different order of magnitude Compared to that we would take SVB or the Signature Bank collapse any dayThe other thing is regulators learn to act very quickly There is always learning with a new event So 2008 will not get repeated by any stretch I mean let us not even start thinking like thatI completely agree with that I do not think SVB is the problem If indeed you want to look for problems the problems may well be more internal to India than an external shock like a largescale banking contagion in the US That will have its occasional day in the sun but that is not the reason why India has underperformed this year It is a completely different set of reasons altogetherI think Adani was a nonissue for any serious investor in the stock markets We made it an issue beyond what it deserved to be It is a large group but still one group and one group cannot be said to be representative of the entire market no matter which group that is We have had governance problems with Infosys  We have had governance problems with Reliance not one but maybe a dozen of them Sebi has passed orders against Reliance promoters against Mukesh Ambani or against Reliance company or group companies Sun Pharma  a marquee company has had a series of problems in the last threefour years time None of that has been represented in the public eye as if that is going to dent the image of India or is an attack on India It is all complete and total nonsense This is a group problem The group is dealing with it and more power to them They are important for the growth of certain parts of India which is the infrastructure part and I hope and I pray that they come out of it But to extend that to say the market is going to suffer because of that is a complete non sequitur in my viewWe draw false positives and false correlations and causalities The Adani Group or SVB was not the reason why the Indian markets have been somnolent in the last two or three months time The reasons are more internal The reasons are that there is a slowdown in the economy based on the GDP numbers that we have seen The markets have been sensing that and I speak to companies all the time and right after Diwali from Diwali onward last year I started to get a sense that there was a slowdown in spendingRural economy has been hurting in any case It was urban spending which was propping it up and that has also started to slow down That is where the market started to get a bit jittery It is not Adani it is not a foreign bank contagionYou are absolutely spot on The competition for the market is the fixed income part it is a much detested cousin because all of us are equity guys We do not like fixed income in most part but it is providing in India and globally some amazing returns In the US like I tweeted you can buy good quality bond ETFs for now for about 5 55 6 yields even 7 yields Real estate investment interests are like 9 10 11 12 yieldsIn Singapore also you can get fairly decent yields In India the yields are really mouthwatering to say the least which provide you low volatility returns for an average investor Again that is a good reason to attribute the equity markets underperformance in India Adani or the foreign bank thing are very temporary phenomena it is more fundamental and which is that rates are very attractive and people are at this point choosing fixed income over equitiesAgain I go back to my point that the economy being what it is my belief is you are not going to get a broad bull market I do not think any of us should hold out hope that we are going to see a broad bull market in India anytime soon We are going to see very patchy markets in which a reasonable part of the markets will be flat or even down while small pockets of stocks whether in the Nifty or below the Nifty will be doing well and that is really the skill of your investment acumen will be tested this year, The Adani Group or SVB was not the reason why the Indian markets have been somnolent in the last two or three monthsThat will have its occasional day in the sun but that is not the reason why India has underperformed this yearIn India the yields are really mouthwatering to say the least which provide you low volatility returns for an average investorAgain that is a good reason to attribute the equity markets underperformance in IndiaI do not think any of us should hold out hope that we are going to see a broad bull market in India anytime soon,Not Available,"['bull', 'shankar', 'problems', 'unlikely', 'markets', 'reason', 'group', 'india', 'soon', 'dont', 'banks', 'dull', 'going', 'svb',

four of the Adani firms  Adani Green Energy Adani Total Gas Adani Transmission and Adani Enterprises  have negative free cash flows Negative free cash flow means that a business has more outgoing

faced a stock rout which halved the company s market valuation And the company started prepaying sharebacked loans possibly to regain investors confidence Meanwhile it s halting some proposed investments and acquisitions For instance Adani Power called off the acquisition of DB Power for around Rs 7000 crore after missing the latest deadline to complete the transaction the Financial Times

commercial papers from some domestic mutual funds ahead of their maturity the Morning Context reported Commercial papers are unsecured shortterm debt instruments issued by companies to finance

posed questions on Twitter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Adani issue as part of the opposition,None,Congress says NSE lifted additional surveillance on Adani Group stocks questions SEBI s inaction ,PTI New Delhi March 17 The Congress claimed on Friday that the National Stock Exchange NSE has lifted additional surveillance on some Adani Group company stocks and asked why stock exchange regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI is standing by and allowing investors to take on added exposure to such stocks Congress general secretary communications Jairam Ramesh posed questions on Twitter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Adani issue as part of the opposition party s Hum Adanike Hain Kaun series Another day of adjournment and protest The PMlinked Adani Maha Mega Scam continues to be the subject of agitation by the Opposition and stonewalling by the Government Here is HAHK Hum Adanike Hain Kaun31 Chuppi Todiye Pradhan Mantriji Ramesh said in a tweet He claimed that even as global index providers such as MSCI SP Dow Jones and FTSE Russell reviewed the position of the Adani stocks in their equity indices the NSE went the other way and included five Adani Group companies in no less than 14 indices beginning Monday March 20 as pointed out in the HAHK series on February 20 This week Ramesh claimed the NSE announced that Adani Enterprises Adani Power and Adani Wilmar would from Friday March 17 exit the additional surveillance mechanism framework that was put in place to protect investors from excessive risk Surely the timing is not a coincidence Why is SEBI standing by as the NSE chooses to protect the Adani Group s interests rather than that of lakhs of small investors Why is SEBI allowing index investors to take on additional exposure to Adani Group stocks when financial advisors who generally wealthier investors can afford have been advising their clients to avoid investing in Adani Group stocks the Congress leader asked In another poser made by Ramesh he said almost a month after the revelations of wrongdoing in the Adani Group the CEO of the Bank of Baroda said the bank would continue to lend money to the business conglomerate led by industrialist Gautam Adani This statement came at a time when the value of Adani collateral in the form of pledged stock had collapsed by more than half prompting margin calls by big global lenders concerned about repayment and fresh questions about the group s ability to service and repay its huge debt Note that the Bank of Baroda is a leading public sector bank that is owned by the people of India not by PM Modi or the CEO Was this yet another case of phone banking by your government Is it true that the CEO was subsequently asked to clarify his statement by Members of Parliament on 6 March 2023 at a historic south Indian location and if so will you share his answer with the people of India Ramesh asked The Rajya Sabha MP of the Congress also said the Gujarat Maritime Board GMB was set up in 1982 to oversee the state s minor ports  but appears to have simply become another instrument for the enrichment of your cronies  Citing a 2014 Comptroller and Auditor General CAG report he said it had found that Adani Ports had benefitted to the tune of Rs 11812 crore after the GMB applied incorrect royalty rates to a newlybuilt quay at the Mundra port More importantly the CAG found that no system to monitor the construction activities at the private ports was in existence and that the MIS did not provide performancerelated details on the activities of the ports  The benefit to Adani Ports the dominant ports player in the state of this nonexistent monitoring may therefore have been many multiples of the observed Rs 118 crore he said The Congress leader has so far posed 93 questions to the government under the HAHK series The opposition party is seeking to corner the BJPled Centre on the Adani issue ever since USbased short seller Hindenburg Research came up with a research paper alleging financial irregularities and stock manipulation by the business group The Adani Group has rejected the allegations and denied any wrongdoing Adani,This week Ramesh claimed the NSE announced that Adani Enterprises Adani Power and Adani Wilmar would from Friday March 17 exit the additional surveillance mechanism framework that was put in place to

Tribune India,2023-03-16 14:18:47.485659,Congress says NSE lifted additional surveillance on Adani Group stocks questions SEBI s inaction ,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-says-nse-lifted-additional-surveillance-on-adani-group-stocks-questions-sebis-inaction-488906,Congress general secretary communications Jairam Ramesh posed questions on Twitter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Adani issue as part of the opposition,None,Congress says NSE lifted additional surveillance on Adani Group stocks questions SEBI s inaction ,PTI New Delhi March 17 The Congress claimed on Friday that the National Stock Exchange NSE has lifted additional surveillance on some Adani Group company stocks and asked why stock exchange regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI is standing by and allowing investors to take on added exposure to such stocks Congress general secretary communications Jairam Ramesh posed questions on Twitter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Adani issue as part of the opposition party s Hum Adanike Hain Kaun series Another day of adjournment and protest The PMlinked Adani Maha Mega Scam continues to be the subject of agitation by the Opposition and stonewalling by the Government Here is HAHK Hum Adanike Hain Kaun31 Chuppi Todiye Pradhan Mantriji Ramesh said in a tweet He claimed that even as global index providers such as MSCI SP Dow Jones and FTSE Russell reviewed the position of the Adani stocks in their equity indices the NSE went the other way and included five Adani Group companies in no less than 14 indices beginning Monday March 20 as pointed out in the HAHK series on February 20 This week Ramesh claimed the NSE announced that Adani Enterprises Adani Power and Adani Wilmar would from Friday March 17 exit the additional surveillance mechanism framework that was put in place to protect investors from excessive risk Surely the timing is not a coincidence Why is SEBI standing by as the NSE chooses to protect the Adani Group s interests rather than that of lakhs of small investors Why is SEBI allowing index investors to take on additional exposure to Adani Group stocks when financial advisors who generally wealthier investors can afford have been advising their clients to avoid investing in Adani Group stocks the Congress leader asked In another poser made by Ramesh he said almost a month after the revelations of wrongdoing in the Adani Group the CEO of the Bank of Baroda said the bank would continue to lend money to the business conglomerate led by industrialist Gautam Adani This statement came at a time when the value of Adani collateral in the form of pledged stock had collapsed by more than half prompting margin calls by big global lenders concerned about repayment and fresh questions about the group s ability to service and repay its huge debt Note that the Bank of Baroda is a leading public sector bank that is owned by the people of India not by PM Modi or the CEO Was this yet another case of phone banking by your government Is it true that the CEO was subsequently asked to clarify his statement by Members of Parliament on 6 March 2023 at a historic south Indian location and if so will you share his answer with the people of India Ramesh asked The Rajya Sabha MP of the Congress also said the Gujarat Maritime Board GMB was set up in 1982 to oversee the state s minor ports  but appears to have simply become another instrument for the enrichment of your cronies  Citing a 2014 Comptroller and Auditor General CAG report he said it had found that Adani Ports had benefitted to the tune of Rs 11812 crore after the GMB applied incorrect royalty rates to a newlybuilt quay at the Mundra port More importantly the CAG found that no system to monitor the construction activities at the private ports was in existence and that the MIS did not provide performancerelated details on the activities of the ports  The benefit to Adani Ports the dominant ports player in the state of this nonexistent monitoring may therefore have been many multiples of the observed Rs 118 crore he said The Congress leader has so far posed 93 questions to the government under the HAHK series The opposition party is seeking to corner the BJPled Centre on the Adani issue ever since USbased short seller Hindenburg Research came up with a research paper alleging financial irregularities and stock manipulation by the business group The Adani Group has rejected the allegations and denied any wrongdoing Adani,This week Ramesh claimed the NSE announced that Adani Enterprises Adani Power and Adani Wilmar would from Friday March 17 exit the additional surveillance mechanism framework that was put in place to protect investors from excessive riskWhy is SEBI allowing index investors to take on additional exposure to Adani Group stocks when financial advisors who generally wealthier investors can afford have

dark history hidden under diamonds and inflated bills The Adani Group s rise to become one of the top business empires in the world might have seen an unprecedented surge in the last nine years By Telangana Today Published Date  0835 PM Sun  19 March 23 The Adani Group s rise to become one of the top business empires in the world might have seen an unprecedented surge in the last nine years But fraud right from siphoning funds offshore and market manipulation of share prices of the group in India are nothing new to the group In fact the Adani Group s shady affairs were revealed as early as in 1999 when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence arrested Rajesh Adani a younger brother of Gautam Adani and currently the managing director of the Adani Group on charges of evading customs duties He was arrested several times again on charges of customs fraud too most recently in 2013 The DRI also investigated the 200406 diamond scam in which Rajesh Adani and Gautam Adani s brotherinlaw Samir Vora were accused of circular trading of diamonds and overinvoicing so as to siphon funds to tax havens like Dubai and Singapore and also of fraudulently claiming export subsidies In 2013 the Commissioner of Customs imposed fines on Rajesh Adani Samir Vora Adani Enterprises and five diamond trading companies linked to the Adani Group However in 2015 soon after the Modi government came to power the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal CESTAT dismissed the findings of investigations that spanned several years Much before that in 2007 the Adani Group was banned by the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI from participation in the securities market for two years The SEBI passed the order after it found the involvement of promoters of Adani  along with controversial stock broker Ketan Parekh and his associates  in the price rigging of Adani stocks between October 1999 and March 2001 DRI investigation still pending before SC In 201314 intelligence was gathered by the DRI that certain power sector companies were involved in overinvoicing of coal and power generation equipment imported from abroad It was detected that Indonesian coal was shipped directly to India but the import invoices were routed by the companies through one or more intermediaries based in countries such as Singapore Dubai Hong Kong etc for the artificial inflation of value which ultimately impacted the power bills of end users through passing on of costs The coal import scam was estimated to be at around Rs29000 crore The objective of overvaluation appeared to have been to siphon off money abroad and to avail higher power tariff compensation based on the artificiallyinflated cost of the imported coal A general alert circular was issued in March 2016 about the modus operandi of overinvoicing of Indonesian coal indulged in by some 40 companies The circular listed names of 40 companies out of which 10 entities including suppliers were directly related to Adani As the next step the DRI in 2016 obtained a Letters Rogatory LR which is sent by a country under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty MLAT for the assistance of foreign judicial authorities in probing an offshore entity Accordingly the DRI petitioned the governments of Singapore Dubai and Hong Kong for assistance in gaining access to the overseas bank records of stateowned Indian banks whose accounts were used to facilitate the scam Almost 85 percent of the fraudulent overinvoicing done by these companies took place through SBI s Singapore branch according to the DRI Despite having clinching evidence in hand the DRI s probe reached a dead end due to the noncooperation of banks citing reasons of international legal agreements with the countries concerned It looks like an invisible outside hand is stopping it from happening one of the officials was quoted as saying by India Today Adani challenged the LR request in one of his group firms Adani Enterprises Ltd in the Singapore lower court which disagreed and ordered the company to turn over its records Adani appealed against the order in the Singapore High Court and failed there as well However where he succeeded was at the Bombay High Court where he challenged the issuance of the LR itself following which the HC quashed all LR proceedings citing technicalities The Supreme Court stayed the order of the Bombay High Court in 2020 Earlier two firms of the Adani Group allegedly involved in overvaluation of imported power equipment were served show cause notices on May 15 2014 The DRI stated that the goods  power generation and transmission equipment  imported by the firms APML and APRL in 2009 and 2010 were shipped directly to India by original equipment manufacturers based in China and South Korea while the documents were routed through an intermediary entity Electrogen Infra FZE UAE EIF created in Dubai The value of the equipment was inflated by nearly 400 percent ie Rs4000 cr According to the DRI EIF was owned and controlled by Vinod Shantilal Adani the eldest of the Adani brothers The DRI alleged that the Adani firms transacted with EIF a related party to siphon off Rs4000 crore abroad However at the first appellate level the Commissioner disposed of the case in 2017 in favour of Adani The second appellate CESTAT also decided in favour of Adani The appeals are still pending in the Supreme Court,In fact the Adani Group s shady affairs were revealed as early as in 1999 when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence arrested Rajesh Adani a younger brother of Gautam Adani and currently the managing

13157km crossborder IndoBangla Friendship Pipeline through which Bangladesh will import highspeed diesel from Assam The occasion was the virtual inauguration of a 13157km crossborder IndoBangla Friendship Pipeline through which Bangladesh will import highspeed diesel from the Numaligarh refinery in Assam Modi in the presence of his counterpart Sheikh Hasina spoke at length about the progress made in energy cooperation between their countries Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued with his silence on Adani on Saturday though he would have had every reason to mention Adani Power whose entry into Bangladesh owed to his patronage at an event celebrating a new phase in DelhiDhaka cooperation over energy Eight years ago Modi had laid the groundwork for Adani Power s entry into Bangladesh as part of India s commitment to improving the power situation in the neighbouring country and beginning an extensive crossborder power trade A joint declaration issued by the external affairs ministry after Modi s Bangladesh visit in June 2015 said He Modi also conveyed that India can be a major partner in achieving this goal and many Indian corporates have the capacity to cooperate with Bangladesh in this endeavour He requested Prime Minister Hasina for facilitating the entry of Indian companies in the power generation transmission and distribution sector of Bangladesh Two years after Modi s visit the Bangladesh Power Development Board BPDB signed a 25year power purchase agreement PPA with Adani Power in November 2017 The deal was for the Indian company to supply 1496MW of electricity from a coalbased power plant at Godda in Jharkhand With Adani Power Jharkhand having begun supplying power to Bangladesh from the Godda plant earlier this month Modi perceived as the architect of the crossborder power trade would perhaps have been expected to mention the fact But he persisted with his silence on the Adani group which has been in the thick of controversy amid allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation The Congress accuses Modi of preferential treatment of the group because of his proximity to Adani In the field of energy our mutual cooperation has been very successful Today India supplies more than 1100MW electricity to Bangladesh Modi said at Saturday s programme The first unit of the Maitree super thermal power plant a 5050 joint venture between the BPDB and India s NTPC is already operational The second unit will also be operational soon Modi said the petroleum trade between the two countries had crossed 1 billion He spoke of how the pipeline  through which Dhaka is to import diesel at a cheaper cost and with lower carbon emission  would give a push to the Bangladesh economy by facilitating the growth of both agriculture and industry Under normal circumstances a mention of the deal between Adani Power and the BPDB in the Indian Prime Minister s address would have been natural but we all know the controversies surrounding the group in India a source in Bangladesh said Another reason behind the act of omission could be the controversy in Bangladesh over the deal Segments of Bangladesh civil society and media have demanded scrapping of the purchase deal with Adani Power calling it unfair and steeped in a profiteering motive  Over the past one month or so several news reports in the Bangladeshi media  based on the 163page PPA  have contended that Dhaka would be paying through its nose for electricity from the Godda plant That Bangladesh authorities too had apprehensions about the cost of electricity from Adani Power Jharkhand became clear in recent months with the BPDB seeking revisions to the PPA which prompted representatives of the conglomerate to rush to Dhaka at least twice to assuage the concerns The Adani representatives were here last week too They have given an assurance that the cost of electricity from their plant would be on a par with  or even cheaper than  that from other thermal power plants a source in Bangladesh said Multiple sources in the Bangladesh government said that although the PPA was iron clad  the process of bargaining with the Adani authorities had become easier because of the problems the conglomerate is facing in India The company is likely to raise its first bill to the BPDB in April It will become clear then that we have struck a favourable bargain after all the controversy a source said The pipeline will play a significant role in protecting the energy security of our people and quicken the country s development Hasina said,Prime Minister Narendra Modi

growth,https://theprint.in/national-interest/youve-heard-of-jobless-growth-but-tata-birla-ambani-adani-have-given-india-brandless-growth/1452558/,But Tata Birla Ambani Adani have given India brandless growth Modi govts thrust on manufacturing is muchneeded but it is pushing Indian manufacturing in,2023-03-18 02:34:54+00:00,You ve heard of jobless growth But Tata Birla Ambani Adani have given India brandless growth,The Adani controversy brings to our attention some related aspects of India s political economy The most immediate one is the opposition s allegation of cronyism Which when elaborated becomes a larger theme encompassing the top four or five leaders of corporate India You can add Ambani Tata Birla and Vedanta to the list All these qualify to be called conglomerates They all have interests in diverse fields This to be sure isn t a definitive or comprehensive list The Tatas for example are often described as a salttosoftware group They produce automobiles and military aircraft run a massive and diverse airline business now and also make steel Mukesh Ambani s Reliance Group spans a wide range of businesses too from refining to telecom as the main course to retail and even biosciences research and some media thrown in the dessert trolley The Aditya Birla Group has interests in metals aluminium in particular telecom cement yarns and more Vedanta is still mostly into metals but is now on the energy oil and gas production radar too All these have three things in common One they are all legacy or at least familycontrolled enterprises Reliance Ambani and Birla are empires founded by the previous generations Vedanta and Adani have firstgeneration founders who control their businesses directly The extent to which members of the family are in control of key businesses can vary from Adani at one extreme to Tata at the other Two all these have most of their businesses in areas where the government overhang is heavy and decisive These are highly regulated areas and often  especially in the case of Adani  monopolies by definition Think Mumbai airport and electricity distribution or Mundra Port or the mega plants with power purchase agreements The same applies to refining and telecom mining and oilfield concessions A direct and extensive interaction with the state is critical to these Third and the most important for this week s discussion is that none of them owns a truly global Indian brand There will be protests from the Tatas I understand because they have the Taj Hotels and now Air India is back with them I d say with some humility that Taj is still not a hotel brand to awe the world  probably because they work in so many categories from superluxury Palaces to the very workingclass Ginger And Air India was felled by the sarkari kiss of death decades ago and it will take some doing now to bring it back to its old glory Also Read Market has won  now it s for Adani to decide whether he will lose or not Much of the criticism Adani has faced in particular stems from his proximity to the Modi government especially given how critical working with the state is for his main businesses If running ports on India s coast is a business fully regulated by the government buying port assets overseas is impossible without a supportive government Whether that s a good thing or bad isn t the question In polarised debate it can often be seen as bordering on cronyism The Congress for example cites this as a case of the Modi government running foreign policy to serve their friend Adani s interest  Others might see it as important that any government work closely with powerful Indian conglomerates to compete overseas especially with a rampant China with its Belt and Road Initiative and unlimited treasury Similarly think of the airports highways railways tunnels metros and much else that is being built in India now as The Economist noted in its latest issue You ll need companies that have deep pockets and large balance sheets to build so much infrastructure Would you leave it to Bechtels of the world to come and do it for you or would you rather have Indian conglomerates do it Nobody can do it without working closely with the government so that isn t the issue The debate therefore has to be about whether there is a level playing field for all comers The Bechtels included This statecorporate cooperation nexus if you are conspiratorially minded didn t begin with the arrival of the Modi government Many of the big licences contracts and even environmental clearances for the Adani Group had come in the time of the UPA Of course they will insist they did it fairly after asking the right questions and giving all competitors an equal chance But the fact is there are so many areas in a growing economy with desperate hunger for infrastructure that private capital and the state will need to work closely together We ve discussed the Adani case in greater detail because it is the subject of most of today s debate But all these conglomerates do most of their business in India and in areas where they can t escape the government s shadow Much of their revenue is domestic as well There are exceptions for sure like the Tatas software business To understand this better look at the case of the Dhamra Port on India s still poorly served eastern seaboard The Tatas built it in the face of heavy odds in particular opposition from environmental activists who had a much greater say under the UPA dispensation There were questions and litigation ranging from whether it was consuming reserved forest land to the feared destruction of the nesting sites of Olive Ridley turtles The legal clearances did finally come in the UPA era if after much delay because  despite its devotion to environmental activism  that government s top leaders were too wise not to understand the vital need for another efficient port in the east The UPA didn t block it That the Tatas finally sold it to the Adanis is another story While many would believe the insinuation that the Tatas must ve been armtwisted into selling it to the Adanis it wouldn t pass a most elementary fact check The deal was negotiated and concluded under UPAII and announced on 16 May 2014 as election results had just begun to come in Also Read Is India shining again Why flashing victory sign too soon is a perilous national trait The third point is that the failure of these superpowerful Indian corporations to build global brands is a real disappointment We can classify brands broadly in three categories country company and product brands respectively In the first category India has some  yoga ayurveda spirituality maybe Engineering and maths talent IITs and IIMs generic pharma You can add more to the list There are powerful Indian company brands known across the world at least in business circles Tata Reliance Vedanta and some companies within the conglomerates like TCS Then Infosys Wipro HCL and other tech companies None of them however has created a product brand that rules the world India does not have a purely homemade car a twowheeler a software or operating system not even a perfume or a beverage We are collecting GI tags for scores of products  mostly agri and handicrafts  and yet not a brand that looks out from shop shelves globally Corporate India has failed to create a garment brand and almost all that our factories produce and export is sold under the labels of international store chains To that extent our garment makers are also doing outsourced work Which is precisely what the Modi government is now promising in its larger manufacturing push with incentives like PLI and other concessions While it s great that India is now making a lot of mobile phones for export none of these carries an Indian brand name The Chinese and Koreans on the other hand have spawned a halfdozen brands that dominate global markets The Modi government s manufacturing push is very good and necessary but basically it is pushing Indian manufacturing in the same direction as our software services industry outsourcing Cronyism is abhorrent and it s good that it s now being debated so robustly But the much bigger failure of these incredibly powerful rich and successful companies and of the state policy lies in India s fully brandfree economic growth Also Read G2024 How Vishwaguru can get new strategic space  Modi another stage in preelection year,Third and the most important for this week s discussion is that none of them owns a truly global Indian brandOthers might see it as

suggest a potential failure of corporate governance that may call for a relook,2023-03-23 23:08:36+05:30,The Adani affair revealed gaping holes in governance,Corporate governance scandals follow a distinct pattern worldwide We assume regulators auditors and stock exchanges are doing their jobs in preventing fraud and malfeasance Then a major scam happens like at Enron Volkswagen Theranos etc Everyone proposes governance reforms and we think the problem is solved until the next scandal hits The recent Adani scandal again highlights our need for better regulations and effective corporate governance In 2020 much before Hindenburg s report allegations had arisen that the group was involved in fraud money laundering and environmental destruction The group was accused of concealing losses in subsidiaries inflating profits and using complex offshore structures to avoid taxes Overinvoiced imports to siphon money abroad was another charge As proper oversight could have flagged such issues in time this fiasco raises questions of corporate governance in India The term refers to the system of rules practices and processes by which a company is directed and controlled It encompasses everything from the oversight role of a board of directors over its management to internal controls audit practices and risk buffers The goal of governance is to see that a company operates ethically transparently and in the best interests of all stakeholders India s Companies Act of 2013 sets out a legal framework for it with guidelines and rules governing various aspects Yet the Adani episode exposed loopholes The primary problem identified was a lack of independent directors with group company boards comprising mostly family members and close associates Another issue was lack of transparency in its financial reporting Adani Group companies have been accused of using complex structures to evade taxes and manipulate stock prices While India does have a robust legal framework weak enforcement seems to be a problem This is compounded by business ties with politics that could make it difficult for regulators to act against powerful corporate entities The role of auditors has also been placed in a spotlight They must verify financial statements for accuracy and reliability However they are often caught napping or looking away To address these issues India may need to strengthen its corporate governance framework Ties of business with politics need to be explained Other measures should be aimed at increasing transparency in ownership structures enhancing the independence and accountability of auditors and improving the enforcement of rules Regulators and policymakers must work together to create a level playing field for all businesses regardless of their size or political connections Indian opposition leaders accuse the Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi of laxity in investigating charges against Adani As a regulator it should have full independence in conducting a probe Remember the fate of recommendations on governance made by a panel led by Uday Kotak Powerful business lobbies got to work their implementation was first delayed and now seems shelved This sort of thing mustn t happen anymore Given the impact on India s stock market of charges against the Adani Group Sebi which was seized of questions over its adherence to freefloat norms well before the Hindenburg report appeared should have been on alert Anyhow here is what can be done now Strengthen disclosure requirements Sebi could require companies to disclose more information on their ownership structures relatedparty transactions and tax liabilities Opaque practices designed to evade taxes vanish once they are exposed to light Improve monitoring of corporate actions Sebi could enhance its monitoring of corporate deals such as mergers and acquisitions to ensure that they are in the best interests of shareholders and do not involve any conflicts of interest Stricter or more enforceable rules on the appointment and removal of directors could also make a difference Tougher enforcement Sebi could take a more active approach to enforcing its regulations by conducting regular audits and inspections of listed companies It could also deploy harsher penalties for rule violators to deter business misconduct Enhance investor awareness and protection India s market regulator should educate investors better about their rights and responsibilities They need protection from fraudulent practices that only regulators can provide This programme could include steppedup investor grievance mechanisms mandatory investor education modules and strengthened whistleblower protections Better collaboration with other regulatory bodies Sebi should work more closely with other regulatory bodies such as the Reserve Bank of India and Union ministry of corporate affairs to share information and coordinate efforts aimed at combating financial fraud and misconduct In general Sebi should continue to strengthen its regulatory framework and preemptively enforce regulations to ensure that Indian markets for securities remains fair transparent

Narendra Modi was scared of my next speech on Adani  During a press meet on Saturday Gandhi insisted that there is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani and asked There is a question Rs 20000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani s shell companies where has this money come from Some of these companies are defence companies Whose money is being spent on our drone and missile development Why is the defence ministry not asking this question Though he did not elaborate Gandhi s reference to the specific figure of Rs 20000 crore resonates with two recent developments related to the group and data analysis on monies coming into the Adani Group Over half of Adani FDI came from opaque overseas entities  FT An analysis by Financial Times this month using publicly available financial data from India concluded that almost half of Adani s 57 billion foreign direct investment FDI inflows were from opaque overseas entities with connections to group  The Financial Times on analysing India s FDI remittance data reported that offshore companies linked to the Adanis and bearing funds of unclear provenance invested almost half of all the FDI that came into the Adani Group of companies This could be said to amount to Rs 20000 crore  the figure Gandhi mentioned in his press conference The Londonbased financial daily had also written in its report about the the role of hardtoscrutinise money flows in financing the Indian tycoon s business empire  It added that Adani had aligned himself with Prime Minister Narendra Modi s development agenda  The report had also stated that these offshore companies linked to the Adanis invested at least 26 billion in the group between 2017 and 2022 which was 454 of the more than 57 billion it received in total FDI over the period The analysis concluded that the total amount of opaque overseas investments in Adani companies was an underestimation and the actual value will be higher since official FDI numbers in India exclude foreign portfolio investments which fall under a different reporting regime  and also investments in listed companies amounting to less than 10 of their paidup capital Aborted Adani FPO Rs 20000 crore Adani Enterprises had raised Rs 20000 crore US25 billion through a fully subscribed followon public offer FPO in late January However as reported by The Wire it subsequently called off the FPO as it faced market volatility in the wake of allegations that the parent company Adani Group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud The Adani Group had then said in a statement Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility the company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction Forbes magazine has also reported on what it said was evidence the Adani Group likely bought into the 25 billion share sale The involvement of Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital  two entities that Hindenburg Research had alleged were linked to Adani  in the share sale raises questions about whether any of Adani s personal funds were deployed to help meet the 25 billion target  the business magazine wrote The only way Adani can actually resolve this issue is to illustrate who did buy all of the shares It would be my speculation that there were insiders the report had quoted Tim Buckley a former investment banker at Citigroup and director at Australiabased Climate Energy Finance who has been studying the Adani Group for over a decade as saying PM is scared of my next speech which is going to come on Adani During the press meet the Congress leader insisted that he has been targeted for raising uncomfortable questions about the saffron party s relationship with the corporate house Please understand why I have been disqualified I have been disqualified because the Prime Minister is scared of my next speech He is scared of the next speech that is going to come on Adani I have seen it in his eyes So he is terrified of the next speech that is going to come and they don t want that speech to be in Parliament That is the issue that is why first the distraction now the disqualification he said Following Gandhi s press conference BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad addressed the media on the issue where he said We don t have to defend Adani BJP never defends Adani but BJP doesn t target anyone either The BJP claimed that Gandhi has been disqualified in accordance with a Supreme Court ruling Prasad spoke about the international business

available financial data from India concluded that almost half of Adani s 57 billion foreign direct investment FDI inflows were from opaque overseas entities with connections to group  The Financial Times on analysing India s FDI remittance data reported that offshore companies linked to the Adanis and bearing funds of unclear provenance invested almost half of all the FDI that came into the Adani Group of companies This could be said to amount to Rs 20000 crore  the figure Gandhi mentioned in his press conference The Londonbased financial daily had also written in its report about the the role of hardtoscrutinise money flows in financing the Indian tycoon s business empire  It added that Adani had aligned himself with Prime Minister Narendra Modi s development agenda  The report had also stated that these offshore companies linked to the Adanis invested at least 26 billion in the group between 2017 and 2022 which was 454 of the more than 57 billion it received in total FDI over the period The analysis concluded that the total amount of opaque overseas investments in Adani companies was an underestimation and the actual value will be higher since official FDI numbers in India exclude foreign portfolio investments which fall under a different reporting regime  and also investments in listed companies amounting to less than 10 of their paidup capital Aborted Adani FPO Rs 20000 crore Adani Enterprises had raised Rs 20000 crore US25 billion through a fully subscribed followon public offer FPO in late January However as reported by The Wire it subsequently called off the FPO as it faced market volatility in the wake of allegations that the parent company Adani Group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud The Adani Group had then said in a statement Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility the company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction Forbes magazine has also reported on what it said was evidence the Adani Group likely bought into the 25 billion share sale The involvement of Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital  two entities that Hindenburg Research had alleged were linked to Adani  in the share sale raises questions about whether any of Adani s personal funds were deployed to help meet the 25 billion target  the business magazine wrote The only way Adani can actually resolve this issue is to illustrate who did buy all of the shares It would be my speculation that there were insiders the report had quoted Tim Buckley a former investment banker at Citigroup and director at Australiabased Climate Energy Finance who has been studying the Adani Group for over a decade as saying PM is scared of my next speech which is going to come on Adani During the press meet the Congress leader insisted that he has been targeted for raising uncomfortable questions about the saffron party s relationship with the corporate house Please understand why I have been disqualified I have been disqualified because the Prime Minister is scared of my next speech He is scared of the next speech that is going to come on Adani I have seen it in his eyes So he is terrified of the next speech that is going to come and they don t want that speech to be in Parliament That is the issue that is why first the distraction now the disqualification he said Following Gandhi s press conference BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad addressed the media on the issue where he said We don t have to defend Adani BJP never defends Adani but BJP doesn t target anyone either The BJP claimed that Gandhi has been disqualified in accordance with a Supreme Court ruling Prasad spoke about the international business deals the Adani group engaged in during the Congress rule from 2004 to 2014 and also about its investments in Congressruled states PM Modi or the Modi government are yet to reply in Parliament to the substance of the charge of Adani s proximity to them Adani has denied that his longstanding connection with the prime minister has led to preferential treatment,During a press meet on Saturday Gandhi insisted that there is a deep relationship between Narendra Modi ji and Mr Adani and asked There is a question Rs 20000 crore have suddenly arrived in Mr Adani s shell companies where has this money come fromWhy is the defence ministry not asking this question Though he did not elaborate Gandhi s reference to the specific figure of Rs 20000 crore resonates with two recent developments related to

longer that scared as what they were let us say in Feb and March The impact of Adani Group on the overall market should be limited,None,Adani Group stocks to go through a long phase of consolidation Sandip Sabharwal,The impact of Adani Group on the overall market should be limited because the base case was always that they are unlikely to default and if they are unlikely to default then for the rest of the market the contagion should be limited says Sandip Sabharwal  asksandipsabharwalcomIt is tough to say because when NASDAQ actually cracked a lot Indian IT stocks were relatively stable so does NASDAQ being stable actually indicate again an uptick in outsourcing I think there is a lag So my guess is that next one or two quarters will be quite tough for IT companies Now good news and good prices all of us know do not come together so at some point of time within these quarters we will get into buy zone for IT companies but at this point of time I would still like to focus on domestic focus companiesFor some it will be for others it will not be and in many of these cases like the signings yesterday these orders were already announced earlier and it is just that first an order is announced and then it is actually signed and then gets implemented so I think so we should not be doing double counting in some of these ordersBut that said overall it is a low volatility sort of sector in terms of performance but these are long gestation projects so for example many of the ship orders or frigate missile launch orders which were announced yesterday the delivery starts in 202627 etc and then goes on for a few years so it is not that everything is going to come now These are very long gestation projects and as such the revenue is spread outThe impact of Adani Group on the overall market should be limited because the base case was always that they are unlikely to default and if they are unlikely to default then for the rest of the market the contagion should be limited Now how the overall Adani Group will perform is something we need to see because stocks have fallen from the top but they are still not cheap because the rise was so abnormal that people think that because they are half the valuation they are cheap Most of them are still not cheap So I think they will need to go through a long phase of consolidationI would think all of them are good to buy now I would say risk reward is at worst case another 10 downside and potential upside of 25 over the next one year or so So I think risk reward is favourable These banks are well placed balance sheets are strong profit growth will be reasonableThat I cannot predict because I do not know what numbers will come out But I think many of the auto stocks got beaten down after the monsoon prediction that monsoons will be bad summers will be very hot and that might impact overall sentiment rural income inflation dynamics interest rates etcSo I think that is where the correction in many of these companies which are actually doing well started Now we have not had a hot summer till now and monsoon is still a question mark how that will be So I think those externalities are difficult to predict but valuation wise I think these companies have become more reasonable now and although consumer demand might be slow to recover but I think it will eventually recover and going into later part of this year we should see stronger growth So four wheelers autos I would still like to see and two wheelers I would still like to avoidI do not buy many of these banks but that does not mean that they cannot rise up further If the overall banking sector moves up then they might also move up but challenges are more on the operational side because this year we would have seen the best of the reduced writeoffs increase in margins etc All of that will not go through from next year onwards So I think the results and everything are not going to be as great as what people think it would beBecause of the fact that the credit one the credit growth has been strong it will moderate a bit but I think on the deposit side many of these PSU Banks the costing will go up substantially because they are losing market share in lowcost deposits and once the easy liquidity chase got over I think that will be the challenge So I think the impact of that we will need to see,So my guess is that next one or two quarters will be quite tough for IT companiesSo I think they will need to go through a long phase of consolidationI would think all of them are good to buy nowI would say risk reward is at worst case another 10 downside and potential upside of 25 over the next one year or soNow we have not had a hot summer till now and monsoon is still a question mark how that will beSo I think the impact of

Gandhi s democracy remarks,New Delhi Apr 5 PTI Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday accused the Congress leaders of insulting Rajya Sabha while Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge charged the government with not allowing the Opposition to speak as trading of barbs and protests by the two sides led to a washout of one more day of proceedings While the Opposition persisted with its demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the Adani issue the treasury benches pressed for an apology from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for democracy under attack remarks made in the UK Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar declined a point of order raised by Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge on March 13 in which he objected to a call by the BJP for Gandhi to come to the Upper House and apologise for insulting the Parliament drawing more protests from the Congress Leader of House Piyush Goyal without naming Gandhi had demanded an apology for the shameless way by which a senior leader of the opposition in a foreign country has attacked the democracy of India insulted the Parliament of India  Reading out his decision in the midst of slogan shouting by opposition members during the postlunch session the Chairman said Constitutional privilege of freedom of expression and immunity from any civil or criminal action to Members of Parliament calls for a high degree of care caution and accountability This unique freedom privilege comes with heavy obligations Breach of this privilege by engaging in reckless trading of allegations or free fall of information invectives and innuendos or setting afoot pernicious narratives entail serious consequences he added The sanctity of the temple of democracy cannot be permitted to be outraged as the privilege does not extend to engaging in demeaning parliament making disparaging observations tarnishing constitutional institutions or set afloat narratives premised on reckless allegations of untenable fact premise Dhankhar said After due consideration on the matter he said I am of the firm view that there can be no issue or individual beyond the purview of discussion in the Rajya Sabha and the same is exclusively subject to regulation by the House and the Chairman He said the two precedents relied upon by Kharge have no bearing on the issue being determined herein  Kharge had cited a ruling given by late V V Giri on June 19 1967 that a member of one House should not use the freedom of speech on the floor of the House to make allegations or charge against the members of the other House  The other one was made on March 17 1983 by the then ViceChairman in favour of L K Advani that stated Before referring to a member of the other House one has to exercise a lot of care and caution  Dhankhar said the authenticated record made available by Goyal bears out that his demand of apology on the overseas statements made by a senior leader of the opposition is factually premised and does not graduate to making allegation of a defamatory or incriminatory nature  In view of categorical and firm constitutional prescriptions I cannot persuade myself to sustain the point of order raised by the Hon ble Leader of the Opposition Shri Mallikarjun Kharge and the same is hereby declined the Chairman said In response the Opposition members intensified their sloganeering following which Dhankhar adjourned the House for the day Earlier when the Upper House reassembled at 2 pm after the first adjournment Reports of the Public Accounts Committee 202223 were laid on the table by Bhubaneswar Kalita BJP amid sloganeering by opposition members who have been demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee JPC probe into allegations against the Adani Group Afterward Dhankhar informed the House that he would give his decision on the point of order raised by Kharge last month even as the Congress leader demanded that he be given a chance to speak The Chairman indicated that he would give his decision on the point of order raised by Kharge and give the floor to the Leader of Opposition but the opposition members continued their sloganeering However under the insistence of the opposition members the Chairman gave the floor to Kharge drawing protest from the treasury bench Kharge said he has been making efforts since morning under rule 267 to raise a few issues in the House but in vain and reiterated that a JPC probe must be conducted on the Adani issue Goyal however intervened and alleged that the Leader of the Opposition was trying to establish an unfounded matter which is not related to the Upper House and Kharge had no interest in the Chairman s decision on his point of order The real situation is this that they have defamed all the institutions of the country the House and the Chair and he Kharge has also to apologise and his leader who also defamed all the institutions of the country both at home and abroad be it judiciary the House or the Election Commission must apologise Goyal asserted He condemned the pressure tactics of the Congress and said the Leader of Opposition should stop insulting the House Kharge retorted saying he raised all the issues under established rules but the government is not allowing the Opposition to speak Earlier in the day minutes after the House convened for the day it was adjourned till 2 pm as opposition MPs raised slogans demanding a JPC probe into fraud allegations against the Adani Group As the House met for the day Kharge stood up to speak and was supported by MPs of other opposition parties However Dhankhar asked them to wait till the listed papers were laid on the table of the House As the papers were tabled the sloganeering by several opposition MPs continued The sloganeering intensified as the chairman said he had received a notice from Kharge under Rule 267 of Rajya Sabha for suspension of the scheduled business of the day As Dhankhar was reading the notice AAP s Sanjay Singh entered the Well of the House while raising slogans Some Congress MPs joined him Several Congress MPs were dressed in black as a mark of protest against the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Lok Sabha Dhankhar warned Singh that he would be named Amid the din the Chairman then adjourned the proceedings till 2 pm Adani Group stocks took a beating on the bourses after USbased activist shortseller Hindenburg Research

TMC MPs had distanced themselves from the Congressled agitation in Parliament for a JPC on the AdaniHindenburg issue Sukhendu Sekhar Ray TMC chief whip,None,Sharad Pawars response on Adani issue stirs opposition pot triggers whispers in Congress on electoral resonance,NCP chief Sharad Pawar s rejoinder to the Congress demand for a JPC on the Adani issue not only advertised the differences NCP has with ally Congress it also coincided with differences within the Opposition ranks including scepticism within the Congress on whether the issue on which Rahul Gandhi and therefore the Congress leaderships has chosen to focus fully has politicalelectoral resonance with the masses or whether the Adani matter  despite vital issues raised by the Hindenburg report  risks the same fate as Gandhis pre2019 LS poll fixation with the Rafale deal that had failed to fire up voters imagination and helped the regime to divert electoral focus away from many incumbency issuesPawars stand against the JPC and his pitch for the Opposition focusing on bread and butter issues of the people to counter the Modi regime has the potential to tap the sentiments of some Opposition parties when the Congress leadership is preparing to host them for united moves Many have noticed Pawars stand against JPC has brought him on the same page with TMC supremo and his longterm ally Mamata Banerjee  The TMC MPs had distanced themselves from the Congressled agitation in Parliament for a JPC on the AdaniHindenburg issueSukhendu Sekhar Ray TMC chief whip in the RS and national spokesperson told ET Mr Sharad Pawar a very experienced and senior leader has expressed his views on the Adani issue The TMC has always been for a Supreme Courtmonitored investigation into the AdaniHindenburg matter The fact that the SC has constituted a committee of experts to probe the Hindenburg revelations and also suggest ways to prevent recurrence of such issues showed the apex court found prima facie merit in the demand for a probe As everybody has faith in the Supreme Court there cant be any grounds to doubt the SCmonitored probe We would like to see an early completion of the probe and submission of the findingsOn his party not preferring a JPC on the matter Ray said There is nothing wrong per say in demanding a JPC probe but the fact is past JPC probes into Harshad Mehta Ketan Parekh stocks scams and the 2G issues failed to produce anything concrete That is why the TMC demanded a SCmonitored probe and didnt join the Congress and others agitation for a JPC Rahul Gandhi had every right as an MP to speak in the House on the Adani issue but the treasury benches did the most unacceptable act of taking the lead in disrupting the entire session so that the Houses could not discuss the budget and many issues that concerned the peopleSharad Pawars stand on the Adani issue also came close on the heels of his earlier intervention to caution Rahul Gandhi about his comments on Savarkar that had angered Shiv Sena UBT The Sena has now showed understanding of Pawars stand Right from the beginning Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjees party were not for the JPC probe into the Adani issue As an experienced administrator Pawar sahab always has a liberal view on industrialists and we understand that For the Shiv Sena Adani issue is important Rahul Ji played a big role in taking it to the people For Shiv Sena equally important are issues such as unemployment inflation and Centres witchhunt against Opposition leadersWhether all those 16 Opposition parties who protested along with the Congress in Parliament on Adani issue and for the JPC issues will stay the course is now a matter of suspenseWithin the Congress some leaders privately feel their leadership should alongside the Adani issue tactically broadbase the campaign against the Modi regime by showcasing economic issues that have hit ordinary people They see in PM Modis daily harping against corruption him erecting a counter to the Adani issue and against Opposition leaders as his fourth plank alongside the leadershipdevelopmentHindutvanationalist quartetThe main reasons why Rahul jis campaign against the Rafale deal and his Chowkidar chor hai slogan didnt work in the election is because it was more about procedural issues than evidence of kickback Also PM Modis popularity rating was too high to be breached with the Rafael plank Now the Adani matter raises serious issues of crony capitalism and regulators functioning but whether the issue has a direct connect with the masses who vote and whether it alone can be effective in denting the PMs standing and his own positioning as a crusader against corruption is a matter of debate many among us a senior Congress MP said privately,Many have noticed Pawars stand against JPC has brought him on the same page with TMC supremo and his longterm ally Mamata Banerjee That is why the TMC demanded a SCmonitored probe and didnt join the Congress and others agitation for a JPCThe Sena has now showed understanding of Pawars stand Right from the beginning Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjees party were not for the JPC probe into the Adani issueFor the Shiv Sena Adani

TMC MPs had distanced themselves from the Congressled agitation in Parliament for a JPC on the AdaniHindenburg issue Sukhendu Sekhar Ray TMC chief whip,None,Sharad Pawars response on Adani issue stirs opposition pot triggers whispers in Congress on electoral resonance,NCP chief Sharad Pawar s rejoinder to the Congress demand for a JPC on the Adani issue not only advertised the differences NCP has with ally Congress it also coincided with differences within the Opposition ranks including scepticism within the Congress on whether the issue on which Rahul Gandhi and therefore the Congress leaderships has chosen to focus fully has politicalelectoral resonance with the masses or whether the Adani matter  despite vital issues raised by the Hindenburg report  risks the same fate as Gandhis pre2019 LS poll fixation with the Rafale deal that had failed to fire up voters imagination and helped the regime to divert electoral focus away from many incumbency issuesPawars stand against the JPC and his pitch for the Opposition focusing on bread and butter issues of the people to counter the Modi regime has the potential to tap the sentiments of some Opposition parties when the Congress leadership is preparing to host them for united moves Many have noticed Pawars stand against JPC has brought him on the same page with TMC supremo and his longterm ally Mamata Banerjee  The TMC MPs had distanced themselves from the Congressled agitation in Parliament for a JPC on the AdaniHindenburg issueSukhendu Sekhar Ray TMC chief whip in the RS and national spokesperson told ET Mr Sharad Pawar a very experienced and senior leader has expressed his views on the Adani issue The TMC has always been for a Supreme Courtmonitored investigation into the AdaniHindenburg matter The fact that the SC has constituted a committee of experts to probe the Hindenburg revelations and also suggest ways to prevent recurrence of such issues showed the apex court found prima facie merit in the demand for a probe As everybody has faith in the Supreme Court there cant be any grounds to doubt the SCmonitored probe We would like to see an early completion of the probe and submission of the findingsOn his party not preferring a JPC on the matter Ray said There is nothing wrong per say in demanding a JPC probe but the fact is past JPC probes into Harshad Mehta Ketan Parekh stocks scams and the 2G issues failed to produce anything concrete That is why the TMC demanded a SCmonitored probe and didnt join the Congress and others agitation for a JPC Rahul Gandhi had every right as an MP to speak in the House on the Adani issue but the treasury benches did the most unacceptable act of taking the lead in disrupting the entire session so that the Houses could not discuss the budget and many issues that concerned the peopleSharad Pawars stand on the Adani issue also came close on the heels of his earlier intervention to caution Rahul Gandhi about his comments on Savarkar that had angered Shiv Sena UBT The Sena has now showed understanding of Pawars stand Right from the beginning Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjees party were not for the JPC probe into the Adani issue As an experienced administrator Pawar sahab always has a liberal view on industrialists and we understand that For the Shiv Sena Adani issue is important Rahul Ji played a big role in taking it to the people For Shiv Sena equally important are issues such as unemployment inflation and Centres witchhunt against Opposition leadersWhether all those 16 Opposition parties who protested along with the Congress in Parliament on Adani issue and for the JPC issues will stay the course is now a matter of suspenseWithin the Congress some leaders privately feel their leadership should alongside the Adani issue tactically broadbase the campaign against the Modi regime by showcasing economic issues that have hit ordinary people They see in PM Modis daily harping against corruption him erecting a counter to the Adani issue and against Opposition leaders as his fourth plank alongside the leadershipdevelopmentHindutvanationalist quartetThe main reasons why Rahul jis campaign against the Rafale deal and his Chowkidar chor hai slogan didnt work in the election is because it was more about procedural issues than evidence of kickback Also PM Modis popularity rating was too high to be breached with the Rafael plank Now the Adani matter raises serious issues of crony capitalism and regulators functioning but whether the issue has a direct connect with the masses who vote and whether it alone can be effective in denting the PMs standing and his own positioning as a crusader against corruption is a matter of debate many among us a senior Congress MP said privately,Many have noticed Pawars stand against JPC has brought him on the same page with TMC supremo and his longterm ally Mamata Banerjee That is why the TMC demanded a SCmonitored probe and didnt join the Congress and others agitation

which the Narendra Modi government went to shield Gautam Adani,None,Government stalls House only to avoid one question on Adani,Shouldn t we ask how Adani made Rs 12 lakh crore in twoandahalf years Money is taken from LIC SBI and other banks to buy national assets Parliament was adjourned sine die on Thursday following incessant protests that pressed the JPC demand and the BJPs insistence that Rahul Gandhi apologise for his remark in the UK that democracy was in peril in India The joint Opposition on Thursday wondered what desperation lay behind the extent to which the Narendra Modi government went to shield Gautam Adani preferring the washout of a Parliament session to a discussion or a joint parliamentary committee probe into the allegations against his business house Laying the blame for the washout at the government s door 20 Opposition parties stuck to their position that Parliament wasn t allowed to function only because Modi wanted to avoid the Adani issue The Opposition parties boycotted the customary tea hosted by the Lok Sabha Speaker on the last day of the session and held a protest march with the national flag The leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said I never saw in my 50year legislative career that the government did not allow both the Houses to run only to avoid one question Why is Adani given such importance Shouldn t we ask how Adani made Rs 12 lakh crore in twoandahalf years Money is taken from LIC SBI and other banks to buy national assets Kharge added With the nation s resources the nation s assets are being bought by a businessman Ports airports infrastructure electricity rail nothing is spared Why has the government facilitated this transfer As if there was an agenda to make one man rich by any means Why can t Rahul Gandhi s questions be answered How did the Prime Minister help Adani get contracts in so many countries Shouldn t these issues be debated Contending that a JPC probe would bring out the reality in a transparent manner Kharge said Our questions were about scandals about loot about money laundering through shell companies and they were shouting about Rahul Gandhi saying something in London The two issues had no connection It is clear there is a kind of nexus between the Prime Minister and Adani that they didn t want to expose The session which saw the removal of the main Opposition voice from the Lok Sabha witnessed the budget being passed amid din without any discussion The Opposition demonstrated exceptional grit by staying united on floor strategy and resolving to work on a larger political coalition as well Kharge is expected to call a meeting of the presidents of all Opposition parties soon On Rahul s ouster Kharge said A Gujarat MP who assaulted a Dalit doctor and was convicted by a court is protected from disqualification But Rahul Gandhi is falsely accused of insulting the OBCs and disqualified in a day Is this justice Rules will be applied selectively I congratulate all Opposition parties for staying united But the government did not pay heed to the united voice of the Opposition Is this democracy Is this how Parliament is run And if somebody says democracy is in peril he is attacked Warning against the drift towards dictatorship Kharge said democracy would not survive if the government acted in this manner Representatives of 20 Opposition parties were present at the media conference with Kharge DMK leader TR Baalu said The BJP is jittery after the success of the Bharat Jodo Yatra They are scared of Rahul Gandhi and that s why they conspired to throw him out of Parliament First time I am seeing a ruling party disturb Parliament But we will fight unitedly K Keshava Rao of the BRS which nurtures a strident antiCongress agenda said You see all the political parties that had differences and maintained a distance Now you see us together we are becoming so strong All the efforts to divide us have failed We are on the same page and trying to evolve a common programme He argued that leadership wasn t a hurdle at this stage The Aam Aadmi Party s Sanjay Singh detailed how Modi had helped Adani and was now refusing to order an investigation The parties present included the NCP DMK JDU Trinamul Congress RJD Shiv Sena CPI CPM BRS AAP SP IUML NC RSP RLD JMM Kerala Congress MDMK and the VCK besides the Congress,Laying

misunderstanding in the market and with other media and has become a political issue we are compelled to share this information publicly at this time That is regrettable but could have been avoided by your reporters taking a careful and objective approach It added Our statement to your reporter that all the transactions about which the Financial Times inquired have been publicly disclosed is

the damning Hindenburg report on the Adani Group  Rahul Gandhi along with the opposition has kept a sustained focus on the issue to ringfence the government accusing it of extending undue benefits to the industrialist Gautam Adani But now with Sharad Pawar and Ghulam Nabi Azad speaking out are the tables being turned on Rahul GandhiFormer Congress veteran Azad who quit the party last year after blaming Rahul Gandhi for lack of leadership skills spilled the beans on him yesterday in an interview The entire family has associations with businessmen including him Rahul I can give 10 examples of where he would go even outside the country to meet people who are undesirable businessmen said Azad in an interview to Malayalam news channel Asianet News Azad was replying to Rahuls tweet in which he had accused Azad of having ties with Gautam AdaniFormer JK CM and exUnion minister Azad had severed his fivedecade association with Congress in August last year and floated his own party Democratic Progressive Azad PartyIn a tweet on Saturday Rahul had linked with Adani four exCongress leaders who are now in the BJP Jyotiraditya Scindia Kiran Reddy Himanta Biswa Sarma and Anil Antony along with AzadAzads reply to Rahul is expected to put Rahul on back foot as the BJP can now use Azads criticism of Rahul to quiz him on his ties with various businesspersons abroad especially when Rahul is known for spending considerable time abroadAzads hitting back at Rahul fits into what seems to be the BJPs larger plan to discredit Rahul who is adamant on a probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee JPC into the Hindenburg issue  not satisfied by a Supreme Courtordered probeJust before Azad questioned Rahul opposition stalwart Sharad Pawar had ticked off Rahul by defending Adani Pawar also said there was no need for a JPC probe On top of that Pawar later also spoke out on the degree issue differing with many opposition leaders who are trying to corner Modi over his educational degree which they claim is fake Pawar said the educational degree of someone cant be a political issuePawar has clearly distanced from Rahuls attacks on the Modi government in an ample indication that the supposed opposition unity against Modi is splintering well before it could crystallize into any concrete electoral frontBefore these two statements that go to defend Modi Pawar had distanced himself from Rahuls criticism of Hindutva icon VD Savarkar Just when Rahul had sharpened his attack on Savarkar Pawar came out with a statement praising Savarkar He said Savarkar was a progressive leader who had built a temple and assigned its upkeep to the Dalit community He also said that the controversy over Rahuls comments on Savrakar was distracting people from other serious issues on which the opposition can corner the Modi government Pawars nephew Ajit Pawar too came out with statements that cracked the opposition unity over the Adani issue He also spoke against another perennial issue raised by opposition leaders the alleged manipulation of EVMs by the BJP to win polls He said he had no problem with EVMs which cant be tampered withWith Pawar distancing from Rahul and other opposition leaders attacking the Modi government on Adani Rahul who has been the most vocal against the Modi government among opposition leaders might get isolatedAnd with Azad hitting back at Rahul now there is also a chance of Rahul facing fire from the socalled G23 group of veteran Congress leaders who are not happy with the way Rahul is running the party Criticism from veteran party insiders will be embarrassing for Rahul especially if they try to softpedal the Adani issueWith his Bharat Jodo Yatra Rahul had aimed to not only revive his party but also to emerge as an aggressive leader who could fearlessly take on the Modi government and thus perhaps the leader of a possible opposition front against the BJP in the runup to the Lok Sabha elections next yearBut now it seems Rahuls favourite Adani issue could boomerang on him With Pawar one of the most important opposition leaders and also an alliance partner of the Congress distancing from Rahul on the Adani issue and now Azad

likely to remain elevated for the next couple of months Pet coke prices may also continue to rise However strong demand in the cement sector may wipe off the negatives of rising prices Cement manufacturing companies are expected to do well for the next few years on the back of better demand prospects led by infrastructure and housing sectors heightened industry consolidation and regulatory

for some time and rally some more because of the tailwinds they enjoy However investors should be equally careful Stocks hitting 52week highs may or may not be trading at expensive valuations Also the bright prospects driving the rally for the moment may soon drizzle out when the market sentiment changes for the worse In that case these stocks are no longer attractive In conclusion rather than focusing more on the price action your ultimate focus should be on the fundamentals and valuations DisclaimerThis article is for information purposes only It is not a stock recommendation and should

Adani bulls who have been enjoying the oneway rally that defied gravity and all valuation metrics in the last few years Adani Enterprises FPO opens today Shares are below FPO floor price and stocks are under pressure So what should retail investors currently do if they are holding the group stocks IIFL Securities director Sanjiv Bhasin shares investment advice Listenin It is the investor s choice We will not try and influence that We definitely think there is merit in the group and we think the longer term prospects remain very robust One cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt I would definitely advocate a buy at least in the FPO and I would say Ambuja and the ports are looking very attractive at this price says DirectorWell that is a million dollar question One report from five analysts who I have never heard of Hindenburg comes and upsets the market They come on the expiry day and tell them that they are short It is all concerted Whatever the outcome it tells us how insider trading is very open right now In fact SEBI and stock exchanges should look to who had initiated this and where was the call writing and put and hence the option marketOn Wednesday out of a turnover of Rs 400 lakh crore Rs 300 lakh crore was just the option But on a more neutral note the group has very good assets and there is no sovereign risk over here LIC  the other banks which I see no problem with There is always going to be uncertainty when a group has made its market cap past Rs 20 lakh crore in the last five years but it is on the back of businesses which are there So the debate is openIn a global context India has underperformed this month and now is time to put your money where your mouth is I do not see any changes coming on the LTCG on the negative side and if anything there can be more proponents on capex and other things because the government is sitting on a much better balance sheet than before I would say this is the lull before the storm of buying what you want because what the money had to go to China has already gone I would definitely give Adani a subscribe over here A disclosure we have no holdings in AdaniLook at the top gainers  Bajaj Auto Tata Motors  Mahindra  Mahindra Hero The numbers from the auto side are excellent When an economy turns the first two sectors to turn are cement and auto and there are no two ways I think Ambuja is a steal at this priceAside from that the holding company Adani Enterprise and Adani Ports Adani Ports would be arguably the third best port in the world So ignoring the corporate issues and the debt we all know there are no such hidden things Every six months something comes up like that and one can see the prerogative is the derailing the FPOThere are pros and cons but this is very well orchestrated where the option side is telling you that insiders had already taken position and perpetrated its report The outcome of that is the market for you But I definitely think cement autos are telling you that the economy has turned and if anything the Budget could be a trend setter and this is a very good time to buy select stocks definitelyWhere have you seen 30 falls in two days Now whether it is perpetrated or not there are sovereign funds there are enough people who have committed to the FPO So it is a needle where you have to see whether you can ignore the noise and put your money in something which is giving you value but it is the investor s choice We will not try and influence that We definitely think there is merit in the group and we think the longer term prospects remain very robust You cannot have growth of the type of growth in infrastructure which they have done without debt Also I think all their businesses are in fine shape I would definitely advocate a buy at least in the FPO and I would say Ambuja and the ports are looking very attractive at this priceDisclaimer Recommendations suggestions

returns on single deposit  SBI monthly income scheme calculator interest rate 2023,SBI Monthly Income Scheme 2023 The reports of mass layoffs by several firms in various multinational and Indian companies have created an atmosphere of uncertainty among people The situation is even more worrying for those who have only a single source of income Hence amid these times of volatility people are in search of lucrative investment plans that can guarantee them a regular and a fixed monthly income Most of the people are aware of the post office monthly income scheme which recently revised the interest rates for the scheme from January 2023 The investors are now getting 71 per cent per annum payable monthly However today we will discuss another monthly income scheme provided by the largest public sector bank State Bank of India SBI One such investment plan offered by SBI is the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme which offers guaranteed returns providing investors with assurance and the peace of mind they deserve Understanding SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme In the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme investors have to deposit onetime lump sum amount After investment investors receive repayment of the same in monthly annuity installment comprising part of the principal amount plus interest on the reducing principal amount compounded at quarterly rests and discounted to the monthly value In simpler terms SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme allows investors to receive a predetermined monthly amount in return for their initial deposit in Equated Monthly Instalments EMIs So it works on the concept of a loan Bank provides you the loan where you repay it along with the interest on the loan in EMIs Similarly in an annuity deposit scheme you give a certain amount to the bank and it repays you with interest on the invested amount SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme Duration of the investment scheme Customers of SBI can take advantage of the SBI Annuity Deposit scheme for a deposit period of 3 5 7 and 10 years The scheme is available at all branches of the SBI SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme Eligibility All resident individuals including minors can invest in the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme while the mode of holding can be done singly or jointly SBI Annuity Deposit scheme Rules for Premature closure The bank allows the premature closure for the SBI Annuity scheme depositors in case of death of the subscriber Premature payment is also allowed for deposits up to Rs 15 lakh however penalty is chargeable as applicable to Term Deposits SBI Annuity Deposit scheme Facility for Loan The scheme allows an overdraft or loan up to 75 of the annuity balance in certain circumstances SBI Annuity Deposit scheme Tax Interest on SBI Annuity Deposits scheme is subject to TDS SBI Annuity Deposit scheme Maturity amount In the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme investors receive repayment of their invested amount in monthly annuity installment comprising part of the principal amount plus interest on the reducing principal amount So the maturity amount is zero SBI Annuity Deposit scheme Interest rates The interest rates provided on the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme are as applicable to term deposits chosen by the account holder SBI interest rates on Annuity Deposit scheme SBI Annuity Deposit scheme Payment date to customers by bank Investors will start receiving the returns starting the first months anniversary if the date 29th 30th or 31st is nonexistent the lender will make the repayment on the first day of the following month Annuity deposit scheme vs Fixed Deposit In Fixed Deposit account customers make one time Deposit and receive the maturity amount at maturity date which comprises principal and interest Annuity Deposit accepts one time Deposit and amount is repaid to the customer over the predecided tenure selected by the investor along with interest in equated monthly installments In FD the investors principal amount remains intact which is repaid after maturity however in SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme

SwarajyaMag,,,https://swarajyamag.com/business/hindenburg-adani-row-more-than-meets-the-eye,,None,HindenburgAdani Row More Than Meets The Eye,The Hindenburg episode has left mixed outcomes both for the nation as well as for Adani Group It left behind some serious lessons for India on the potential risks in a globalised financial world At the same time there are more questions than answers on the motives behind the bear operation and its potential gainers Adani Group deserves applause for a full subscription to the nowcancelled Rs 20000 crore 243 billion at current exchange followon public offer FPO of Adani Enterprises It reassured foreign institutional investors about the strength of the Indian market Failure of the issue could have triggered a pullout by FIIs leading to bloodshed in the market and serious hurdles to the Indian growth story That explains why some quarters were unhappy to see that the issue sailed through Having said that Adani Group deserves criticism for its poor if not arrogant public messaging for nearly a week from the publication of the Hindenburg report on 24 January to the cancellation of the FPO on 1 February It was not the content of the argument but the tone of it which made all the difference The company forgot that they were dealing with investor sentiment Chestthumping and raking up national interest issues didn t suit the occasion The communication disaster was finally corrected by group chairman Gautam Adani s sober messaging Unfortunately by that time the damage was done More To It In 1957 Indian diplomat V K Krishna Menon spoke for a record eight hours at the United Nations defending India s territorial rights over Kashmir He tried to impress upon the audience that the Indian position was beyond doubt Former Union minister Natwar Singh remarked in his book that many in the audience wondered why if the issue was so simple did it take so long to explain It is a matter of debate whether Adani s 413page counter to Hindenburg Research LLC helped soothe nerves in the stock market Having said that there is little doubt that the importance of the debate raked up by Hindenburg lies in its timing rather than the content The valuation debate is not new to Adani stocks Compared with Gujarat Gas the priceearning multiple of Adani Total will make heads spin Screener the stock analysis and screening tool flags that despite the correction the stock is traded 66 times its book value Adani Enterprises serves multiple purposes apart from trading It is the holding company of the group and incubator for new businesses which are yet to establish steady revenue streams A mismatch between the trading volume and delivery has been a known issue with this stock In the market higher delivery is indicative of investor buying Low delivery normally stems from low float and signifies the play of traders who square off deals during the day for opportunistic gains Such trade gives buoyancy to the stock On the flipside quick profitbooking by traders let Adani Enterprises share bleed over the last 10odd days Investors are backing the stock According to a media report quoting Ace Equity as on 2 February the sixday average deliverable volume declined to 1779 per cent from 2521 per cent during 1724 January Notably Adani wanted to correct this mismatch by taking more shares to longterm investors who don t participate in daytrade through the FPO The big question is Who gained from its cancellation The group has a huge array of hard assets With the Indian economy fully recovered from the pandemic impacts and is the fastestgrowing among its peers the cash boxes of Adani s ports airports power generation and distribution business coal mines cement and so on will keep ringing Who Gains Here is a group that operates in scale and controls the entire value chain in the businesses they are present Take coal for example From mines in India and abroad exportimport trade shipping to user industry  they are everywhere Adani focused on infrastructure and built a huge empire during the United Progressive Alliance UPA era The infrastructure focus of the Narendra Modi government helped them scale greater heights They are just too big to fail and the decline in share value has nothing to do with business prospects Having said that the Hindenburg episode may leave some peripheral impacts The cancellation of the FPO and anticipated shelving of the 500 million overseas bond issue plan will delay the declared goals to repay part of the loans The decline in market capitalisation coupled with the downgrading of the collateral value of Adani s bonds might hold the group from throwing its hats into new capitalintensive areas This is however a temporary impact Analysts expect the spell to be over in six months to one year During this period Adani might prioritise its spending to earn a breather The question is which are those areas and whether they have any implications for the future plans of the group The market is abuzz that Adani might slow down on its promised 50 billion foray in green hydrogen which was potent to create a storm in India s highly competitive energy sector The future will tell us which way Adani takes but it s hard to believe that one short seller in some faraway land can launch such a precision attack and have ramifications on the national economy and business space A short seller offers to sell shares without owning them They expect to buy the shares at a lower value to complete the deal at a later date Such naked short selling is not allowed in India but is legal in the United States US Hindenburg took short positions in Adani Group companies through UStraded bonds and global receipt and they declared it Was it enough to cause such damage Normally any bull or bear operation happens in a networked fashion and no one in the Indian market is ready to believe that it s a simple case of an activistinvestor taking on Adani or India all alone It is up to the country to find answers It is not known whether the answers will ever reach the public domain But for now the Hindenburg story seems too good to be true There is surely more than meets the eye From that perspective the bloodshed in Adani stocks is a minor incident The design might be far more vicious than it seems as an ace lawyer and exSolicitor General of India Harish Salve has claimed,The Hindenburg episode has left mixed outcomes both for the nation as well as for Adani GroupAdani Group deserves applause for a full subscription to the nowcancelled Rs 20000 crore 243

SwarajyaMag,,,https://swarajyamag.com/business/what-explains-adani-groups-u-turn-on-the-fpo,,None,What Explains Adani Group s UTurn On The FPO,The Adani Group s Rs 20000 crore followon public offer FPO was in jeopardy after the Hindenburg report was released just prior to the IPO As a result not only did the shares fall by 30 per cent but the offer which opened on 25 January only saw a three per cent subscription by 30 January Even after Adani s reply to the Hindenburg report investors appeared unconvinced After Adani s response to Hindenburg s allegations Hindenburg said the company had only confirmed its key points while not clarifying on some of the important issues However Hindenburg is incentivised to criticise companies and managements hence reading too much into its opinions wouldn t offer a balanced picture The Adani Group refused to reduce the offer price for FPO An Abu Dhabibased fund IHC said that it would be investing 400 million in the FPO It appeared that the decision was correct since on the last day the FPO was fully subscribed by investors After the FPO was fully subscribed the company said it would be wrong to accept investor money at a premium to the current stock price and returned the money to investors After the latenight announcement the group s shares fell further during the morning session on Thursday 2 February Why Did The Company Accept Funds Only To Return Them One possible explanation is that the company expected share prices to rise once again after their reply to the Hindenburg report and expected to regain investors faith Hence it decided to continue the FPO without reducing prices However since share prices still continued to be lower the group didn t go ahead with the FPO and returned investor money According to an article by Forbes  there are specific facts that point towards allies helping the group complete its FPO On the other hand given the lacklustre response the FPO had received until the last day it is also possible that the FPO was subscribed by the group to prevent a loss of face since the FPO was the largest in India A singledigit subscription in the FPO by external investors might have signalled to the group that it needed to step in to prevent the FPO from becoming a failure It would also allow the company to show that it cares about investors while displaying its ability to raise money even during tough times Debt Investors Growing Worries A part of the FPO money was to be invested in new projects while another part was to be used to repay debt Given that the group has a strong focus on infrastructure projects it is necessary for it to take up debt to fund the projects Investors in the US who trade Adani bonds appear to be selling heavily The bonds values have fallen to 69 cents on the dollar or lower These bonds had rallied after the completion of the FPO but fell back lower after the decision to return FPO funds to investors These distress levels are usually seen when investors believe that there could be a major impact on the business The group s leverage has been an oftdiscussed topic in recent months and the FPO issue appears to have made debt investors cautious According to reports Credit Suisse s private banking arm has stopped accepting the bonds of some Adani Group companies Further it is reported that the Reserve Bank of India is asking banks for details about their exposure to the Adani group After the report came out the Hindenburg group hasn t spoken about how exactly it went short on the bonds and other securities of the Adani group Other shortsellers who know the group too have been confused about how Hindenburg exactly bet on the group Is This The End Or The Beginning Of The Group s Problems The debacle is a departure from the continuous successes that the group has achieved over the last few years It had entered several new businesses with large investments and the group received constant media attention Despite the allegations if Adani group can make its infrastructure projects and acquisitions viable to pay debt and generate money for shareholders these allegations wouldn t mean much But perception often shapes reality and if banks media and investors are sceptical of the group it might only make life tougher As the FPO episode showed raising money from the public can be a difficult task even if the stock has been one of the best wealth creators in years Further regulatory bodies are reportedly stepping up their scrutiny of the group after the Hindenburg report went public while the opposition is stepping up its criticism of the business group It would serve the group well to reduce its focus on growth at all costs to focusing on profitability and corporate governance to win investor trust back This article was first published here,The Adani Group s Rs 20000 crore followon public offer FPO was in jeopardy after the Hindenburg report was released just prior to the IPOEven after Adani s

SwarajyaMag,,,https://swarajyamag.com/business/why-adani-should-thank-hindenburg-he-can-now-focus-on-the-right-things,,None,Why Adani Should Thank Hindenburg He Can Now Focus On The Right Things,Gautam Adani the man whose portstoFMCG conglomerate is at the centre of a storm raised by a Hindenburg report alleging fraud and other illegalities has taken the first step towards redeeming his reputation by choosing to return the money raised by Adani Enterprises in the recent Rs 20000 crore FPO followon public offer It is possible that he got those investments from institutions and business houses on the promise that if the share price crashes they would be compensated Or maybe the purpose of showing full subscription was to enable Adani to exit the FPO on a moral high He can now claim that he could raise large amounts of money despite all the adverse comments in the media and the crash in the group s shares But whatever the truth this is the right way to go In many ways Adani should be thanking Hindenburg for the crash in his shares because credibility cannot be built on sand  the sands of fickle stock market valuations The media was focused on his alleged status as one of the world s richest men forgetting the fact that all this wealth is paper wealth that can go up in smoke in a jiffy Also he now does not have the option of funding his ambitions based on overvalued shares This will help him focus on his businesses rather than the surroundsound of wealth and fraud which is what he needs to reckon with While the regulators and probe agencies must indeed start looking at any transgressions of the law Adani himself needs a lasersharp focus on only one thing establishing the viability of his various businesses which include not only ports but also power green energy FMGC cement and media the last two being recent acquisitions funded largely through debt Barring media where profitability is always dicey most of his other businesses are probably inherently bankable but blighted by excess debt and unsustainable valuations The route to reestablishing his credibility with investors is by reducing his debt levels improving cash flows and profitability and thus enabling investors to come back with renewed belief One of the first things ambitious businessmen must learn is to stay away from the media It is no coincidence that Adani s own downfall was preceded by an India Today cover that crowned him Newsmaker of The Year 2022 and called him a Growth King In 2013 India Today had done another cover story on four Growth Kings listing Dhirubhai Ambani the GM Modi group the Nandas of Escorts and Vijay Mallya as these four Barring Dhirubhai s son Mukesh Ambani the rest are nowhere in the big leagues today And even in the case of Ambani the second son has not achieved the level of success that comes with the name Mukesh himself must proceed on the assumption that Reliance s success is not forever Gautam Adani would do well to read Phil Rosenzweig s 2007 book The Halo Effect  where the author points out that the mere fact of apparent success  high share prices or high profits  are often used to deduce that there must be a high quality management underlying that success In fact media tends to latch on to business icons only after the success is already visible to everyone and when they put someone in their cover stories they are essentially recognising something that is probably past its peak The same applies to stock market recommendations If a broker says something is worth buying it implies that he has already done so and wants you to follow suit so that he looks prophetic The lesson for all businessmen is clear avoid the media keep your heads down keep debt down grow quietly and focus on the business not publicity One of Rosenzweig s pet ideas is that books like In Search of Excellence and Built To Last which claimed to show the key elements of permanent or longterm business success tend to err in terms of causality They connect the dots from outcome to causes postfacto which can be dead wrong Correlation is not causality In the years after these books were published most of the companies shown as great have faltered This is not to suggest that Adani s best days are over but it is best if he believes so and brings focus back to his business and emphasises corporate governance The probability is that many of his businesses are good in themselves for now but they need careful execution and consistent effort  and some luck The operative phrase in the previous sentence is for now  Rosenzweig s conclusion is that business success cannot last forever  Just as all humans must come to terms with their own ultimate mortality so too must businesses Adani s run of good luck ran out a week ago when Hindenburg decided that his balloon needed to be pricked It is an ideal opportunity for Adani to prove the doomsayers wrong,Or maybe the purpose of showing full subscription was to enable Adani to exit the FPO on a moral highIn many ways Adani should be thanking Hindenburg for the crash in his shares because credibility cannot be built on sand  the sands of fickle stock market valuationsThis will help him focus on his businesses rather than the surroundsound of wealth and fraud which is what he needs to reckon withRosenzweig s conclusion is that business success cannot last forever Adani

allegations,The timing could not have been worse for Gautam Adanis 20000 crore followon public offer FPO which came at a time when investors were offloading their positions in the groups seven listed stocks extensively It was a bloodbath on Friday with Adani stocks hitting lower circuits and some of them even witnessing a doubledigit decline The reason behind the free fall in Adani stocks would be Hindenburg Researchs allegations over the Group However Adani has fought back by giving a much clear picture of its business portfolio On Friday Adani Transmission Adani Green Energy and Adani Total Gas closed at 20 lower circuits each While Adani Power and Adani Wilmar hit 5 lower circuits each Adani Ports wasnt performing any better and tumbled by over 16 at the end of the day Meanwhile Adanis flagship company Adani Enterprises which launched its FPO on Friday nosedived by around 20 before closing at 276215 apiece on BSE The first day of the FPO saw muted demand across investors Under the 20000 crore worth FPO on Friday only 470160 equity shares were bid against the offered size of 45506791 equity shares The price band for the FPO is set from 3112 to 3276 per FPO equity share for all categories of investors If Adanis FPO is fully subscribed then this will become the second largest followon public offer in India after Coal Indias 22558 crore issue in 2015 Earlier in 2020 Yes Bank had launched a 15000 crore FPO But circumstances changed drastically a few days before Adanis FPO and it would be Hindenburg Researchs report under which it accused Adani of stock manipulation and fraud schemes In its report on January 24 the New Yorkbased investment research firm said we reveal the findings of our 2year investigation presenting evidence that the 178 trillion 218 billion Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades Hindenburgs report indicated that Gautam Adani Founder and Chairman of the Adani Group has amassed a net worth of roughly 120 billion adding over 100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group s 7 key listed companies which have spiked an average of 819 in that period The findings of Hindenburgs research report on Adani involved interactions with dozens of individuals including former senior executives of Adani and also reviewing thousands of documents and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries Also the research said even if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value its 7 key listed companies have 85 downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to skyhigh valuations Adani companies debt was also among the key factors that Hindenburg pointed out It said key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans putting the entire group on precarious financial footing 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported current ratios below 1 indicating nearterm liquidity pressure Hindenburgs research note came as a shock and Adani stocks went into frenzied selling Although Adani has denied Hindenburgs accusations On January 27th Adani Enterprises filed a presentation covering Adani Group s response to Hindenburg Report It was titled Myths of Short Seller Hindenburg is the short seller According to Adanis presentation Hindenburg asked 89 questions in total While some of these questions are in regards to the groups related party transactions DRI Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and court cases However there are 21 questions in total that cannot be claimed to be the result of any investigation over a 2year period or any such assertion as they were disclosed in public documents all the way back from 2015 onwards Further Adani said 8 of 9 listed companies have a big 6 auditor such as Deloitte Haskins  Sells SRBC  Co EY SRBC  Co EY  Dharmesh Parikh  Co Joint Auditors Shah Dhandharia  Co Ernst  Young PKF Walker Chandiok  Co and K S Rao  Co etc Moreover on the leverage issue Adani mentioned 100 of its various companies are rated  these account for nearly 100 of its EBITDA Also in regards to revenue or balance sheet being artificially inflated or managed it said out of 9 listed companies in Adani portfolio  6 are subject to specific sector regulatory review for revenue costs and capex Meanwhile in terms of governance 4 of Adanis large companies are in the top 7 of the peer group in Emerging markets or the sector or the world On LAS position Adani said overall promoter leverage is less than 4 of promoter holding Earlier on January 25 Jugeshinder Singh Group CFO Adani said We are shocked that Hindenburg Research has published a report on 24 January 2023 without making any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India s highest courts The timing of the report s publication clearly betrays a brazen mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming Followon Public Offering from Adani Enterprises the biggest FPO ever in India Singh added Also on January 26 Jatin Jalundhwala Group Head  Legal Adani said the maliciously mischievous unresearched report published by Hindenburg Research on 24 Jan 2023 has adversely affected the Adani Group our shareholders and investors The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens Nevertheless the panic selloffs in these seven stocks have led to a massive correction in Gautam Adanis net worth Asias richest mans wealth is to the tune of 927 billion as of January 28 As per Bloomberg Billionaire Index Adanis net worth has dropped by 208 billion at the

SwarajyaMag,,,https://swarajyamag.com/commentary/analysing-adanis-detailed-response-to-hindenburgs-allegations-will-it-satisfy-investors-and-salvage-fpo,,None,Analysing Adani s Detailed Response to Hindenburg s Allegations Will It Satisfy Investors And Salvage FPO,The report by Hindenburg was released just before Adani s Follow on Public Offer FPO and the result was evident  the FPO has received just one per cent subscription with the retail portion being subscribed to two per cent The FPO the largest ever in India aims to raise Rs 20000 crores from investors However the response so far has been muted Institutions like mutual funds have not participated in the FPO which could be a sign of caution among these investors Hence the investor acceptance of Adani Group s explanations would be the key to its FPO s success over the next two days How Has the Adani Group Responded to Hindenburg s Allegations While Adani Group attempts to address most of the specific allegations made by Hindenburg it begins by saying that the short sellers report must not be construed as an attack on the conglomerate but a calculated attack on India the independence integrity and quality of Indian institutions and the growth story and ambition of India Hindenburg s conduct is nothing short of a calculated securities fraud under applicable law Adani Group said in its response In its previous official statement Hindenburg had asked Adani to initiate legal proceedings against Hindenburg in the US But so far there have been no reports of legal action against Hindenburg The Adani response said that not much is known about Hindenburg its employees its source of funding and other details The Hindenburg report had raised 88 issues that the Adani group has answered in its 414page response The Hindenburg report had several serious allegations some of which included involvement with stock manipulator Ketan Parekh shareholders siphoning off funds from listed entities use of shell companies issues around financial reporting and lack of disclosures Some of these allegations only highlighted past investigations of the Adani group s activities Some allegations appear superficial and circumstantial in nature and are likely to have been levelled to highlight negatives But other allegations were quite serious Adani s Response Regarding its Public Shareholders The Adani group s shareholding has been a significant point of discussion over the past year as its stocks created immense wealth for shareholders Media outlets had questioned the fact that investment funds that held a major part of the float were offshore companies These funds had invested all of their assets under management only into Adani group s stock Hindenburg claimed it had spoken to exemployees at the company that ran one of the funds who said that Adani controls the shares  Predictably the Adani group has said that it is not related to any of these entities and that it is not legally required to keep any detailed information about its shareholders under Indian law Adani s Response on Relations with Amircorp and Fugitives Hindenburg alleged that Adani group had relations with Amicorp a company that partook in shady financial activities and was involved in the 45 billion 1MDB scandal in Malaysia In its response Adani group has said that Amicorp is a provider of secretarial services and is merely one of its many clients Hindenburg had questioned Gautam Adani s elder brother Vinod Adani s involvement with alleged market manipulator fugitive chartered accountant Dharmesh Doshi The Adani group has said that the transactions were in the course of business under all applicable laws and have been disclosed It has also been said Vinod Adani doesn t hold any managerial positions within the group or look after daytoday affairs In multiple responses to Hindenburg s other allegations of a large number of related party transactions and payments by listed entities to private Adani companies the group said that the transactions were made on an armslength basis under the applicable laws and were fully disclosed in public The group also said it had received a clean chit in the investigations Hindenburg had cited in its report What Happens if the FPO Fails While the Adani group has responded to Hindenburg whether investors are satisfied with these responses remains to be seen Even before the FPO Adani group was not a part of portfolios of mutual funds despite being a part of indices and one of the largest conglomerates in India One of the reasons for this is the low availability of float and its relatively high valuation when measured in terms of sales or earnings multiples In an interview the group s chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh said that the company would postpone its expansion plans by 6 to 9 months in case the FPO is unsuccessful Of the Rs 20000 crores the group is looking to raise around Rs 11000 crores were to be invested in new businesses while Rs 4165 crores were to be used to repay borrowings and the balance would be used for general corporate purposes The stock was last trading at a discount to the FPO price due to the decline in stock price after the Hindenburg report came out Yet so far no changes have been made to the FPO price Also Read What Hindenburg Report Could Mean For Adani Group,Hence the investor acceptance of Adani Group s explanations would be the key to its FPO s success over the next two daysThe Adani response said that not much is known about Hindenburg its employees its source of funding and other detailsThe Hindenburg report had raised 88 issues that the Adani group has answered in its 414page responseIn its response Adani group has said that Amicorp is a provider of secretarial

SwarajyaMag,,,https://swarajyamag.com/commentary/what-could-the-hindenburg-report-mean-for-adani-group,,None,What Hindenburg Report Could Mean For Adani Group,Over the last few years stocks of the Adani Group have been some of the best wealth creators in the market Over the last five years the flagship group Adani Enterprises alone has seen its stock price go up seventeen fold The incredible performance of the stocks has created interest among retail shareholders while helping these stocks enter market indices as well However the success has brought increased scrutiny from investors media politicians credit rating agencies and regulatory authorities One of the reasons for the scrutiny was the groups high debt load which stood at nearly Rs 22 lakh crore at the end of FY22 Nevertheless the group clarified that a significant portion of the debt came from foreign lenders based on its strong credit rating CreditSights a credit research company came out with a report that called the group deeply overleveraged But a while later the research organisation toned down its criticism of the groups leverage after a meeting with the company Just as the furore around its debt was dying down a shortselling firm named Hindenburg Research came out with a research report titled Adani Group How The Worlds 3rd Richest Man Is Pulling The Largest Con In Corporate History The title of the report itself suggests the strong criticism it contains about the group And investor reaction to the report has been quite strong  nearly 12 billion have been collectively wiped off Adani stocks What Does the Hindenburg Report Allege The report alleges that the group is or has been associated with activities such as stock manipulation money laundering theft of taxpayer funds generating artificial revenues and siphoning off money from listed entities and that members of the Adani family are involved in these activities One of the biggest questions surrounding the Adani Group has been the rapid rise in stock price without any significant participation by retail or institutional shareholders The stocks have risen to relatively higher valuation levels than listed peers in domestic and global markets According to Hindenburg the stock valuations of the group are nearly 85 higher than the fair value of the stock measured by relative multiples The report alleges that the promoters hold a significantly higher stake than the SEBI stipulated 75 per cent through various entities After promoters a significant portion of the shareholding is owned by funds that have invested their entire asset base into a single stock which is unlikely to happen in funds Is The Adani Group Associated with Ketan Parekh and Amicorp The report alleges that SEBI had previously investigated the Adani Group for connections with stock manipulator Ketan Parekh It says that Parekhs daughter had worked with Elara Capital which runs one of the funds that has all of its assets in Adani stocks Hindenburg says that it has spoken to traders who had worked with Elara in the past and have directly admitted that the Adanis have a much higher stake in their company than is officially disclosed The report alleges that SEBI had previously pulled up the Adani group for colluding with Ketan Parekh to push up stock prices The report has attempted to establish a continuing relationship between Parekh and the Adani group by citing that Parekhs London firm Orbit Investment Securities is run by Jayechund Jingree a former director of Adani Global Limited a Mauritiusbased company Similarly the report has alleged connections between the Adani Group and Amicorp which it says is an organisation that aids in laundering money According to Hindenburg Amicorp was one of the key players in the 1MDB scandal where 45 billion worth of taxpayer money was siphoned off Further it alleges the groups contact with fugitives and the involvement of group patriarch Gautam Adanis brothers in activities that the government investigated The report also suggests that shell companies launched by members of the Adani family were used to siphon off money from the Indian entities without proper disclosures What Could These Allegations Mean for The Adani Group Clearly these allegations are quite serious and could have a potentially adverse impact on the Adani Group The Adani Groups forays into several new capitalintensive sectors like data centres cement and others have meant that it requires more capital Hence the group has been looking to tap the markets for more money through a followon public offer FPO Hindenburg coming out with a report right before Adanis FPO could be a purposeful attempt to derail the companys finances and deter investors from pumping money into the company With a negative public perception Adani Group might find it difficult to raise financing increasing risks of default in the already leveraged group Why Did A Foreign Entity Raise This Issue Some have objected to a foreign entity raising these questions to tarnish an Indian conglomerates reputation Not many sellside analysts or media persons have openly questioned large conglomerates in India  for a very good reason In the past there have been cases where Indian stock analysts have been arrested for writing defamatory reports allegedly at the behest of the companies they wrote reports against As a result many investors and analysts usually criticise companies in private but rarely in public Further shortselling is banned in India which could make the market inefficient as shortsellers help balance the market by criticising companies when necessary In the past only a Canadabased brokerage had written reports against Indian conglomerates but had to shut down its Indian operation after arrest warrants were issued against the analysts Suspicion Over Hindenburgs Timing At the same time it should be remembered that Hindenburg has short positions on the stocks before it comes out with a report incentivising it to highlight only the negatives Usually all short sellers focus on constant attacks on the management pose difficult questions during conference calls attack the business models and highlight past mistakes to precipitate a fall in the stock prices The shortsellers often rely on shockandawe techniques to gain attention Hindenburg itself has been a subject of investigation due to its practice of going short on the stocks before coming out with research reports In addition a significant part of the report focuses on past investigations and activities In a country like India where bureaucracy and politicians wield significant extralegal power several large conglomerates have been under investigation Sometimes these charges were genuine while sometimes they are simply made up only to create trouble If all investors in India were to only rely on past allegations a significant chunk of publicly listed companies in India would not be investable Yet it would serve the Adani group well to clarify these issues and help investors understand the conglomerate better Also Read Explained Why Has The Adani Group s DebtFueled Growth Raised Eyebrows,Over the last five years the

The Economic Times,,No large shareholder has exited Adani Group huge promoter debt unsubstantiated speculation says CFO Jug,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/no-large-shareholder-has-exited-adani-group-huge-promoter-debt-unsubstantiated-speculation-says-cfo-jugeshinder-singh/articleshow/97434436.cms,No large shareholder has exited Adani Group huge promoter debt unsubstantiated speculation says CFO Jugeshinder Singh  Every week on average our portfolio,None,No large shareholder has exited Adani Group huge promoter debt unsubstantiated speculation says CFO Jugeshinder Singh, A lot of large institutional investors are longterm strategic infra intergenerational investors They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities  public companies nine we have now are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in India Those entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement says Group CFOI will answer the second part first Have we seen the exit of any large shareholders From the data that we have as of the week the answer is no A lot of large institutional investors are longterm strategic infra intergenerational investors They see the wealth creation in a utility platform over a generational period because all of our entities  public companies nine we have now are primarily into the core infrastructure that is required in IndiaThose entities and their business have not changed independent of the share price movement Therefore we do not expect it and neither has there been any movement in the longterm strategic investors and positionsOn the first part of the question  yes we saw shortterm volatility and the share prices have consequently changed but again because the fundamental business has not altered in any way we believe that this volatility will pass In a weeks time our quarterly results will come out and people will see that the group continues on its upward trend and therefore we believe that over a period of time it will be seen that we are a core infra utilities platform and therefore on a weekly basis our cash flows do not alterSo to give you an example here every week on average our portfolio makes about Rs 1100 crore This Sunday also that number was achieved Next Sunday it will be the same the following Sunday it will be the same We believe that it will become clear to investors that this shortterm volatility will be addressed as we go through over the next few monthsAs correctly highlighted even in this report I could not find anything with assets and performance of our businesses So they talk about promoter level debt We hardly borrow on a corporate basis At promoter level also we do not borrow much At a promoter level we are net lenders to the market Therefore on a corporate basis also we do not have much debt On a promoter basis as I explained we are net lenders So it is a completely unsubstantiated speculation that we have huge amounts of debt at promoter levelWe are one of the few groups that formally declare total pledge positions on a regular basis quarterly It goes out as part of our credit report which goes to all investors or banking partners or shareholders even independent directors So the informed investor is very clear that we do not have this This report to that extent is mere speculation on that point of debtOn other aspects we will discuss but as we go through this period it has to be recognised and I would like to clarify for the public that for our large companies say Adani Transmission or Adani Port or Adani Green or Adani Total Gas  their credit profile is similar to that of the government sovereign companies We are the highest rated infrastructure portfolio in the country with the exception of the Government of India This has to be seen in that context We are very comfortable with this and we believe that it is a completely unsubstantiated rumour mongering though it affects us temporarilyFalseNo it is nothing to do Our promoter shareholding is both for India and we hold some of our shares from overseas In our Holcim transaction when we issued an open offer document the entire structure of our overseas holding was fully disclosed Our domestic holding structure has been disclosed in public documents for investors for the past 12 yearsTherefore for anything beyond that we are fully disclosed in our offering documents for investors for regulators and for everybody It is mere speculation and we cannot answer to speculation because this holding structure from family trust intermediate companies and companies that hold shares domestically be it Dubai to Mauritius is fully disclosed in a comprehensive manner Therefore they have made speculative charges that we control or do not control some companyThey raised a specific question We have addressed this in our rebuttal to that report Now this is a specific question they asked They said that in relation to Carmichael Rail and I am aware of this because this is part of AEL we transferred an asset to a private company and then the private company immediately wrote down the value of their asset So their implication is we over inflated Adani Enterprise revenue by writing off the asset in a private company Now this charge is of malicious nature and that is my media statement because I knew this at that point in time alsoThis is the malicious nature of this report which is borderline lying and it is certainly a misrepresentation First we actually disclosed these ourselves that this is a related party transaction Then we disclosed fully how the transaction was done Now if somebody claims to have done two years of research they would have known that this asset when you are transferred had its accounting treatment known in Adani Enterprise They could have seen from the same note that in Adani Enterprise we had already written down the value of the assets and charged it to the PL as a loss They knew this and yet they still published this questionI am assuming they know this because they claim to have done two years of research Now if they did not know this then it is just purely ignorant and malicious If they have knowingly done this it is a case of genuine falsehoods and misrepresentation So this is a clear example which we have highlighted and we have made public in our response which is well over 400 pages fully annotated and we have attached the documents so people can verify themselves that 68 out of 88 are these types of questions they have askedWe borrow very little at the promoter level and we declare it and therefore the coverage that we have in relation to that borrowing is we have cash to actually pay the borrowings full stop Therefore it is completely baseless that there were margin costs Before margin cost we will just pay and borrow and completely retire the shareholder lossThe FPO is as you know is a threepart process and we deliberately selected the FPO because we wanted to make sure and achieve certain outcomes broader institutional participation broader analyst coverage and actually broader HNI and retail participationIn the current situation or due to the volatility on Friday the FPO price is below the retail target price So we expect retail participation We will wait to see how it goes but the long term investors see the value of the Adani Enterprise differently and they are fully committed for the FPO and we have no information that that has changedTherefore we are moving ahead because we believe that with our institutional and strategic investor base the offer will anyway be fully subscribed Now once and that is why we clarify that the FPO is proceeding as normal and the reason the confidence comes is because of the way longterm investors look at AEL value AEL value is not in the share price of AEL It is just a holding valueThe real value of AEL is in incubating assets like Adani Airports Adani Data Centre business Adani new industry green hydrogen business Adani Roads Adani Digital Labs Adani Wilmar and mining services business Those businesses are still performing as they are and they still have the same value Now that value will be exercised when we demerge this business in the next four to six yearsSo longterm strategic investors is what they are aiming for and that value has not changed because that is not representative of the AEL The AEL share price is not representative of that value fully it is a discounted value So longterm investors are comfortable with the underlying value Retail investors will see some pull back but even some ultra HNI and HNI will participateCorrect Our objective on the retail investor base is twofold one we want to spread out the share register which is our objective and which we expect to complete by 20252026 Now in the short term naturally some change will happen because of the possible pullback of retail investors but it is very important for us to understand what we want to do for the retail investorWe are in infra and being an assetbased company it is very important that the Indian public owns its own assets It would be good for the person going to Mumbai airport to own some shares because it is their asset it is the assets of India Indian public must participate and we want to encourage that participation It is a bit of a disappointment that there will be some pullback but in the longer term we believe our objective to continue to encourage Indian retail investors will pay dividends and the wealth creation that Indian investors retail investors should enjoy from Indian assets will occur That is one of the key objectives of our founder and that the public should participate in the wealth creation of hard real assets in the countryYes Gujarat Ambuja shares were never pledged and we had clarified at that time also that it was a representation based on the very technical definition that Sebi has the shares are never pledged The way the acquisition of that nature is accomplished is that we tell our bankers and debt capital providers that we will hold a minimum number of shares and not the value of sharesSo we are not sellers of our equity and we said we will own 63 odd of Ambuja shares which we own So it is not a loan against shares not pledged in any way It is a security package which is different from pledge but that is counted in encumbrance by SEBI and that is why there was some misunderstanding and people misreported that as pledgeIt is not for us to give a discount It is important for us that there is a value equation here and that is based on the sum of parts of real assets being developed We very carefully evaluated the events of last week and the consensus feedback was that you please go ahead as planned and that is what we are doingWe are in a position where last week we made an EBITDA portfolio level of Rs 1100 crore Next week it would be the same and the week after that would be the same We are a nondiscretionary consumer spending portfolio Therefore underlying businesses are as they are  super high

and the fact that the two companies that were mentioned in the Hindenburg report were mentioned in the document listing underwriters for the sale In its report Forbes said Elara Capital India Private Limited a subsidiary of Londonbased investment firm Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital an Indian brokerage firm were two of the underwriters in the list of ten companies provided disclosed by Adani In its report Hindenburg claimed that Elara Capital s India Opportunities Fund serves as a stock parking entity for Adani companies Further it claimed that Monarch Networth Capital has been partially owned by Adani Properties Private Limited Also it claimed Albula an offshore fund identified as a proxy of Adani held a 10 ownership in Monarch Based on this information provided by Hinderburg in the report Forbes speculated that the inclusion of these companies could mean Adani bought into its shares The report read The involvement of Elara Capital and Monarch Networth Capital

a Lehman Brotherslike catastrophe,Earlier last month an explosive report by a US research firm Hindenburg Research caused tremors in the Indian stock markets after it accused the Adani Group of manipulating its share prices and committing accounting fraud Gautam Adani the founder and chairman of the Adani Group one of the top 5 wealthiest people in the world before the report was published saw his fortunes turn and wealth erode as nervous investors pulled money out by selling their holdings of the Adani Group stocks The crisis was exacerbated by the Adani Group s decision to call off an oversubscribed FPO in view of the serious allegations levelled against the group by Hindenburg Research While the business conglomerate trashed the report as malicious disinformation and released a whopping 413page statement to contest the claims made by Hindenburg the attendant confusion uncertainty and anxiety among investors sent the group s stocks into free fall The pathological hatred harboured by the leftleaning liberals in India who abhor successful businessmen for their ability to generate wealth and provide employment which they never could with their hoary activism and communist principles also contributed to the bloodbath that Adani Group stocks witnessed at the stock market In a matter of just 31 trading sessions the shares of Adani Enterprises one of the foremost Adani Group companies listed on the stock market crashed 76 per cent from their alltime high The stock which hit an alltime high of Rs 418955 on December 21 2022 slipped to a 52week low of Rs 101710 last week plummeting 7572 from its peak Taking into account the market cap of Rs 157 lakh crore for the Adani Group s flagship the firm lost over Rs 288 lakh crore in market cap from its record high On December 21 last year the market cap at the close of trade of the firm stood at Rs 445 lakh crore As Adani Group s market cap was taking a beating on stock markets with some estimates claiming the group lost over 100 bn in valuation a raft of leftleaning liberals  evidently with little understanding of how bourses work gleed over the losses suffered by the business conglomerate They cited the lowercircuit hit by Adani Group shares to emphasise that the Hindenburg Research group s allegations had some measure of truth to force a market correction on the stock markets But more importantly they used the stock market crash of the Adani Group shares to undermine the Indian growth story witnessed under PM Modi s government in the last nine years They insisted that the Indian Growth Story is as hollow as the Adani Group shares that are now tanking after allegations of gross manipulation and accounting fraud claimed by Hindenburg The idea was to politicise the stock market crisis and coopt it to use as a stick to beat the Modi government and implicate wrongdoing on its part by highlighting the alleged close relationship between Adani and PM Modi Nevertheless the Adani Group shares saw an impressive recovery this week with two trading sessions seeing many of the Group s shares touching upper circuit levels The stocks of Adani Enterprises the company that was at the receiving end of negative sentiments fostered by Hindenburg and paranoia stoked by the leftliberal cabal touched a high of Rs 196270 during Tuesday trading sessions and is currently hovering at Rs 1803 levels up by 1469 per cent at the time of writing this report Source NSE Notwithstanding the remarkable recovery registered by Adani Enterprises on the bourses it is worth examining some of the doomsday scenarios that usual suspects foreboded which may have contributed to the decline in the share prices Many gloating over the Adani crisis quickly declared it as India s Lehman Brothers moment the culmination of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States that triggered a worldwide recession back in 2008 Of course they did not elevate Adani Group to the extent of bringing about a global recession They restricted their contention to the realm of Indian economic space which they declared would suffer massively if Hindenburg s allegations against Adani turned out correct Adani Fundamentals are strong  balance sheet robust Lehman Brothers Sept 10 2008 Fundamentals are strong  balance sheet robust Sept 15 2008 Filed for bankruptcy Did you mislead investors asked US Congress in their hearing  pictwittercomzkf76EVQAH  Praveen Chakravarty  February 2 2023 Lehman Brother dooba tha toh saari duniya mein recession de gaya tha Socho Adani dooba toh kya hoga  Kapil  February 1 2023 In 2007 Lehman Brothers had a record market capitalization of 60 billion Then came the crash By 2016 it cost the US economy about 46 trillion Since Adani Group has lost 100 billion in value The Government must step in to protect the broader economy  Salman Anees Soz  February 2 2023 But their characterisation of the Adani crisis being a trigger to cause the undoing of the Indian growth story speaks more to their pathological hatred for India and an implicit acceptance that India had charted an enviable growth story in the last few years than their genuine concerns for retail investors Why Adani s fall would expose Adani and not be a harbinger of a Lehman Brotherslike However comparing the Adani crisis to the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers is like comparing apples to oranges It is disingenuous of the gloaters to draw a parallel between the two issues even when they are starkly distinct In fact the rush to hyphenate the Adani crisis and Lehman Brothers bankruptcy betray that liberals have no understanding of either of the issues For starters Lehman Brothers was a financial institute not a business conglomerate like the Adani Group The Lehman Brothers crisis was a significant event in the 2008 global financial crisis It was a bankruptcy filing by the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15 2008 which was one of the largest and most complex in US history The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers triggered a chain reaction in the financial markets and led to a global credit crunch as well as a drop in the stock markets around the world The crisis highlighted the interconnectivity and vulnerability of the global financial system and led to significant government intervention in many countries including the US government s Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP and other measures to stabilize the financial system and restore economic growth A financial institute especially one that was as deeply embedded into the system as Lehman Brothers incurs a greater risk of triggering cascading ramifications including recession through its involvement in financing disparate organisations and sectorsthe crash of anyone could severely impact the organisation s health and future viability By contrast the Adani Group is a business conglomerate whose primary concern is to stay in business meet its financial obligations and provide value to its investors Unlike a financial institute the Adani Group s fortunes depend on its actions and not on the performance of other organisations or sectors In addition to this many stateowned financial institutions like the LIC State Bank of India Punjab National Bank and others have minuscule exposure to the investments or loans granted by them to the Adani Group For instance the SBI recently cleared apprehensions stating that it has only 09 per cent exposure to Adani and has granted loans against shares but against cashflows The largest lender also said that it is confident in Adani s repayment of loans adding that the group has a historical record of paying on time The underlying cause of Lehman Brothers bankruptcy was a combination of factors including excessive risktaking leverage and a lack of diversification in its investment portfolio The bank was heavily invested in mortgagebacked securities which suffered significant losses as the US housing market declined and the subprime mortgage crisis deepened As the value of these securities declined Lehman Brothers balance sheet became increasingly strained and it was unable to find the capital it needed to meet its financial obligations Additionally the bank s high levels of leverage or borrowing magnified its losses and made it difficult for it to survive the market turmoil The combination of these factors ultimately led to Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and its impact on the global financial system While the Lehman Brothers collapse could be attributed to a deeper financial malaise plaguing the US financial sector the allegations on the Adani Group do not reflect systemwide wrongdoing If proven the allegations would expose the malpractices espoused by the Adani Group and the corresponding fall would only impact the business conglomerate Those using the Hindenburg Research report to paint gloom and doom and predict a Lehman Brotherslike scenario are unjustifiably resorting to alarmism and paranoia to push their political agenda,Gautam Adani the founder and chairman of the Adani Group one of the top 5 wealthiest people in the world before the report was published saw his fortunes turn and wealth erode as nervous investors pulled money out by selling their holdings of the Adani Group stocksNevertheless the Adani Group shares saw an impressive recovery this week with two trading sessions seeing many of the Group s shares touching upper

OpIndia,,,https://www.opindia.com/2023/01/adani-group-hindenburg-report-short-selling-points-to-ponder/,,2023-01-31 08:26:56+00:00,Adani Hindenburg shortselling and how it is all about Markets being at work Salient aspects of the saga worth pondering over,I know I am wading into a topic that has been discussed enough in recent days The Hindenburg report on the Adani Group has stirred a lot of interest As Jinit Jain s article has pointed out the CONLEFT ecosystem s attacks on Adani and their embrace of this report to use as a stick to beat Modi has split the right too  should they defend Adani or not Let me ignore that for now and focus on other aspects We must understand and acknowledge that short sellers are very much a part of the overall free market ecosystem They are often wrong and have their own profit motives  like any other player  but that doesn t mean they can be condemned wholesale They play a valuable role in unearthing fraud and bubble stocks Many like Jim Chanos are highly respected even when they are wrong  as they have been with Tesla for a long long time They may yet be proved right There is a special breed of short sellers that are activists  they go around actively promoting their theories perhaps hoping many will buy into it dump the stock and help turn their doomsday prophecies into reality At that point it hardly matters if the original allegations are right or wrong Carson Block Andrew Left are examples of such activist short sellers Such activist short sellers usually target the big guys Even if they are completely wrong and motivated one must admire their guts There are easier ways to make money believe me Adani is not the first or will be the last to be targeted by such people  they go for stocks with high PE steep runup in price and are led by visible and controversial people After all this is where they can find traction for their allegations and maximum profit potential  again this is not wrong If posting crazily optimistic projections on Tesla to name but one stock while being long on the stock is kosher so is posting doomsday on the same stock hoping to profit on its decline As long as there is proper disclosure intelligent research or insights and the allegations survive the usual laws of defamation The shorts pay a heavy price for their positions if they are wrong or if the market doesn t believe them whether they are activists or not Many lost their shirts on meme stocks like AMC and folded up Of course they also made killings as George Soros did with the Pound sterling It is not just the right wing that attacks short sellers  everyone does if it suits them In fact in woke liberal paradise of the USA DOJ which is supposedly independent has opened a criminal investigation into short sellers and the FBI sent search warrants to many of them Imagine Modi doing this American politicians of various hues have harangued about the alleged damage shorts cause the economy while often playing the market themselves including taking short positions I personally think it is more harmful to ban shorts Yes they distort as the famous academic Prof Mitts report alleges They spend huge amounts of time and money to research and uncover frauds not to speak of personal and financial risks for uncertain rewards If you ban them the incentive goes Who will be the loser The small investor who bought into tulipstyle bubbles won t have access to such analysis If all this sounds like a defence of short sellers you are right It very much is Now let us turn our attention to the specific case  Adani Group and Hindenburg Again a few points are relevant Just as a disclosure I don t personally short any stock I own them mostly for the long term I do not own any Adani Group stock I also have no investments in any hedge or other funds that are shortfocused Adani Group has been selected for the exact same reasons I mentioned earlier  its stock has run up quite a bit deservedly or otherwise But then the whole market is frothy not just in India but in the USA too And Adani is to say the least controversial perhaps next only to Musk I am not trying to defend Gautam Adani  he is perfectly capable of doing it himself I am more concerned about Indian infrastructure which needs more such investments given the pathetic state it was left to us when dynastic loot ended in Delhi Having said that I have some comments on the report In the very first paragraph it says the accounting frauds and other manipulations are decades old In that case the CONLEFT ecosystem may find they have scored yet another selfgoal Pidis may well be careful your lifafas and table scrap are at risk if this starts biting the hands that feed India has signed special treaties that encourage routing investments through Mauritius etc Obviously Modi or Adani did not invent this loophole In fact in recent years the NDA government has with lots of effort amended some treaties tightened them  and in the process got attacked as antibusiness Having overseas subsidiaries and holding companies especially in taxattractive domains like Singapore UAE etc is not wrong in of itself  many do it Not just Indian conglomerates The challenges this presents to Income tax and other authorities is a separate problem that needs serious discussion but not one that focuses on any one entity It is also common for companies that fund infra such as solar or other power plants to insist on separate legal entities and related ownership structures for each project This is to avoid the problem from one affecting the other It is hilarious to see the report pointing out close family control of the Group  this is how Corporate India or for that matter Political India runs Socalled key person risk etc is well known and is hardly an Adanispecific problem You don t need a short seller to educate us on that Adani is into infratransmission green energy power airports ports etc All of these have considerable time horizons long gestation periods and huge capital expenditures But that is also a blessing as it is not easy to get into It is not a group that s into dotcom crypto chain marketing etc that are scams or bubble almost at birth All these businesses require funding from deeppocketed institutional investors with a longterm view These investors don t read sellside or hedge fund analyst reports to do due diligence They have access to data information and insights that we simply don t And they don t recall loans or investments at short notice Adani is not likely their first or only infra investment The report s prediction or prayer of one liquidity event creating a cascading collapse seems farfetched What the report doesn t talk about is equally important  loans that are NOT from related parties Are these fickle investors Too much shortterm loans used to fund longterm projects No idea Related party loans over which the report spends a huge amount of time are resilient to shortterm mood changes even if they are routed through a complex web of entities for tax or other reasons Even the attack over the current ratio an odd metric to pick for a longterm infra group seems halfhearted  let s throw this and see if it sticks  There is no mention of what the ratio was a year ago or two years ago Has it gotten worse or better I guess if worse it would have found mention A lot of the Adani group assets and entities are in advanced markets like Singapore Australia which are regulated independent of SEBI Modi or India The entire market cap of Adani Group  even before the decline is US218 billions To see this in perspective BSE market cap total is well over 3 trillions The report itself argues that Adani controls far more of the group than he has declared  well over 75 And it also says funds have largely avoided investing in it If so who exactly is the victim Clearly Adani has more skin in the game than most Indian lalas In fact many of them control their companies with far less holding and hence are not left holding the bag when things collapse Even if the entire Adani Group collapses it will leave India with infrastructure assets like ports that will have value in a booming economy Buyers can be found It is not an arms brokerage or landflipping outfit that dynasties and their damaads are more familiar with Much has been said about the 400page response by Adani as if that is a crime In fact only 50 pages are the real response  the rest are annexures mostly of public documents Note that the Hindenburg report is quite long as well and repetitive I do not agree that these attacks by Hindenburg constitute an attack on India  This line of defence will only hurt It will be used to gloss over all the other deficiencies in the original analysis and the points made in the response The corrupt media ecosystem has already picked on this as if that s the only thing in the report This is not market advise and I am no expert but my gut feel is Adani Group will survive this saga But if the report leads to inventor education curiosity about activist short sellers better disclosure practices stronger regulatory oversight and general cleansing of the system it would have done far more good than harm,Many like Jim Chanos are highly respected even when they are wrong  as they have been with Tesla for a long long timeIt is not just the right wing that attacks short sellers  everyone does if it suits themNow let us turn our attention to the specific case  Adani Group and HindenburgI do not own any Adani Group stockThis is not market advise and I am no expert but my gut feel is Adani Group will survive this saga,"Ganesh R, Https, Fnganesh.Substack.Com, Ganesh Is A Software Consultant Who Has Spent The Last Few Decades Overseas For Work.

government the project faced several obstacles Upon completion the Vizhinjam port is expected to become a significant competitor to the transhipment ports of Colombo Singapore and Dubai It will be the only transhipment hub in the Indian subcontinent situated in a strategic location on the Indian coastline and close to international shipping routes This location makes it a central hub for shipping

neighbourhood,February 04 2023 0914 pm  Updated February 05 2023 1001 am IST  NEW DELHI Caught between a row over the price of coal and this week s crash in its share valuations and credit ratings the Adani Power project planned as a major Indian infrastructure push to provide electricity to Bangladesh may be delayed by another six months local reports said The project is one of a number in the neighbourhood  including those in Bangladesh Sri Lanka Nepal and Myanmar  that have accompanied the Narendra Modiled government s Neighbourhood First initiative in the past few years Highlighting the bigticket announcements Adani chairperson Gautam Adani has met with regional leaders including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in September 2022 and thenSri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa while Adani family members have met with senior officials from Myanmar and even Indonesia However with the group s slide in fortunes and the cancellation of the Adani Enterprises FPO governments in neighbouring countries are watching the company s market situation closely even as the Ministry of External Affairs MEA made it clear that any setback to projects would not affect ties emphasising that the Adani stock s fall was not a foreign policy issue  If a certain project is not working for financial or economic reasons I don t think that s a reflection on the relationship MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday Project delayed again He was responding to questions about the controversy surrounding an Adani thermal power project in Jharkhand s Godda which was due to supply electricity for Bangladesh starting from January 2022 a deadline that has already been delayed twice According to the United News of Bangladesh s report quoting government officials which has not been denied the Bangladesh Power Development Board BPDB has written to Adani Power demanding that they reduce the price of coal to be purchased from Adani s Carmichael Mines in Australia Presently Adani Power is reportedly billing Bangladesh 400 per metric tonne far higher than the 250MT rate that BPDB is paying at its other thermal plants The Adani Group did not respond to requests for a comment from The Hindu but it is understood that unless BPDB sends a demand note for procuring the coal the Godda project transmission will be delayed further State officials quoted in a number of local reports say that the project s prime lenders Stateowned Power Finance Corp PFC and Rural Electrification Corp REC would then have to sign off on the delay MIngling corporatenational interests Other Adani projects in the region have also been in the limelight for various controversies including in Myanmar where the Adani group exited a 290 Yangon river port project in 2022 after the threat of US sanctions In Sri Lanka an uproar had followed the leak of a November 2021 letter from the Ceylon Electricity Board s thenchairman MMC Ferdinando to the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry asking them to allow an Adani proposal for a 500 MW wind energy project off the coast of Mannar and to treat it as a proposal from the Government of India to Sri Lanka  When asked about this during a parliamentary committee meeting Mr Ferdinando who later recanted his words said that he had been summoned by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who told him that he was under pressure from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to okay the Adani proposal Mr Rajapaksa denied the allegation and Mr Ferdinando resigned in June 2022 after withdrawing his statement Officials told The Hindu that the government is watching developments in the wake of the latest trouble for the Adani Group given that Sri Lanka which is in the middle of a financial crisis is hoping to see more infrastructure investment from India Apart from renewable energy the Adani Group has also begun construction on the 700 million Colombo port project for the West Container Terminal and officials said that they are not concerned at the moment as the funding for the port is on a strong footing  Adani forays seen as push by India Meanwhile officials in Nepal are also tracking developments in the Adani saga given the group s plans to lay transmission lines to connect hydropower projects in Nepal to a planned South Asian renewable energy grid Such a grid would provide power from Nepal and Bhutan to India Bangladesh and possibly Sri Lanka in the future After Nepal PM Sher Bahadur Deuba s visit to Delhi last year when he and Mr Modi had issued a joint vision statement on energy cooperation Adani Group officials had visited Nepal with a particular interest in hydropower projects in the Karnali Basin However they have not made any announcement yet possibly given the recent change in government Definitely people in Nepal are interested in the developments around the Adani group as the group is seen as close to the current Indian administration and their forays into Nepal were generally viewed as part of a push by the Indian establishment  said Sujeev Shakya a business consultant and founderchair of the Nepal Economic Forum The Adani Group declined requests from The Hindu for a comment on the sustainability of project financing in the neighbourhood especially given the current developments In a region where energy and connectivity are in high demand India s neighbours will be particularly interested in how quickly the group can stabilise its position in order to procure funding for its projects,The project is one of a number in the neighbourhood  including those in Bangladesh Sri Lanka Nepal and Myanmar  that have accompanied the Narendra Modiled government s Neighbourhood First initiative in the past few yearsPresently Adani Power is reportedly billing Bangladesh 400 per metric tonne far higher than the 250MT

SVB,Following the shutdown of the USbased Silicon Valley Bank SVB on Friday March 10 billionaire investor Bill Ackman sought a bailout package for the commercial bank from the taxfunded US government Ackman is the same financial expert who upheld the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani group which wiped out 10 lakh crores worth of investor s money from the Indian conglomerate in less than two weeks time While he did not shy away from casting aspersions on the integrity of the Adani group and fomenting turmoil in Indian markets the billionaire investor took a radically different approach when it came to the US market The failure of could destroy an important longterm driver of the economy as VCbacked companies rely on SVB for loans and holding their operating cash If private capital can t provide a solution a highly dilutive gov t preferred bailout should be considered  Bill Ackman  March 10 2023 In a tweet on Friday March 10 Bill Ackman claimed The failure of SVB Financial Group could destroy an important longterm driver of the economy as VCbacked companies rely on SVB for loans and holding their operating cash If private capital can t provide a solution a highly dilutive gov t preferred bailout should be considered he demanded despite being well aware that such a bailout package if provided will be funded by taxpayers The billionaire investor further added The govt could also guarantee deposits in exchange for a dilutive warrant issuance and other covenants and protections If SVB Financial Group is indeed solvent this would buy time to enable SVB to restore the franchise and raise new private capital The gov t could also guarantee deposits in exchange for a dilutive warrant issuance and other covenants and protections If is indeed solvent this would buy time to enable SVB to restore the franchise and raise new private capital  Bill Ackman  March 10 2023 He tried to make a case for the defunct commercial bank by claiming that the bailout package would serve the interests of depositors and not the poor management and equity holders Bill Ackman concluded The risk of failure and deposit losses here is that the next least wellcapitalized bank faces a run and fails and the dominoes continue to fall That is why govt intervention should be considered The risk of failure and deposit losses here is that the next least wellcapitalized bank faces a run and fails and the dominoes continue to fall That is why gov t intervention should be considered  Bill Ackman  March 10 2023 Earlier the billionaire investor did not shy away from defending Sam BankmanFried the founder of ponzi cryptocurrency exchange FTX He even claimed that Sam is innocent until proven guilty and that we should not sacrifice our core values in a rush to convict Response during the Adani Crash While Bill Ackman was seen batting for the nowarrested American entrepreneur and the Silicon Valley Bank SVB Financial Group his reaction was starkly different when it came to the Indian conglomerate In his response over the fiasco on January 27 this year the billionaire investor had said Adani s response to Hindenburg Research is the same as Herbalife s response to our original 350page presentation Herbalife remains a pyramid scheme I found the Hindenburg report highly credible and extremely wellresearched Adani Group s response speaks volumes Caveat emptor Bill Ackman emphasised Screengrab of the tweets by Bill Ackman While he conceded that he did not undertake any independent research and his judgment was based on the cursory reading of the Hindenburg Research report and Adani s response this gave an opportunity to the likes of Ravish Kumar to cast aspersions on the Indian conglomerate based on Ackman s tweets The billionaire investor in Adani s case did not seek a bailout package despite being aware of the shortterm impact that the report of the USbased shortseller would have on the Indian economy and markets at large He also did not bother to keep his innocent until proven guilty argument forward in Gautam Adani s case as he did in Sam Bankman Fried s case The sweeping statements of Bill Ackman were used by propagandists to suggest that the Indian conglomerate has been involved in wrongdoings The Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank On Friday March 10 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC announced the shutdown of the USbased Silicon Valley Bank SVB and the seizure of its assets The development was the result of the sudden shutdown of Silvergate Capital Corp and the unmindful fundraising of SVB which created panic in the technology industry Founded in 1983 Silicon Valley Bank operated out of Santa Clara in California and provided various services such as online banking treasury management and foreign exchange trade Reportedly the crisis came to light on March 8 this year after SVB Financial Group parent organisation of Silicon Valley Bank announced a sale of 21 billion of its securities This was further worsened by the sale of company shares worth 225 billion to shore up its finances prompted by high deposit outflows at the bank caused by a downturn in the startup industry As a result the Silicon Valley Bank shares fell 60 leading to a whopping loss of 80 billion To salvage the business SVB CEO Greg Becker held a conference call with clients and venture capital investors requesting them to stay calm to avoid further withdrawals However it was to no avail Many venture capitalists instead instructed portfolio companies to minimise their exposure to Silicon Valley Bank withdraw their cash and look for other lenders thus further exacerbating the crisis In February this year American business magazine Forbes placed SVB Financial Group in the 20th position in the list of America s Best Banks

Power Maharashtra Ltd APML and Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd APRL and Maharashtra Eastern Grid Power Transmission Company Limited MEGPTCL the Mumbaibench of CESTAT upheld the adjudicating authority s order in favour of AdaniThe DRI has filed a civil appeal before the apex court against the CESTAT order on APML and APRL in November court filings showMeanwhile sources told ET a similar appeal is likely to be filed against MEGPTCL too The department has also sent a proposal to CBIC the department s parent to appeal against the Tribunals order before the apex court A legal view will be taken before moving the SC said a government official privy to the development These sources also pointed out that no fresh evidence can be submitted before the apex court and the appeal is only on points of law and factOther than the entities the appeal also names three individuals including Vinod Shantilal Shah alias Vinod Shantilal Adani court documents accessed by ET states The appeal was filed on November 11 and the matter was further listed on December 16 In May 2014 the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence  DRI  had issued SCN to APML and APRL alleging overvaluationIn August 2017 the Adjudicating authority of DRI ie the same authority who issued the SCN after dealing with in detail set aside all the allegations and dropped the SCN It has been held by the Adjudicating Authority that all the imports were genuine being undertaken at arm s length and concluded that the value declared is correct and the value is not required to be redetermined had dropped the SCN and had given a favourable order in the matterOn appeal by Customs Department CESTAT Mumbai in July 2022 dismissed the appeal filed by Customs Department and upheld the Order of Adjudicating Authority The matter has not yet been listed for hearing spokesperson for Adani group told ETThe Hidenburg report that has hit Adani group stock had mentioned the DRI investigation The total mcap of the group has declined to Rs 10 lakh crore on February 3 2023 from Rs 192 lakh crore as of January 24 2023Responding to the alleged involvement of Adani family members in instances of roundtripping of diamond consignments at grossly inflated values to and from India the group in a press release slamming the report had said Certain allegations concerning diamond exports have all been closed by the Customs Excise And Service Tax Appellate Tribunal CESTAT in our favour This decision has been further confirmed by the Supreme Court itself twice over a fact which has been deliberately ignored and concealed in the Hindenburg report which contemptuously raises questions on the competence of the appellate tribunal with baseless claims that it has ignored evidence the group saidIn July 2021  after minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the DRI is investigating certain entities belonging to the Adani Group  the conglomerate approached the CESTAT seeking early hearing on the matter saying it had been getting enquiries from independent directors auditors financial institutions and lenders about the status of the caseIn July 2022 the tribunal in its order observed that the department s case pertaining to alleged overvaluation is based on certain documents received from the foreign branches of the Indian banks which were not certified as per the conditions prescribed under Section 138 C 4 of the Customs ActThe tribunal also observed that the investigation carried out by the DRI was incomplete  The tribunal opined that while the department submitted the documents received from the Indian banks it failed to make the foreign banks join the probe since the department could not interrogate or make Standard Chartered Bank join the investigation cannot be a reason to ignore the possibility of it acting as an active banker on behalf of EIF the offshore entity for the purpose of remitting the amount of original equipment manufacturer said the tribunal order The burden was on the department to prove why the total remittance amount was only through these two banks and no other bank It therefore follows that the investigations carried out by the revenue was incomplete the order saidOn March 15 2014 the DRI sent a common show cause notice alleging that EIF an entity based in Dubai Adani Power Maharashtra Ltd APML and Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd APRL were related entities for the rweason that EIF was owned and controlled by Vinod Adani through EIH  the holding company of EIF  and that he was also a shareholder in Adani Enterprises Ltd  which in turn owned and controlled APML and APRL through its subsidiary Adani Power LimitedThe show cause notice also alleged that APML APRL Electrogen Infra FZE EIF and other respondents conspired to siphon off foreign exchange abroad for the benefit of their related entitiesThe notice called upon the respondents to show cause as to why the declared value in respect of the goods imported by APML and APRL should not be rejected under Rule 12 of the Customs Valuation Determination of Value of Imported Goods Rules 2007According to the DRI s case in the guise of import of power sector machinery and equipment APML and APRL the two entities of Adani Enterprises Limited appear to have indulged in overvaluation of impugned imported goods The actual value of the imported goods is Rs 318761 crore whereas the same have been invoiced at Rs 716173 crore thus leading to an overvaluation Rs 397412 crore which appears to have been siphoned off abroad through EIF an intermediary at UAE which is controlled and managed by Vinod Adani one of the promoters of Adani Enterprises Limited flagship company of the Adani Group The Adani Group has repeatedly denied that Vinod Adani is a promoter of the groupHowever the tribunal observed that when documents are not admissible in evidence the department cannot seek redetermination of value on the basis of these documents,The department has also sent a proposal to CBIC

week started with a bang On 29 January Adani Group released a 413page response to the various allegations made against it by Hindenburg Research a United Statesbased short selling firm Adani came out with all guns blazing In its reply the group claimed to have answered all of the 88 questions Hindenburg posed in its original report that was released on 24 January Perhaps Adani Group also felt it could take advantage of the Rightwing social media cohort rallying around it The company claimed that Hindenburg s report was a calculated attack on India and also the independence integrity and quality of Indian institutions The fightback didn t stop there Adani Group went on to take aim at Hindenburg itself saying it has not published this report for any altruistic reasons but purely out of selfish motives and in flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws  Also read How Gautam Adani is helping Modi govt with India s foreign policy challenges Hindenburg s scathing

itself to an attack on India To be clear we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future Hindenburg said adding that they also believe India s future is being held back by Adani Group which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation We also believe that fraud is fraud even when it s perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world Hindenburg added in its reply Clearly this David was not going to take Goliath s attacks lying down The short seller went on to say that in terms of substance Adani s 413page response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to our report Indeed it is worth noting that in Adani s lengthy response the annexurescontaining background information on past court cases and judgmentsbegan on page 55 Hindenburg pointed out that although Adani Group claimed to have answered all of its questions it had sidestepped the critical issue of Gautam Adani s elder brother Vinod Adani his alleged front companies and their alleged dealings with the Adani Group firms In what has come to become the hallmark of Hindenburg s brutal style it said In other words we are expected to believe that Gautam Adani has no idea why his brother Vinod lent massive sums of money to Adani entities and no idea where the money originated from If any of that were true Gautam could have easily cleared up the mystery by calling his brother Hindenburg further asked in its scathing reply Or asking him Vinod Adani at the next family dinner why he has been directing billions of dollars to Adanicontrolled entities through a network of opaque offshore shell entities it added Also read How to survive a bear attack  lessons for Adani in Ambani s stock market victory in 1980s

from Adani stocks the previous week This relief however was shortlived On WednesdayBudget day incidentallynews emerged that Credit Suisse Group AG a Swiss investment banking firm had stopped accepting Adani Group bonds as collateral for margin loans given to its private banking clients While it didn t come right out to say it this basically meant Credit Suisse no longer trusted the value of the

Indian capitalism This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in,2023-02-04 02:45:14+00:00,Market has won  now it s for Adani to decide whether he will lose or not,This week s National Interest isn t about Gautam Adani This is instead about Indian capitalism This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in our independent history Or more precisely post1991 history Since the expansion opening up and modernisation of Indian markets began in the summer of 1991 many crises have struck it periodically Among these were Harshad Mehta Ketan Parekh Fairgrowth and others Each one held out a crippling threat to Indian markets and to the new equity culture among common Indians which is so crucial to a new capitalism Each rocked Parliament pauperised many wellmeaning investors and sent some crooks to jail if briefly But there are five crucial differences between these and now  None of these crises arose when the Indian markets and economy were globally integrated  These were crises of domestic markets where domestic interventions either by financial or regulatory institutions  or even a phone call from North Block  could make a difference The latest one is playing out fully in global markets and more importantly international media  The old crises  check out the socalled KP7 KP for Ketan Parekh for example  mostly concerned Indian companies doing the bulk of their business in India This one is about India s most globalised corporate  The earlier crises emerged here and the whistleblowers or investigative journalists who exposed these were Indian This one has been triggered by a very foreign and tiny financial institution  The fifth and the most significant difference from the standpoint of this column  is that those who ve created this kerfuffle aren t whistleblowers Nor are they activist shareholders They are coming at it purely for profit They are shortsellers They have a fully disclosed vested interest in bringing down the share price of a company they re investing in by shortselling its UStraded bonds and nonIndiantraded derivative instruments Who said you only make money in the stock markets when your share goes up Also Read Prannoy and Radhika Roy and the world of news this week on The reason we list this fifth difference as the most critical is simple When foreigners invest in our companies when our companies list overseas when the world sings our praises when FDI and FPI figures zoom we celebrate Do we at the same time have the nerve to take the downsides that come with it One that we our government financial institutions or regulators can no longer influence or armtwist this allpowerful entity called the market  Two the need to accept that even what looks like a bunch of young upstarts can look to make mega profits by taking down one of your biggest conglomerates in the market Markets in good capitalism have no nationalist lens If money has no colour it also carries no passport And those who play in the market love their money first All national political or ideological loyalties come after that It is for all these reasons that we call the ongoing crisis the greatest stress test for Indian capitalism yet And as we conclude the first full week of the market action on this we can acknowledge that so far Indian capitalism has passed that test In fact with a score of almost 10 out of 10 Surprised Almost two weeks into the crisis the Modi government hasn t said a word about it None of the regulatory institutions has intervened in the market in any manner whatsoever least of all as if to help the Adani Group absorb the blow better The conglomerate has been left to its own devices If at all the NSE has done the usual  and prudent  thing of increasing margin payments to curb excessive speculation This is fully the NSE s mandate in a situation of heavy volatility While the conglomerate called it a foreign conspiracy to attack and damage India and its institutions the government the entire finance ministry establishment regulators and the ruling party leadership have all kept mum Never mind the flag If India s most powerful political establishment in almost five decades responds to a situation like this as if it s something that must only play out between a corporate and the market it is the coming of age of Indian capitalism It is as if let the market take its course is the new let the law take its own course  Think on the contrary what would have followed if the mighty Indian state had acted in the way it might have when our political economy was less evolved Really bad ideas like the suspension of trading and the launch of investigations against the greed amoral and whathaveyou shortsellers could ve found currency Even the whiff of such a false step would ve done enormous damage to India s markets the global trust on which a booming new economy rides and indeed to our still very adolescent capitalism And please don t say this talk is nonsense that no such thing would ever be possible The scar of the retrospective Vodafone amendment on global trust in India is still to heal fully We have to be grateful that such ideas aren t floating around now Also Read How retrospective restraint prevents Pranab Mukherjee from saying he was a winner or loser Essential to the embrace of capitalism is the acceptance of the fact that losses are as much a part of business as profits Nobody can pass a law mandating only profits in the markets That s why mutual fund sellers keep repeating that statutory warning Mutual fundequity investments are subject to market risks It s also because these investments involve risk that governments tax capital gains on equities and equity mutual funds at lowerthannormal rates The lesson for common folk therefore is not to get irritated when that statutory caution is repeated in so many advertisements between overs during your T20 live telecast Losses are as much a part of the market as profits Hindenburg has only underlined to us that you can also make profits from losses if you re a shortseller with nerve  and information The reason the market particularly one as large and spread out as India s is so powerful is that it can never be identified with any individual Not one not many not even a cohort Think of it as a mob of anonymous moneyed millions There is safety in numbers Which is further fortified by that oneline ideology that governs the market I love my money People can follow this god or that vote for one party and detest another love one football or IPL franchise and hate another But they will never let any of this affect their choices on the market The only thing that matters here is my money  Of course I can make the wrong choices but never because of my politics religion or loyalties This is what makes money the most secular god of all Which in turn makes the market the most powerful monarch At least in the world of capitalism If you are in the market  never mind whether as a corporate conglomerate broker banker or even an ordinary day trader or investor  understand the fundamental law that applies May you be ever so high the market is above you In this round the market has won But it is still for Adani now to decide whether he has lost or not Accepting defeat would mean continuing to fret and fight with the market with money or other clout finding shelter underneath the supposedly ulterior motives of the shortseller The other way would be to take the blow with humility as a bad day in the market Focus on the many good and bounteously cashyielding businesses and assets more sharply rebuild what just got broken and hope that the market will love you again in the course of time This would be good capitalism Also Read If Modi wants a real legacy he must undo Indira Gandhi s disastrous bank nationalisation,This is the toughest stress test for Indian capitalism in our independent historySince the expansion opening up and modernisation of Indian markets began in the summer of 1991 many crises have struck it periodicallyBut there are five crucial differences between these and now None of these crises arose when the Indian markets and economy were globally integratedAnd

that shape the narrative which is dangerous Further the Minister opined that people like Soros start questioning the democratic setup when the electoral outcomes are not according to their liking People like him think an election is good if the person they want to see wins and if the election throws up a different outcome then they will say it is a flawed democracy and the beauty is that all this is done under the pretence of advocacy of open society he added  Mr Soros is an old rich opinionated person sitting in New York who still thinks that his views should determine how the entire world works such people actually invest resources in shaping narratives EAM Dr S Jaishankar pictwittercomk99Hzf3mGK  ANI  February 18 2023 This is days after HungarianAmerican billionaire George Soros accused PM Modi of crony capitalism and of being complicit in the supposed misdealings of the Adani Group On February 16 Soros claimed that PM Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies and that their fate is intertwined He made the contentious remarks at the Technical University of Munich TUM in Germany ahead of the Munich Security Conference Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market but he failed Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards the American billionaire alleged He also claimed that the shakedown caused to the Indian

Foundation which started its operations in India first in 1999 by offering scholarships and fellowships to pursue studies and research at Indian institutions Soros has made great strides in creating disorder within India In the name of running philanthropic activities the leftwing international organisation led by Soros has begun to spread its tentacles across the country through his active support to antiIndia elements operating inside India In the last few decades George Soros has time and again shown his desperation to wage war against the nationalist government in India through various networks funded by him comprising NGOs media intelligentsia etc In January 2020 he also committed 1 billion to start a global university to fight nationalists and climate change calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilization While speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos Soros pledged to fund a university project to battle the erosion of civil society in a world increasingly ruled by wouldbe and actual dictators and climate change Soros also claimed back then that the biggest and most frightening setback was in India as he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of creating a Hindu nationalist state Recently he made statements against PM Modi accusing him of crony capitalism and of being complicit in the supposed misdealings of the Adani Group This is after the USbased investment research firm Hindenburg Research published a 32000word report accusing the Adani Group of stock manipulation and use of tax havens The Adani Group trashed the

is one of the largest private sector airport operators the secondlargest operator of coal mines after CIL Coal India Ltd it has mines in Indonesia,None,Adani row Journalist mentioned in Hindenburg report speaks up,Paranjoy Guha Thakurta breaks his silence twoandahalf years after a court in Ahmedabad issued a gag order asking him not to speak or write anything that may go against the interests of Adani Group Guha Thakurta said he was not willing to hazard a guess on the future of the Adani conglomerate He said his response to the questions posed by The Telegraph only stated facts Paranjoy Guha Thakurta the journalist who found prominent mention in the Hindenburg Research report that triggered turmoil in the share prices of the Adani Group and cast international glare on Indian probity in corporate governance breaks his silence twoandahalf years after a court in Ahmedabad issued a gag order asking him not to speak or write anything that may go against the interests of the Adani Group I do not want to commit contempt of court I have only given you facts Guha Thakurta told this newspaper on Sunday Excerpts from the conversation follow Q What piqued your interest in the Adani conglomerate Guha Thakurta I started writing about the Adani Group because I write about the corporate sector the economy  my area of interest as a journalist is political economy  I have been a journalist for 45 years and I am now 67 years old The rise of the Adani Group has been truly spectacular Very few people had heard about the Adani Group even 20 years ago Until 10 days ago he was the world s third richest man Asia s richest man Now he s fallen off from that perch after the shares of his listed companies crashed So if the rise of the Adani Group has been spectacular the fall has been even more spectacular Very few of us including myself could ever have imagined before the Hindenburg Research report came out on January 24 that the Adani Group would not continue to rise Q What sets the Adani Group apart from many other Indian corporates Guha Thakurta What is truly out of the ordinary is the manner in which the Adani Group exercises dominance over so many sectors and segments of the Indian economy It is the largest commercial port operator in India It operates a dozen ports along the west and east coast of India Internationally it has the Haifa Port in Israel and Abbot Point in Australia Adani is one of the largest private sector airport operators the secondlargest operator of coal mines after CIL Coal India Ltd it has mines in Indonesia and in Australia It is the single biggest importer of coal to India the secondlargest generator of electricity from coal after NTPC The Adani Group also used to be the biggest aggregator of cut and polished diamonds 15 years ago  it divested this interest to others including Winsome Diamonds of Jatin Mehta who is the fatherinlaw of Vinod Adani s daughter Vinod is Gautam Adani s brother Jatin Mehta is currently outside the country Winsome Diamonds happens to be one of the largest nonperforming assets Q When did you first write about the Adani Group Guha Thakurta My article in 2015 was by and large a compilation of materials that were already in the public domain The first article that one may call exclusive appeared in April 2016 by when I was the editor of the Economic and Political Weekly EPW I wrote several articles in the EPW including on allegations of misuse of benefits by the cutandpolished diamond business of the group about the pricing of power The last article I wrote for the EPW in June 2017 pertained to the changes in the rules concerning power projects in SEZs special economic zones It also talked about how the government  the ministry of finance and the ministry of commerce  were processing an application for a refund of customs duties in excess of Rs 500 crore without first checking whether the duty had been paid The matter reached Parliament Q You stepped down from the EPW shortly after this Guha Thakurta As you know I resigned in July 2017 after the board of trustees of the EPW said I should not be writing articles in my name because that s what my predecessors had done I was told they were thinking of appointing a coeditor that I had destroyed the ethos of a prestigious publication which is like an institution I was told that I had done an act of grave impropriety by engaging the service of a lawyer pro bono to respond to a legal notice that was served to the publisher printer writer and the editor of the article And finally I was told to take the article down and not to leave the room until the article was pulled down I called a colleague of mine pulled down the article got hold of a piece of paper and wrote out my resignation Q But you continued to write on the Adani Group Guha Thakurta The article taken down by the EPW was published by The Wire the news portal Several people came out in my support including Professor Amartya Sen and renowned scholar Noam Chomsky Afterwards my articles on the Adani Group by and large appeared in other publications notably NewsClick I became a consultant with NewsClick in May 2018 Q Isn t there a gag order against you Guha Thakurta I am the only citizen of India against whom lawyers representing companies headed by Gautam Adani have instituted six defamation cases that are currently pending in the courts of law Two of the cases are before the first class judicial magistrate at Mundra in Gujarat two in courts of Ahmedabad Gujarat one in Baran district in Rajasthan and one in Delhi In September 2020 the courts in Ahmedabad issued a gag order on me my coauthor Abir Dasgupta and NewsClick headed by Prabir Purakayastha that we cannot speak say or write anything that goes against the interests of Gautam Adani and his conglomerate There was an article which was considered to be defamatory  the contents of the article were not challenged The headline was deemed to be defamatory It was the last of the series of three articles The allegation against me my colleagues and NewsClick was that we have lowered the esteem of the judiciary in the eyes of the public The case is currently pending and I cannot say anything more on this Recently in the Rajasthan case several of us appeared before the magistrate at the Grameen Nayalay in Baran district to provide bail bonds and sureties for the bail bonds The article which was pulled down by the EPW was challenged by the Adani Group saying it was defamatory Cases were moved against the entities that run The Wire my coauthors and myself It went to a civil court in Bhuj and to a criminal court in Mundra But now both are in Mundra Q Was there any attempt to arrest you as mentioned in the Hindenburg report Were you jailed Guha Thakurta In January 2021 while the pandemic was on a nonbailable warrant of arrest was issued against me by a firstclass judicial magistrate in Mundra My lawyer argued that this nonbailable warrant was bad in law He referred to the judgments of the Supreme Court where it was written that if a person fails to appear in court you can issue a bailable warrant If that person still does not appear the court can issue a nonbailable warrant This case relates to the article pulled down from the EPW and published by The Wire later In May 2019 before the results of the Lok Sabha elections were announced the Adani Group withdrew the cases against everybody  The Wire my three coauthors but I am the only person against whom the case continues To answer your question I was never arrested Q Did you collaborate with Hindenburg Research Guha Thakurta I never heard of it before the report came out However the report which consists of 32000 words if printed as a book can run into 150 pages It makes several references to the work done by me and independent journalists like Abir Dasgupta who I collaborated with But they must have accessed the materials which are in the public domain Q Do you feel vindicated today after the Hindenburg Research report came out Guha Thakurta Yes I do Q Have you met Gautam Adani Guha Thakurta I met Gautam Adani on two occasions  May 2017 in Mumbai and then in February 2021 I had a long telephone conversation with him very recently But on each of these occasions I met him on conditions that it would be off the record I did not record those conversations During each of the conversations except for the telephone call there were people with me A former colleague was with me in 2017 and in 2021 there were five of us in the room including Gautam Adani and my wife The first meeting lasted for about an hour while the second one lasted one hour and 55 minutes to be precise The phone call lasted about 15 minutes Q Did you initiate the interaction Guha Thakurta The first meeting took place at my behest The second one was by my lawyer Anand Yagnik who arranged it with the expectation that an outofcourt settlement could be arrived at But that did not happen The last phone call was a request from me to withdraw the cases Q What was his response Guha Thakurta He was noncommittal The cases are still pending as we speak Q Since you have written a number of articles against top companies and conglomerates have you faced court cases before Guha Thakurta Many corporates have sent legal notices but nobody has actually taken me to court Legal notices were sent by lawyers representing corporate entities headed by both the Ambani brothers Subrata Roy of Sahara never took me to court either Q These cases must have taken a toll on you Guha Thakurta Yes these cases do have an impact on me and my life Takes up time and involves expenditure But if you ask me if I would have done anything differently I would say no ,Very few people had heard about the Adani Group even 20 years agoSo if the rise of the Adani Group has been spectacular the fall has been even more spectacularVery few of us including myself could ever have imagined before the Hindenburg Research report came out on January 24 that the Adani Group would not continue to riseQ What sets the Adani Group apart from many other Indian corporatesQ Since you have written a number of articles against top companies and conglomerates have you faced court cases before,Not Available,"['hindenburg', 'gautam', 'adani', 'article', 'mentioned', 'report', 'row', 'group',

alleged that Gautam Adani the chairman of Adani Group had misused the system to acquire many businesses The government Moitra said should launch a thorough probe as the countrys reputation and financial stability were at risk Also read Adani Ports considering Rs 5000cr debt repayment by March 2024 Karan Adani Speaking in the Lok Sabha Motira said an investigation by the market regulator Sebi was ongoing but Adani Group put out a statement saying it had been exonerated by the highest court of the land Which court Which nation she asked The parliamentarian further said that Gautam Adani in his response to charges by Hindenburg said his brother had no formal designation in the group so any transactions with his brother and entities controlled by him not be disclosed as related transactions Also read Fitch Moodys say Adani crisis unlikely to pose credit risk for Indian banks Why has Sebi been the silent operator Why would they permit a Rs 20000 crore FPO without submitting an investigation report Why didnt Sebi ask whether bankers had signed off on the valuation Hows Mr As sons fatherinlaw allowed to be on the Sebi committee on insider trading and corporate governance How Moitra asked while firing a barrage of questions at the government What about the DRI what about customs What about GST What are they doing This is the deception of the highest order the TMC MP asked Adani she alleged has been permitted to use LIC SBI and the PSU banks to get money as and when he liked She said LIC already had Rs 36000 crore exposure to the group and the SBI had an outstanding loan of Rs 27000 crore Why were they again anchor investors in FPO she asked Last month Adani Group launched Rs 20000 crore FPO Followon Public Offer For the first few days the response was tepid due to the adverse report by Hindenburg and the subsequent stock plunge However the issue was subscribed fully by the closing day The next day markets crashed further wiping off significant money of new investors in just a day Rocked by the market volatility the conglomerate called off the FPO saying it would not be morally correct to go ahead with it Today Moitra alleged that the government tweaked rules to favour Adani Odishas Dhamra LNG Terminal was not awarded by tender And even if it is awarded by tender rules are tweaked to favor him Gautam Adani For example when he won six airport tenders the Airport Authority of India delayed the handover for three airports He invoked force majeure unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract and they

disprove and discredit the report The fact that they failed to only reaffirms,2023-02-08 05:13:24+00:00,Hindenburg showed skin in the game with report on Adani It can t be dismissed as suspect ,Nearly 4000 years ago King Hammurabi of Babylon established Law 229 which said that if a builder builds a house and it collapses causing the death of the resident then the builder shall also be put to death Hammurabi posted his set of laws in a public square for every literate person to read and believed this law was necessary to ensure highquality construction in his empire Author Nassim Nicholas Taleb cites this nugget of history to explain his philosophy of skin in the game  an ethical principle of symmetric incentives It is a seemingly simple but intuitively hardtograsp idea of an equal share of risks and rewards for all stakeholders in a transaction The ongoing Hindenburg  Adani saga can be viewed through this prism to explain some of the confusion and scepticism ascribed to Hindenburg s motives Hindenburg Research a USbased shortseller published a voluminous research report that cast severe aspersions on the Adani Group s operations and claimed in a shrill manner that Adani was the biggest con in corporate history But they didn t stop there they also revealed that they had placed a big bet against the shares of Adani Group and stand to gain if the shares drop in value And the implied corollary that they would lose all their money if they were proven wrong and the shares did not fall In essence Hindenburg put their money where their keyboard was Senior political leaders public commentators and even economics professors in ivy league universities have questioned Hindenburg s motives and argued that the report is just a facade to drive the price down and gain profits They argue that Hindenburg published a fallacious and exaggerated report because the short seller made a bet against Adani shares and is not indulging in some act of investor protection So was Hindenburg s revelation of its ability to profit from the report a case of skin in the game or skewed motive Also read Gautam Adani news overshadowed even the Budget The saga has just begun How Hindenburg shook Adani Let us suppose that a pure research entity or a media publication released the exact same findings Their veracity would have still been questioned and perhaps dismissed even more quickly as a vested shootandscoot operation because these were mere agencies with nothing to lose but something to gain from the report In fact there have been several reports by research shops or media stories in the past that have highlighted some of the very same issues that Hindenburg has raised about the Adani group Those were waved away nonchalantly either through intimidation with the threat of a lawsuit or labelling them as easily motivated operations Hindenburg s transparent disclosure that it stands to gain financially if its report was taken seriously or lose if it wasn t created symmetric incentives that established the credibility of the report It was a signal to the market that they believed so strongly in the quality of their research that other Adani shareholders would be convinced to sell their positions and hence the stock price would fall In Talebian terms Hindenburg had skin in the game in this transaction Hindenburg could have chosen one of many options in this case 1 Publish a report without betting against the share price 2 Bet against the share price without publishing a report 3 Publish a report take a bet but do not disclose their short bet against Adani shares 4 Publish the report bet against the shares and be transparent Options three and four satisfy the skin in the game condition but option four also signals to the rest of the market about Hindenburg s skin in the game  which was the option it chose Also read How to survive a bear attack  lessons for Adani in Ambani s stock market victory in 1980s Hindenburg s report not suspect To be sure I am not for a moment arguing that markets are perfect and cannot be manipulated by mischievous reports If any I believe markets are more often imperfect than perfect But to argue that Hindenburg s motive is suspect because it stood to profit misses the entire notion of symmetric incentives because it also stood to lose its money if the market did not believe its report Adani Group had the opportunity to disprove and discredit the report and cause a lot of financial ruin to Hindenburg The fact that they failed to only reaffirms the veracity of Hindenburg s findings at least before the market It is common practice in the world of finance for investors to buy shares of a certain company and subsequently talk up that company in public to let the world know so that they can benefit from a rise in its share price This is an accepted norm and it is left to the markets to either believe or disbelieve the greatness of that company No one questions the motives behind this established practice But even erudite people seem to struggle to accept the flip side of the same practiceto talk down a company in public and bet against its shares The idea that one can profit from a fall in the share price seems to be far more challenging to comprehend and accept for most people than the idea of profiting from a rise in the share price This asymmetry of the human mind has been researched and documented in great detail by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman and Israeli mathematical psychologist Amos Tversky who called it loss aversion  Ethical philosophers may justifiably argue that it is worse to profit from someone else s misfortune than from their fortune hence the two cannot be equated But that is beyond the scope of this discussion Betting against a share or short sell establishes symmetric incentives that are more credible It is nave and fallacious to argue that a short sale induces perverse incentives but a long sale does not The fact that Hindenburg could lose money if its report was wrong or rebutted easily was actually the biggest signal of its credibility Arguably the exacerbated problem of fake news in the modern world is at its core a problem of asymmetric incentives where there is no punishment but ample reward and encouragement for false reportage in the guise of free speech Establishing symmetric incentives like in the Hindenburg example can be a solution to stem the fake news malaise in society But in this specific case Hindenburg s skin in the game act removed Gautam Adani s skin metaphorically Praveen Chakravarty is a political economist and a senior office bearer of the Congress party He tweets Views are personal Edited by Zoya Bhatti,The ongoing Hindenburg  Adani saga can be viewed through this prism to explain some of the confusion and scepticism ascribed to Hindenburg s motivesSo was Hindenburg s revelation of its ability to profit from the report a case of skin in the game or skewed motiveOptions three and four

in the share price seems to be far more challenging to comprehend and accept for most people than the idea of profiting from a rise in the share priceBut in this specific case Hindenburg s skin in the game act removed Gautam Adani s skin metaphorically,Praveen Chakravarty,"['hindenburg', 'price', 'dismissed', 'incentives', 'adani', 'report', 'game', 'shares', 'showed', 'share', 'cant',

Adani companies and we have reduced in some of the others So we have very very little exposure compared with what you would have expected us to have Nicolai Tangen told UKs Financial Times Adani Group stocks have been facing intense volatility ever since US short seller Hindenburg Researchs January 24 alleged improper use of offshore tax havens and concerns about high debt which Adani denied but the subsequent market meltdown has led to a dramatic and sudden fall in group chairman Gautam Adanis fortunes The oil fund reduced its positions in Adani companies because of risks such as potential corruption environmental damage and human rights abuses Tangen had said It s a complex situation We have a separate department that is looking at riskbased divestments    We started to look at this a long time ago and so we have taken a lot of exposure out The oil fund which usually owns on average 13 per cent of a stock had holdings at the end of 2022 of 03 per cent in Adani Ports and Special

413page Response To Report Issues Fresh Statement,US short seller Hindenburg Research has rejected Adani Groups charge that its report was an attack on India saying a fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism or a bloated response that ignored response to key allegations Commenting on the 413page response Adani Group released late on Sunday evening in response to its report Hindenburg said it believed India was a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future and it was Adani Group which was holding it back through systematic loot Hindenburg stood by its last weeks report that said its twoyear investigation found Adani Group engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades Hindenburg said the response by the conglomerate run by Asias richest man Gautam Adani opened with the sensationalistic claim that we are the Madoffs of Manhattan Adani also claimed we have committed a flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws Despite Adanis failure to identify any such laws this is another serious accusation that we categorically deny it said Adani Group had on Sunday evening likened the damning allegations levied by Hindenburg to a calculated attack on India its institutions and growth story saying the allegations are nothing but a lie It said the report was driven by an ulterior motive to create a false market to allow the US firm make financial gains by dragging stock prices down The document is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and concealed facts relating to baseless and discredited allegations to drive an ulterior motive This is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities to enable Hindenburg an admitted short seller to book massive financial gain through wrongful means at the cost of countless investors it had said questioning the credibility and ethics of Hindenburg Hindenburg responded saying Adani Group predictably tried to lead the focus away from substantive issues and instead stoked a nationalist narrative Adani Group has attempted to conflate its meteoric rise and the wealth of its Chairman Gautam Adani with the success of India itself it said We disagree To be clear we believe India is a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future We also believe Indias future is being held back by Adani Group which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation Stating that a fraud is fraud even when its perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world it said Adanis 413page response only included about 30 pages focused on issues related to the report The remainder of the response consisted of 330 pages of court records along with 53 pages of highlevel financials general information and details on irrelevant corporate initiatives such as how it encourages female entrepreneurship and the production of safe vegetables it said Our report asked 88 specific questions of Adani Group In its response Adani failed to specifically answer 62 of them Instead it mainly grouped questions together in categories and provided generalized deflections It thereafter went on to reiterate its allegations and how Adani Group has failed to respond to them The report by the tiny New York firm that specialises in short selling led to Adani Group losing more than USD 50 billion in market value in just two trading sessions last week and Adani himself losing in excess of USD 20 billion or about onefifth of his total fortune In the report Hindenburg called out the conglomerates substantial debt which includes pledging shares for loans that Adanis brother Vinod manages a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities that move billions into group companies without required disclosure and that its auditor hardly seems capable of complex audit work,Commenting on the 413page response Adani Group released late on Sunday evening in response to its report Hindenburg said it believed India was a vibrant democracy and an emerging superpower with an exciting future and it was Adani Group which was holding it back through

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/adani-rise-reading-list,,None,A Journalistic History of the Adani Group,What would a brief history of India Inc look like At the time of independence India s private sector was dominated by a clutch of business families Their reign continued into the license raj years  and then was challenged by newcomers like Dhirubhai Ambani In the 1990s the country saw the flowering of a new generation of companies These were the postliberalisation firms in both new sectors like IT ITES ITenabled services healthcare and telecom as well as older sectors like infrastructure Relations between these promoters and India s political leadership covered a broad spectrum Firms operating in sectors where the government had a relatively small role  think IT  had low interaction Firms in governmentheavy sectors  like infrastructure  made larger allowances for India s political economy Some stayed equidistant from political parties donating to all Others forged opportunistic alliances with the party in power Yet others were owned covertly or overtly by politicians themselves Political patronage itself stayed opportunistic In both the captive coal block allocation scam and Arunachal Pradesh s hydelscam firms willing to pay trounced more established rivals and bagged coal blocks and hydel MoUs This was broadspectrum crony capitalism As this reporter has written earlier Companies with political links got what they wanted And so did others All that mattered was their willingness to pay In this system it was hard to say who was in the driving seat Industrialists could get their way through bribes Politicians could determine who got the largesse With Gautam Adani India is seeing something new According to economic commentators the government has chosen his group as a national champion  and is encouraging its expansion into a clutch of sectors critical for India At the same time the financial underpinnings of the group are opaque  like its quicksilver pace of growth despite the absence of cash cows in the group shadowy investors charges of stockprice manipulation and a thick density of relatedparty transactions This combination needs to be understood How was the group chosen as a national champion Is that the right strategy for India  or could it push India closer to a pairing as described by James Robinson and Daron Acemoglu between an extractive political institution and an extractive economic institution both working for a few The latter worry is not an imagined fear Given the financial pressures to win elections India s political parties are increasingly kleptocratic As for Adani there are multiple instances of him abusing his market position In all Adani represents a new chapter in the evolution of India Inc The Wire has strung together a reading list that traces his journey towards becoming a national champion  1 The backstory In 2013 Economic Times profiled Adani describing his early days  importing plastic granules from Gandhidham upgrading into wider trading and then backwards integrating into Mundra port  and his consequential alliance with thenchief minister Narendra Modi As the paper says Modi took charge in 2001 as CM but did not want to depend on Pramod Mahajan who was managing the BJP s finances  As for Adani he wanted to grow big in a state that already had Reliance 2 Adani in Gujarat Under Modi the company saw meteoric growth in Gujarat Its record was mixed On one hand it created a worldclass port complex at Mundra On the other its growth was underpinned by state support It got government largesse as described in multiple CAG reports the SEZ at Mundra came up without an environment clearance rival ports like stateowned Kandla made a series of decisions which hurt them but benefitted Mundra one could go on The Union government run by the Congressfronted UPA at the time played along as well taking the environmental violations at Mundra port as a fait accompli 3 The first Modi term Once Modi came to power at the Centre Adani went national Scroll looked at the group s growth between 2014 and 2019  a mix of inorganic growth where Adani bought stranded assets off India s bankruptcy courts growth in existing businesses and forays into new sectors 4 How the group financed this expansion is a puzzle In 2018 for instance it announced future expenditure of Rs 167000 crore despite a net profit of just Rs 345534 crore The answer seemed to lie partially in an arrangement where the group floated new companies pledged their shares to raise money and then deployed those funds across the group  to shore up struggling firms and as equity to start more new firms Researchers in Australia too flagged similar patterns The government stayed supportive It set up a committee to ensure Adani Power did not slip into bankruptcy proceedings The group also benefited from other government decisions One instance is Adani s power project at Godda Another instance is the claim by a Sri Lankan power official that Modi had asked Gotabaya Rajapaksa to award a project to Adani A third instance is airports where rules were changed to get him in In tandem investigations into the group went nowhere  like the DRI investigation into coal imports 5 The government s preferred national champion  When the NDA first came to power business circles speculated that Modi would create five or six large business houses  to cut down on Reliance s overweening dominance in India s political economy Relations between India Inc and the government were changing See this issue of Seminar for more This looks like an excellent issue of Seminar coedited by  on statecapital relations in India  pictwittercomUfOrNsBqok  Milan Vaishnav  October 5 2020 The names of a few firms did the rounds in the first term  Vedanta in mining Dilip Buildcon in construction JSW in steel Adani in infrastructure etc By 2019 however Adani had eclipsed them all Modi began relying more on Adani using the group to meet India s global commitments on fronts like decarbonisation The group forayed into defence drones polysilicon and more In a report FT called him Modi s Rockefeller  The underpinning of this expansion however remained sizeably unclear 6 The mystery of the investment funds Then came a report from The Morning Context saying a handful of investment funds invest almost solely in Adani  most of the group s free float was with them Economic Times followed up when NSDL froze these funds accounts due to insufficient disclosure of information regarding beneficial ownership  Speculation grew that these funds had been used to drive up Adani share prices  which could then be pledged as collateral by the group 7 Enter Hindenburg In its report the shortseller sizably focused on these funds It was followed by a rebuttal from Adani late on Sunday night By Monday morning Hindenburg had released its own response Read all three documents and you will have a fairly decent sense of how the group finances its operations As things stand Hindenburg isn t the only organisation to say Adani Enterprises are overvalued Here is Hindu Businessline It steers clear of Hindenburg s report but finds overvaluation all the same 8 PostFPO Adani As this article gets written the group s FPO has been a success  retail investors stayed out but a handful of big industrialists stepped in On February 1 however Adani shares began falling once markets opened In tandem came the news that Credit Suisse will not accept bonds of Gautam Adani s group of companies as collateral for margin loans  a line of credit that lets clients borrow against the securities they hold One wonders what happens next,Relations between these promoters and India s political leadership covered a broad spectrumWith Gautam

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/energy/hindenburg-adani-green-energy,,None,Will the Hindenburg Episode Affect Adanis  and Indias  Energy Plans,In early February as the market was absorbing the immediate impact of Hindenburg s exhaustive report on Adani s alleged improprieties cabinet minister RK Singh struck a sanguine note Speaking at a press conference Singh India s minister for New and Renewable Energy dismissed concerns that the Adani Group s current crisis might hurt India s clean energy plans I have the most robust renewable energy capacity in the world and that means that I have at least 1516 large companies which are at the level of global companies he said adding It will not impact us in any way Even at first glance the minister s words seem counterintuitive Scan any part of India s energy sector  coal gas renewable energy or RE hydrogen or solar  and you will find an oversized imprint of Adani s presence Not only is the group one of the biggest RE developers in the country it s one of three firms chosen by the Indian government for the solar module manufacturing PLI The group is also an early mover into sectors considered critical by India s NDA government  like pumped storage and hydrogen For the latter it aims to be the largest fully integrated green hydrogen player in the world It s the only large firm vying with RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani to create a clean energy ecosystem in India spanning solar wind batteries and electrolysers For this reason India needs a more careful answer to the question reporters had asked Singh Given the shortselling attack what happens to the group s cleanenergy plans What does that mean for India s own lowcarbon ambitions There are no easy answers to these questions The Adani Group has grown sizeably in recent years by borrowing against its pledged shares and bonds What we are seeing right now is a battle over the worth of these instruments  is it in line with the value they intend to secure Take the recent price movements of shares of Adani s crown jewel Adani Enterprises for instance In December 2022 its share s value stood at Rs 4165 On February 3 10 days after Hindenburg s report its share slipped below Rs 1050 before climbing back by February 8 to Rs 2200 In the week since it has once again fallen by 20 and stands at about Rs 1750 at the time of publishing Other group companies have traced similar trajectories It remains unclear what their real value is Two economic commentators  veteran business editor TN Ninan and academic Aswath Damodaran  found Adani shares overvalued even after falling for two weeks A similar battle is underway in bonds as well Over the past three weeks Adani bonds shed enough value to enter distressed assets territory Adani Green Energy dollar bonds due in 2024 slid 134 cents on the dollar to 616 Adani Ports  Special Economic Zone notes due in 2031 fell 52 cents to 632 A clutch of large financial institutions including Credit Suisse CitiGroup and Standard Chartered announced they wouldn t take Adani bonds as collateral In tandem however firms specialising in distressed bonds have picked up 1 billion worth of Adani s overseas bonds Given that this repricing is still underway it s hard to surmise how the group s future borrowings will change and the attendant implications for the group s plans Adani s climate footprint Seen through a climate lens the group has four deeply consequential verticals Foremost is the coalbased vertical This started with power plants before integrating backwards into coal imports coal mines coal mining and ships and integrating forwards into transmission lines and DISCOMs Today as CarbonCopy reported two years ago Adani and NTPC are the only thermal power producers in India that straddle the entire thermal power value chain from coal mines to DISCOMs Next up is the gasbased vertical Through separate partnerships with Total and IOC Adani has been picking up city gas distribution contracts to supply CNG to vehicles and piped natural gas to homes and industries Then there is the renewable energy vertical with substantial capital tied up in wind solar and pumped storage projects And finally there is ANIL Adani New Industries Limited Shortly after Mukesh Ambani announced Reliance s Rs 75000 crore clean energy push four gigafactories to make solar modules batteries electrolysers and fuel cells Adani Group made a matching claim ANIL would house its equivalent push into renewables green hydrogen and renewables manufacturing  wind turbines solar modules electrolysers The group is not shy of ambition for all four verticals In coalbased power it is developing seven new coal mines adding two new thermal power plants trying to add another 11000 km to its existing 20000 km by 2030 trying to acquire stateowned DISCOMs plus acquire power distribution licences in large markets like Delhi and Mumbai and chalking up investment plans for each In gas it has picked up 52 city gas distribution bids and aims to cover 15 of India s population by 2030 In renewables Adani Green s operational and underconstruction assets add up to 204 GW The group wants to amp this up to 45 GW by 2030 For ANIL investments have been pegged at 20 billion Rs 160000 crore over the next 10 years Elsewhere even larger numbers have been cited In June 2022 group chairperson Gautam Adani said the group and Total will jointly invest 50 billion Rs400000 crore over the next 10 years on green hydrogen alone As boggling as these numbers are they are a part of a larger thrust Adani has equally ambitious projections for most of its nonenergy verticals as well  data centres ports airports cement road projects defence drones manufacturing electric commercial vehicles alumina steelagricultural logistics and trading Its ambitions for packaged foods edible oils and media seem relatively more prosaic In all the group pegged its total investments at about 107 billion 856000 crore over the next 10 years In its cover story last December on Gautam Adani India Today posited even higher expenditure Adani Enterprises it said plans to spend 104 billion over Rs 86000 crore as capital expenditure till 2024 In the following five years from then on the capex would be 49 billion around Rs 4 lakh crore This power and energy complex features heavily in Hindenburg s report Chief among a clutch of improprieties alleged by the short seller is the charge that the Adani Group has used a web of obscure investment funds located overseas that it controls to sidestep thresholds of shareholder requirements in order to be eligible for being publicly traded  and project an image of regulatory compliance The group as is known has borrowed heavily to support its growth plans According to Hindenburg the group has propped up this debtheavy model by inflating its share prices while cash flows have remained low relative to the debt eddying around the group Shares of Adani Power Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy all heavily implicated in the report have at the time of writing shed 46 61 and 66 of their value since the report was released on 24th January Adani Power stocks have been on a skid since they hit an alltime high of 432 in August 2022 and have lost twothirds of their value since What are the fallouts A time to tighten belts Over the past five or so years the nature of Adani s borrowings has changed The group has pivoted from bank borrowings to fundraising through international bonds For the next five10 years a senior executive with intimate knowledge of the group s financials had told this reporter in 2019 the global bond market will be the most important market for the group  That has come to pass By October 2021 the group had become the biggest issuer of offshore bonds from India In December 2022 as Gautam Adani told India Today Indian banks share in the group s total lending had come down to just 32 Almost 50 of our borrowing is now through international bonds he said Breakdown of top 5 group companies debt Source CLSA India This model  of raising money through international bonds  is in trouble In the immediate wake of the Hindenburg report Adani bond prices fell steeply slipping into distressed territory Take Adani Green Bonds worth 750 million issued by Adani Green Energy are currently yielding a whopping 31 in international secondary markets well past the average 84 for global junk bonds wrote Bloomberg With other Adani bonds posting similar slides Credit Suisse CitiGroup and Standard Chartered said they would not accept Adani bonds as collateral That was followed by a recovery as investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase pointed at the value of the group s underlying assets In tandem distressed asset funds bought close to 1 billion 8000 crore worth of Adani bonds To put that number in perspective however the group s debt exposure in bonds stands nearly 14times higher at 110000 crore Put these developments together and you will see the bond market shrinking for the group Some investors will likely exit and make way for new borrowings but at a higher cost The company s shares are in trouble as well They had fallen steeply in the days after Hindenburg s report came outand then staged a shortlived recovery As this article was being written Moody s downgraded its outlook for Adani Green and two subsidiaries of Adani Transmission MSCI Morgan Stanley Capital Index a global equity index which represents large and midcap equity performance across all 23 developed markets cut its weightage for Adani companies In addition the group has lost some investors like Norway s largest pension company KLP which dumped all its shares in Adani Green Energy As shares lose value again the group s capacity to borrow via pledged shares will fall as well Turning to banks as The Ken wrote it s likely that any future big borrowings from Indian banks will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny In addition the group has cancelled its FPO which would have brought in another Rs 20000 crore Given this arid landscape the group says it might rely on promoter equity funding private placement and internal accruals to fund growth That is easier said than done The first hinges on the repricing that is currently underway The second might yield highcost loans As for the third the Adani group operates in longgestation infrastructure projects Most of these additionally generate modest profits To that Adani adds its own complications The company s return on invested capital has steadily declined even as it has scaled up hovering just over 3 in 20212022 wrote NYU finance professor Ashwath Damodaran in his widelyread blogpost about Adani and Hindenburg This shows in the group s numbers After accounting for fresh expansion taxes depreciation etc Adani Group companies are not left with large profits Adani Enterprises closed last financial year with a net income of 70432 crore and net profit of 475 crore Other group companies are pretty much the same In other words it s unclear if internal accruals can keep the group s expansion plans intact That is just the start Even as the group struggles to raise funds it is being squeezed for capital It has to urgently pare debt It has already faced a margin call  when lenders demanded extra collateral after the pledged equity lost value To place bonds the group will have to pay higher rates If it wants to shore up share prices in order to avoid domestic margin calls it will need capital there as well Buying back its distressed bonds will carry substantial demands for cash too A coal company or a green company On the whole it s hard to see how the group can support all the ambitious expansion plans listed above Barring dramatic improvements on the borrowing front  or a massive switch to domestic borrowing  the group will have to refocus on a few verticals and cut capex plans elsewhere It s already rethinking plans to participate in the privatisation of Concor One also wonders if the group will participate in the second round of the solar PLI Which is where the climate question comes in Can the group support its clean energy projects If not can these businesses raise funds on their own CarbonCopy wrote to the Adani Group asking for an estimate of the investible surplus with the group We also asked which parts of the business are likely to see capex cuts This article will be updated when they respond In the meantime it seems safe to assume that in the short term the group will have to focus on businesses with high returns If a 100 invested in coal imports nets greater returns than those in Adani Green the group might well invest more there In such a scenario Adani Green will have to raise its own funds The company s financials however are strained In FY22 the company had gross debt of Rs 48171 crore against total income of Rs 5577 crore and a net profit of Rs 489 crore The downgrade from Moody s won t help At a realistic valuation how much fresh money can this company raise ANIL has an even bigger problem Unlike Adani Green Energy it s a moonshot project The group was hoping to raise some money for it through the FPO  but that was cancelled Now comes the news that TotalEnergies has put its investment into ANIL on hold This project was announced but nothing has been signed  and for now it won t be signed TotalEnergies chief executive Patrick Pouyann told reporters on Wednesday It makes no sense to add more projects until there is clarity The bigger picture All of which brings us back to the question reporters asked cabinet minister Singh Will Adani s current crisis hurt India s clean energy goals If the group fails to add 45 GW in renewables by 2030 India will indeed lose And yet the larger answer is no Over the past eight years the Adani Group has been shoehorned into an array of sectors instead of encouraging new market participants For the most part this has been an inexplicable decision on the part of the Indian government If Adani was to be groomed as a national champion as some say  like South Korean chaebols or Japan s MITI  it has rushed ahead without empirically establishing whether the notion would work in India According to academician Ashoka Mody South Korea accompanied the chaebol strategy with large investments in public education India hasn t done that Nor is it clear how or why Adani was chosen not some other group Adani is now active in solar module gas LNG city gas thermal solar hydrogen ports and refineries an RE industry veteran in Hyderabad had told CarbonCopy last year Why are we not supporting new companies in each of these verticals What India has today is a chance to roll that clock back Take the solar PLI If Adani doesn t bid another firm will bag the incentive In all if Adani is forced to shrink its presence in India s green growth plans it will likely be more of a blip rather than a death knell for the country s ambitions If the group is compelled to sell some of its relatively noncore businesseslike cement steel defence or road to focus on a few verticals what India will have seen is a shortseller

rollercoaster ride for the Union government because of the spirited unity displayed by the Opposition in Parliament over allegations of stock manipulation and fraud against the Adani Group known for its proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi Opposition parties put their differences aside and coordinated strategically to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee or a Supreme Courtmonitored independent probe While a few parties boycotted the House proceedings others tactfully used the Budget Session to target the Union government for its failure to put the Adani group on a tight leash The fact that public sector units like LIC SBI and other banks invested thousands of crores in the Adani group was projected by the Opposition as a striking instance of cronyism At the same time Opposition MPs questioned the role of regulatory bodies like SEBI in keeping a check on alleged illegal financial dealings of the Adani Group even as they had been pointing out possible roundtripping and stock manipulation since 2019 The political messaging was clear For the last few years the Opposition forces have accused the PM of promoting cronyism and have held the Union government responsible for a decline in the autonomy of top regulatory and investigative bodies They found in the Hindenburg report an opportunity to strengthen their campaign against the Modi government in the runup to 2024 Lok Sabha elections Also read Adani Fracas an Opportunity to Make Finances of FamilyOwned Entities More Transparent But can the Opposition sustain the momentum Similar unity in their ranks was seen during the Pegasus expos and farmers protests Yet as elections approached the momentum fizzled out while Opposition unity came crashing down in cases where two or more Opposition parties saw in each other better rivals than partners In other instances Opposition unity could not take concrete electoral shape despite a prepoll alliance The SPBSP alliance ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections turned out to be a paper tiger The SP alleged that BSP could not transfer its votes to their candidates while SP supporters did well to honour the alliance Before that in the runup to the 2017 UP Assembly polls the CongressSP alliance also turned out to be a disaster after the grand old party bargained shrewdly to corner 100 seats despite its negligible presence In the last Bihar Assembly polls the Congress delivering its poorest strike rate despite having 50 seats to contest  a factor that eventually prevented the RJDled Mahagathbandhan from coming to power In contrast the smaller Left parties with pockets of influence settled for a smaller number of seats but delivered a commendable strike rate Similarly in their quest to become national players parties like TMC and AAP damaged the electoral prospects of the Congress in states like Goa Haryana and Gujarat The K Chandrashekar Raoled Bharat Rashtra Samiti which has been signalling a nonCongress front may be a possible addition to the pool of Opposition parties which may put its national ambitions over any united fight that could upset the BJP applecart One reason for such dissonance among the Opposition parties is their historical trajectories Most Lohiaite socialist parties fought the Congress and drew away a substantial chunk of traditional Congress supporters The same is the case with southern parties like BRS Janata Dal Secular Biju Janata Dal or the Trinamool Congress Their workers have created a niche by fighting the Congress the biggest national party in the Opposition ranks and continue to do so on the ground Also read Many Ingredients Went into the Adani Stock Price Meltdown So lastminute prepoll alliances tend to backfire upsetting leaders and workers of different parties instead of strongly uniting them The BJP has been able to take advantage of such contradictions as could be seen in the large number of influential Opposition leaders switching over to the BJP in election runups All such factors have helped the BJP improve its already dominant position despite the Opposition raising timely and pertinent issues As the PM s speech in the Motion of Thanks debate indicated the BJP is quite clear that if it can contain the Congress that is its direct opponent in over 200 seats other regional forces however good their performance may be in 2024 may not be able to prevent yet another term for Modi For real electoral unity the Congress and likeminded parties have to step beyond their personal ambitions The Congress should be able to drop its bigbrotherly posturing and pull back in favour of others in states where it has no realistic prospects while others too have to back the Congress in states where it is the primary Opposition force There is no Opposition unity without the Congress as much as there is no such thing without the regional forces The thought of postpolls possibilities can t in any way upend the prepoll factors that need immediate attention Parties like the RJD JDU NCP DMK the Left parties and even the Shiv Sena have set aside their historical differences with the Congress Now it is time for others to join the camp But for that to happen unity needs to be more organic than before Top Opposition leaders could surely unite given the exigencies they face at the moment but that may still draw a blank if they do not

test,The crisis of Indias secondlargest conglomerate Adani Group run by billionaire Gautam Adani is turning into another bad milestone for environmental social and governance ESG Stocks bearing the Adani name appear in over 500 socalled Article 8 funds that are supposed to promote ESG goals provided that the companies in which the investments are made follow good governance practices under European Union rules according to data compiled by Bloomberg As many as 80 of those exposures are through direct holdings while the remaining are mostly through funds of funds or index trackers the data shows which correct for duplicate holdings As the Adani Group companies get stripped from indexes and are put under review amid allegations of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation ESG investors are once again left wondering why a strategy intended to shield against risks such as greenwashing and bad governance  often at an extra fee  didn t protect them from the latest meltdown What are ESG funds ESG funds are investments which make investment commitment based on environmental social and governance factors A firm that makes investments in an ESG fund should be wellrun and also have a positive impact on the environment and society as well Also ESG funds seeks to benefit society and the environment while also producing financial returns ESG analysts believe that the strong headwinds faced by the Adani Group could impact access to offshore ESGlinked financing plans of other Indian firms An individual who tracks ESG investments has termed the Adani crisis as a bad omen for India s green energy ambitions In the wake of a late January report by USbased short seller Hindenburg Research the selloff in the Adani Groups seven listed subsidiaries have cumulatively lost about 120 billion in group market value in the last three weeks Funds with nearly 10 billion in assets under management tracking MSCI ESG indexes held shares in Adani Enterprises Ltd alone as per an analysis by the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute The institute has been studying the Adani Group since mid2020 In a report on Adani published on 9 February Ulf Erlandsson AFII s chief executive officer and Stephanie Mielnik its head of fixedincome research wrote Our view is that ESG investors with this unfortunate exposure should engage with their managers and potentially regulatory bodies that are better positioned to examine why this indexfund inclusion has occurred Patrick Wood Uribe the CEO of Util an ESG research firm backed by private equity and venture capital investors said the Adani debacle exposes some fundamental flaws in the approach adopted by several ESG index and ratings providers as well as portfolio managers There can be a very large mismatch with what investors are expecting when they place their money in a company or a fund classified as ESG Wood Uribe said in an interview And by offering an overly simplified view ESG ratings end up doing a disservice to investors he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg 27 of Article 8 funds meet its sustainability requirement In an effort to address such concerns the European Securities and Markets Authority has proposed enforcing minimum thresholds that would require Article 8 managers to apply stricter standards to their ESG claims A recent analysis by Morningstar Inc found that if the ESMA proposal is adopted only 27 of Article 8 funds would actually meet its sustainability requirement Adani companies were also held by 11 funds registered as Article 9 which is the EU s highest ESG classification Eight of these were through direct holdings according to an analysis by Bloomberg In order to justify an Article 9 designation under EU rules a fund manager needs to prove that a portfolio is 100 sustainable with allowances made for hedging and liquidity needs ESG fund managers are under increasing pressure to be much clearer with investors about what exactly they are offering and what it means Util s Wood Uribe said There remains a massive opportunity and a massive gap in actually meeting some of those sustainability objectives actually delivering on what investors would like to see in terms of sustainable investment Util also notes that Adani stock documents were replete with the kind of ESG verbiage that portfolio managers often look for In its rebuttal of the Hindenburg report Adani frequently cited the group s adherence to ESG principles and pointed to its adoption of multiple global ESG frameworks including the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures TCFD and Sustainable Development Goals SDGs among others Adani has denied all allegations calling them malicious baseless and a calculated attack on India It called Hindenburg the Madoffs of Manhattan referring to the late financier and fraudster Bernie Madoff ESG ratings firms meanwhile have given some corners of the Adani Group conspicuously high scores Adani Green Energy Ltd and Adani Total Gas Ltd still carry an A rating at MSCI Inc according to data on the website of MSCI Adani Transmission Ltd is rated BBB All three have lost more than a third of their value since the

with operations in commodities utilities gas and airports and one that is engaged in some of the most controversial coal mining projects in recent history including the largest openpit coal mining operation Wood Uribe said in a written analysis of the Adani group Thanks to the convoluted structures and multiplicity of subsidiaries cited in the Hindenburg report Adani has long been able to finance its dirtier operations with the proceeds of sustainable fund flows he said Asia ESG funds global market share doubles Meanwhile in Asia ESG funds have doubled their international market share

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/with-the-adani-crisis-is-narendra-modis-house-of-cards-at-risk,,None,With the Adani Crisis Is Narendra Modis House of Cards at Risk,The Adani conglomerate the business group most closely associated with Modi s India is under serious attack in the stock market following a damning report by researchers at Hindenburg the outfit that specialises in shortselling overhyped tech stocks By early Friday morning New York time Adani s group had lost 51bn in value This is a shocking blow to a business that is synonymous with the success story trumpeted by Delhi and the BJP leadership The slump in Adani shares follows breathtaking gains in recent years including some of Asia s biggest returns in 2022 The fiveyear advance in Adani Enterprises trumped even the likes of Elon Musk s Tesla Inc vaulting Adani from relative obscurity into the ranks of the world s richest people It is hard to exaggerate Adani s pivotal significance to the story of India s rise Founded in the 1980s as a commodity trading group Adani has become a conglomerate of both national and global significance In 2022 he crowned his rise to national prominence as India s businessman by acquiring the three national channels of the NDTV television network As Bloomberg reported in September Adani s rise has literally driven the indices Indian billionaire Gautam Adani s ascent to rank as the world s secondrichest person has helped fuel a worldbeating jump in the nation s stocks and bolstered their clout among emergingmarket equities Eight firms controlled by Adani s portstopower conglomerate including recent cement acquisitions have contributed more than a fifth of the 109member MSCI India Index s surge since endJune data compiled by Bloomberg show The index has outpaced Asian and emerging market peers during the period with a 12 jump Since 2020 the surge in Adani s stock price has easily topped all of the madness in America s equity markets As Mody makes clear in his forthcoming book India is Broken the rise of Gautam Adani is deeply connected not just with rise of Indian equity market but more specifically with Modi s vision  the Gujarat connection As the FT reported back in 2020 Adani s firms own everything from ports to coal mines Nation building is Mr Adani s motto and he likes to talk about helping India achieve energy security Adani s reach extends beyond India to highly controversial mega coal projects in Australia More recently the Adani group has positioned itself at the forefront of India s dramatic Green energy projects As the Economist reports Gautam Adani the group s founder and chairman whose personal fortune of well over 100bn makes him one of the world s richest people claims his companies will spend 70bn on greenery in India by 2030 With nearly 5gw of solar generation capacity as of mid2021 Adani Green Energy one of the group s divisions is already on par with Italy s Enel Green as the world s leading developer of solar energy At the same time as driving national infrastructure development Adani personifies the oligarchic linkages and rentier profits generated by licensing system for infrastructure on which Modi s growth model has heavily relied How to make sense of this political economy is one of the critical questions in India today And what will be revealed by this attack on Adani The question of India s new political economy was first posed in 2012 when analyst Ashish Gupta raised the alarm about bad debts at state banks The issue was taken up by USbased economist Raghuram Rajan when he was appointed to the Reserve Bank of India in 2014 Rajan and his colleague at ChicagoBooth Luigi Zingales cast India s problem as one of crony capitalism Rajan as Reserve Bank Governor only until 2016 Modi was elected in 2014 on a slate to overcome the corruption of the previous administration But instead the entanglement between the Gujurat business clique headed by Adani and Ambani and the Modi regime became ever more intense So intense did it become that it escaped generic categories of corruption or cronyism and put in question the historic model of India s development As the FT noted back in 2020 Some argue the concentration of economic power in familyrun conglomerates is a way to fasttrack India s economic development like the chaebol did for postwar South Korea But critics say the rapid consolidation of state assets is creating monopolies and stifling competition Is India going to move towards the east Asian model or the Russian model So far the tendency looks towards the latter more than the former says Rohit Chandra assistant professor of public policy at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi It s not clear whether India s concentration of capital will lead to the longterm benefit of Indian consumers Rupa Subramanya writing in Nikkei Asia warned that India might be sliding from crony capitalism into something more akin to the gangster model of 1990s Russia It takes courage for Indian journalists or activists to oppose the plans of the governmentindustrial and media complex Rather than either South Korea or Russia the other historic example that comes to mind as the FT noted are the Robber Barons of gilded age America Whether India s industrialisation leaves it more closely resembling the US at the turn of the 20th century when the likes of oil magnate John D Rockefeller wielded vast influence or Russia in the 1990s Mr Adani s voracious appetite for dealmaking and political instincts have ensured he will play a central role For a deepdive on the structure of Indian political economy delve into the remarkable survey by Jairus Banaji published by the Phenomenal World at the end of 2022 Against a historical backdrop that sweeps back to independence Banaji argues that the rise of groups like Adani signifies the fact that the business families who formed the mainstay of industrial capitalism in the country for a whole three or four decades after Independence have either disintegrated or have been disintegrating and will soon cease to exist as coherent entities let alone cohesive ones Judged by sales Banaji sees three leading types of corporate capital in India today whether publicly listed or privately held Adani clearly belongs amongst what Banaji calls the New Capitalists group who as he notes are the most fervent supporters of Prime Minister Modi This is the case among both bigger groups Ambanis Adani Sunil Mittal Airtel Anil Agarwal Vedanta the Hindujas and Sudhir Mehta of the Torrent Group and some smaller and less solid ones eg the media tycoon Subhash Chandra who recently lost control of his flagships with Zee Entertainment passing to Sony Reading Banaji s survey of December 2022 in light of events in January 2023 one can t help wondering whether he does not understate the particular significance of the AdaniAmbaniModi connection Banaji s focus instead is on correcting the simplistic critique of crony capitalism which implies that India might instead enjoy a level playingfield of capitalist competition Not only does this idealize relations between the state and capital elsewhere in the world But as he remarks this sidesteps the question of the governance of capital ie the relations internal to capital between management and shareholders And in particular it fails to focus on the peculiarly Indian malaise of the promoters figures like Gautam Adani either as a fraction of capital or as a class  They are the key figures in the process through which old power blocs within the Indian capitalist class are dismantled and remetabolised The new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code IBC of 2016 has created an arena in which business groups with easy access to capital amongst which the Adani s figure prominently can snap up the assets of ruined competitors Also read With Hindenburg Adani Faces His Stiffest Challenge Yet But what if the biggest promoterpoliticalcapitalist of all were to come under unsustainable pressure It is not only inequality and power imbalances that are at stake but the financial stability of the Indian economy Adani s growth has been driven by a cycle between rising equity values and corporate debt Already In 2014 Gautam Adani boasted that his deals were immensely bankable  And Wall Street has really begun to take a major interest since his turn to green energy The scale of this expansion set off alarm bells already years ago Credit Suisse warned in a 2015 House of Debt report that the Adani Group was one of 10 conglomerates under severe stress that accounted for 12 per cent of banking sector loans Yet the Adani Group has been able to keep raising funds in part by borrowing from overseas lenders and pivoting to green energy Groups that are perceived as politically connected can still tap the banks for loans says Hemindra Hazari a Mumbaibased banking analyst Against this backdrop the data in the Hindenburg report are both ominous and damning The report alleges that the stock values of the Adani Group and thus its ability to raise debt and leverage has been wildly inflated A valuation of the group at levels more typical of the market and the sectors that it is in would imply a spectacular devaluation The Hindenburg report traces the mechanisms and personal networks through which stock values have been boosted by a group of circular inside equity stakes Were Adani to find itself in real trouble there can be little doubt that the real anchor would be the state Adani s rise and the fortunes of Modi and the BJP are closely tied Unsurprisingly the opposition Congress party has leapt on the Adani issue As The Print reports Party leader Jairam Ramesh has issued a statement Stateowned banks have lent twice as much to the Adani group as private banks with 40 per cent of their lending being done by SBI Ramesh said This irresponsibility has exposed the crores of Indians who have poured their savings into LIC and SBI to financial risk Congress s standing is so weak that it is unlikely to pose a real threat A more serious risk is that the panic spreads from Adani throughout the financial markets forcing the Modi administration to make painful choices As Bloomberg reports the shock and anxiety is catching especially amongst global investors who may swiftly reevaluate their weighting of Indian assets The issues strike at the heart of the Indian corporate sector scene where a number of familycontrolled conglomerates dominate said Gary Dugan chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office By their very nature they are opaque and global investors have to take on trust the issues of corporate governance After last year s stellar performance Indian equities and any highprofile company s shares are open to downside risk of profittaking How big the risk to the Indian banking system actually is is disputed The CLSA brokerage points out that much of Adani s debt is in the form of bonds and private Indian banks are on the hook only for a small fraction of its bank borrowing But contagion is not just a matter of facts and figures It is a matter of overall risk appetite Worryingly on Friday 27 as the depth of the collapse in confidence sank in the contagion spread to the financial sector Shares of Indian banks and Life Insurance Corp of India plunged on Friday In 2019 ahead of COVID India was sometimes describes as a developing country suffering from richcountry banking problems COVID displaced those concerns to the margins With the crisis at Adani issues of financial stability come very much back to the fore Adani s group has been at the very forefront of the good news narrative that has yielded a series of decisive election victories for Prime Minister Modi As Mihir Sharma points out the Indian public is under few illusions about the extent of corruption and featherbedding what they expect from the likes of Adani and Ambani is delivery But that depends on preserving at least a veneer of financial probity and stability If the panic spreads if there are huge losses to be absorbed it is an open question which balance sheet will absorb the damage We don t know what will come next What we do know is that on Friday 27 January 2023 Gautam Adani suffered the worst financial blow ever experienced by an Asian billionaire An illtimed 25 billion share sale by the Adani group meant to fund capital expenditures and to pay down the debt of its various units hangs in the balance And much more besides Under intense external pressure will the Gujarat clique hold together Will Delhi stay loyal to Adani If it comes to a bailout will oppositional forces in India go along What price will Modi pay What might a dogfight within the BJPoligarch cabal look like Adam Tooze holds the

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/with-hindenburg-adani-faces-his-stiffest-challenge-yet,,None,With Hindenburg Adani Faces His Stiffest Challenge Yet,On January 25 Hindenburg Research released its report on the Adani Group Its contents are wellknown by now The USbased shortselling firm  with the scalps of firms like electric vehicle startup Nikola  accused the Indian conglomerate of serious malfeasances like the use of offshore investment funds and tainted brokers to boost both share prices and group earnings As this article gets written there is speculation about how the report will affect the Adani group What is certain is the impact may run significantly deeper than the huge Rs 400000 crore drop in the group s market capitalisation by the evening of January 27 With growth the group s borrowing strategy has changed By 2019 it had begun looking beyond domestic banks tapping funds from overseas mostly in the form of bonds instead That year trying to understand how the group was financing its quicksilver expansion this reporter had interviewed a highlyplaced finance executive at the group Bank funding has been quite constrained the last three years the executive said in that discussion For the next five to ten years he had said the global bond market will be the most important source of funds for the group In a subsequent email statement the company s spokesperson had said the same Global capital market is among the largest sources of funding for the group which has been part of a focused effort to reduce reliance on the banking sector This shows in the numbers By October 2021 the group had become the biggest issuer of offshore bonds from India In December 2022 in his interview to India Today group chairperson Gautam Adani said Indian banks share in the group s total lending is just 32 Almost 50 of our borrowing is now through international bonds he said This is where Hindenburg enters the picture The shortseller is not going short  betting a firm s stock will lose value  on Adani s shares Instead it s focusing on international bonds It holds as its report said short positions in Adani Group Companies through UStraded bonds and nonIndiantraded derivatives along with other nonIndiantraded reference securities  NEW FROM US Adani Group  How The World s 3rd Richest Man Is Pulling The Largest Con In Corporate HistoryhttpstcoJkZFt60V7f 1x  Hindenburg Research  January 25 2023 The announcement landed a punch By Friday evening dollar bonds of Adani Group had fallen to 77 cents to the dollar What does that mean In a general sense future bond issues by a company whose bonds are shedding value might find fewer takers Alternately it might have to pay higher interest to attract investors In the case of Adani the consequences are worth noting A closer look at Adani Here is what we know about Adani Before 2014 the group had most of its operations in Gujarat Since then however the group has posted an extraordinary expansion across the country  not only entrenching itself in the sectors where it was already present like ports and power but also carving out a strong market position in newer sectors like airports renewables cement defence data centres agriculture and others This expansion has been a puzzle Studying the group s expansion in 2018  a randomly chosen year  this reporter found the group had announced future expenditure of Rs 167000 crore that year alone despite its net profit standing at just Rs 345534 crore How has the organisation managed such growth Trying to answer that question this reporter had found an arrangement where the group floated new companies pledged their shares to raise money and then deployed those funds across the group  to shore up struggling firms and as equity to start more new firms The value of these shares says Hindenburg is inflated A clutch of investment funds with controversial managers based in tax havens have invested almost entirely in Adani companies Its report supports Indian media reports that these funds were being used to drive up Adani shares  CFO Jugeshinder Singh has labelled the Hindenburg Research report as malicious and unsubstantiated with the malafide intention of damaging Adani Enterprises upcoming FPO Read  pictwittercomk2eInezNMV  BQ Prime  January 25 2023 The second factor is group architecture Adanis key 7 listed companies have a total of 578 subsidiaries writes Hindenburg some of which are incorporated in notoriously opaque jurisdictions including Mauritius Panama and the UAE These companies says the shortseller move money onto the listed companies balance sheets in order to maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency  Given this arrangement one question comes up How does the group use the money it raises through bonds According to one media report the group uses bonds to swap existing highinterest debt with lowercost borrowings and deploys the rest for project financing  And yet in the past Adani has pushed borrowed money to other parts of the group as well For this reason the implications of Hindenburg s shortselling might have deeper impacts on the group Whether Adani s fundraising through bonds falters  or requires larger interest payments  the group will be more constrained for money What that means for the group will become clearer in the weeks and months ahead The larger question about systemic failure As things stand these events call SKS Microfinance to mind In 2010 the MFI headed by founder Vikram Akula listed on stock markets without preparing for the accompanying higher requirements on governance and disclosure Shortly after listing Akula abruptly fired his CEO and found himself saddled with a debate about governance standards at the company Adani is seeing something similar Take the investment funds which hold Adani stock Not only do these hold most of Adani s free float some are also managed by controversial individuals Alastair GuggenbhlEven Monterosa s Chairman and CEO has connections with fugitive Indian diamond merchant Jatin Rajnikant Mehta Elara Capital has a connection via Dharmesh Doshi with Ketan Parekh CyprusBased New Leaina Investments is managed By Amicorp Group which was implicated in Malaysia s 1MDB scandal Our response to Adani pictwittercom6NcFKR8gEL  Hindenburg Research  January 26 2023 As Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee wrote If Hindenburg is right then a network of shadowy operators is exerting outsize influence over India s markets from overseas in cahoots with corporate honchos back home This process has gone unchallenged by India s regulators This abdication in duty is seen in other parts of India s capital markets architecture as well Take the nowdisgraced Brickwork Ratings It normalised Adani s use of borrowed funds as equity What this shows is a capital market regulatory framework that is mostly optics Regulated entities tick much the same boxes they would in a developed market wrote Mukherjee As in the West a growing number of these requirements deal with corporate governance But scratch the surface of disclosures and unsavory characters show up That is the bigger point here Weak regulation has allowed Adani to grow unchecked But now poor regulators  and the company s own decisions  have also created room for the entry of a shortseller who thinks the company s shares are overvalued by 85 What happens next Hindenburg might not be working alone As NYMag wrote in its profile of Nathan Anderson who founded the shortselling firm For each investigation he may take on one backer The investor gets an advance look at the report that allows that party to take a short position and Hindenburg takes a cut of the profits on the trade In that sense we do not know how big a position the shortsellers have taken In Nikola they had taken over as much as 43 of the public float Two years later the company s shares were 71 down  with short sellers betting they could fall yet lower In the case of Adani one variable now is the FPO If it goes through it will improve the group s debtequity numbers  and give lenders greater comfort Much also depends on when existing bonds come up for redemption At that time the group will have to refinance them Adani Group says allegations regarding accounting issues are devoid of facts  revenue and costs of various businesses are assessed by regulators  21 of the 88 questions are based on publicly disclosed transactions pictwittercomxlgsnGhkZG  Advait Palepu  January 26 2023 The group has to regain the global bond market s confidence or look for alternatives More domestic borrowings is one possibility but as The Morning Context reported there is not much interest among domestic institutions The group could also consider tapping sovereign funds It isn t clear however if those can entirely replace the global bond market If bond prices fall steeply the group could also consider reacquiring them but that is unlikely Adani group s total gross debt last year stood at Rs 22 lakh crore With half of this coming from overseas bonds that is Rs 11 lakh crore Not an easy sum to raise while running the group as well One waits and watches,On January 25 Hindenburg Research released its report on the Adani GroupAs this article gets written there is speculation about how the report will affect the Adani groupIt holds as its report

The Wire,,,https://thewire.in/business/analysing-the-adani-debacle,,None,Analysing the Adani Debacle,It comes close to a fairytale as one starts narrating the meteoric rise and fall of the Adani Group in terms of its changing fortunes or valuations in the market I think history will reckon this as a singular event at least for India given the scale as well as the velocity of the changes  both during the spectacular ascent as well as in the downhill path ever since Hindenburg Research a short seller agency levelled serious accusations about the use of wideranging illegalities by the group The speedy route to the top The road to success began in 1999 with Adani as a trader of imported palm oil in collaboration with Wilmar of Singapore Seven key companies of the Adani group very quickly acquired ownership of most of India s infrastructure assets  including seaports highways airports data storage defence supplies and even jewellery The Adani Group s valuation according to Hindenburg Report was at 218 billion with Gautam Adani s share at 120 billion mostly through share price escalation ie market evaluation since 2020 All this leaves us with the big question as to how on earth the rise was made possible And then what all were behind the fall just like a pack of cards as several people have remarked The actual rise The rise of the Adani conglomerate was possible with the help of publicly owned financial institutions Those included first loans from publicly owned institutions SBI and LIC plus others like PNB which seemed to have readily complied by using the highpriced or overvalued shares as collateral Funding infrastructure projects mostly amounted to acquisitions of assets having long gestation periods and not greenfield projects Almost 75 of loans taken by the Group were from foreign banks and markets abroad and inflated stock prices would have greatly helped in being able to pledge shares as collateral With small or negligible sums obtained from equities and mutual funds the ratio of debt to equities crossed the safe limit of 21 The high value of the collateralised shares were allegedly manipulated by using undisclosed shell companies  most probably owned by the conglomerate as the Hindenburg Research report suggests Those possible manipulations could have ended up working as the second channel of funding for the Adanis Operations in stock trading gave a third opportunity of gathering money Use of margins provided unofficial credit sources While generally open those channels if allegations are to be believed may have proved more lucrative for the Adanis by dint of the sheer scale of their operations The rising turnover made possible adds to capitalisation and further profits These routes could have provided lucrative business for the business tycoon Fragile edifice versus real expansion That the edifice was rather fragile was the main accusation levelled by the Hindenburg Report on January 24 this year which the Adani Group has strongly denied But there has been a loss in Adani s wealth down from 120 billion on January 24 to below 50 billion less than a month later Financial gains booked in the market on transactions do not originate from productive activities in the real economy Thus stock market prosperity as can be evidenced does not necessarily generate real growth If new stocks are sold in the primary market those generate demand for real investments However when the same old stocks are resold in the secondary market no contributions are made to real investments even by pushing up the prices of stocks Thus profits capital gains on the sale of old stocks relating to a firm in the secondary market do not necessarily lead to higher prices of new stocks and to their demand as such stocks are launched by the firm The mere expectations of higher stock prices generate larger demand in the stock market The Adani Group s steady advances were transmitted to India s major stock exchanges over the last two decades But the gains remained within the financial circle often reinvested in financial assets for speculation The journey of the financial circuit subject to market confidence continued along a concentric circle which widened with rising asset prices asset incomes and capital gains Asymmetry in downturn However there remains an asymmetry and financial sector disruptions do have some impact on the real sector and real economy The explanation lies in the dual exposures of the real economy to the financial sector assets First with a drop in prices of financial assets held by the real sector having a secondround impact wealth effect via reduced real demand in the economy Second at a micro level a proportionate decline in the net asset value for financial institutions having a similar effect Linked to the rising exposure of the real economy to the financial there is evidence that the ongoing spate of output contractions and job losses in India as well as in different parts of the world does take place in the case of recurring financial crises Control fraud Let us get back to the notion of Control Fraud by the CEO or other superpredators of the financial world  in William Black s classic book The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One The four privileges CEOs ostensibly enjoy include suborn internal and external controls and pervert them into allies for example to shop for an auditor that will aid their looting The second is to optimise the company by having it invest primarily in assets that have no readily ascertainable market value  Third CEOs to convert company assets into personal funds through seemingly legitimate corporate mechanisms Fourth their unique ability to influence the external environment

philanthropist George Soros believes the turmoil at Gautam Adanis business empire may weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modis hold on the government,None,What did George Soros says about PM Modi over Adani issue,PTI New Delhi February 17 Billionaire philanthropist George Soros believes the turmoil at Gautam Adanis business empire may weaken Prime Minister Narendra Modis hold on the government  a statement which was strongly countered by BJP as an attack on Indian democracy Adani group has been under severe pressure since the US shortseller Hindenburg Research on January 24 accused it of accounting fraud and stock manipulation allegations that the conglomerate has denied as malicious baseless and a calculated attack on India While listed companies of the group lost over USD 125 billion in market value in three weeks opposition parties inside and outside Parliament attacked the BJP government for the meteoric rise of the portstoenergy conglomerate Stocks of most group firms have risen in the last couple of days Soros in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Thursday said Modi would have to answer questions from foreign investors and Parliament on allegations the Adani group is facing His speech drew sharp reactions Ruling BJP said Soros was not only targeting the Prime Minister but also the Indian democratic system This war is being mounted against India and what stands between the war and Indias interests is Modi BJP leader and Union minister Smriti Irani told reporters Everyone should condemn his remarks in one voice Soros in his speech said the turmoil at Adani may open the door to a democratic revival in the country His near 42minute speech oscillated between climate change RussiaUkraine war rumbling in the US Turkey disaster and failures in China Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies their fate is intertwined he claimed Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards Modi is silent on the subject but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in Parliament He did not offer any evidence for his claim This will significantly weaken Modis stranglehold on Indias federal government and open the door to push for much needed institutional reforms he said I may be nave but I expect a democratic revival in India His comments drew sharp reaction from the ruling establishment Kanchan Gupta senior adviser to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said the faces behind repeated regime change stands exposed Face behind repeated regime change attempts in India with collaborators paid by The Open Society Foundations stands exposed Indias enemies are many George Soros leads the pack Democracy in India is strong resilient 2024 is not too far away and Soros will eat crow again he tweeted attaching news of Soros comments Gupta went on to state that the Munich Security Conference MSS was a platform for discussing global security challenges and seeking paths to peace and stability not conflict Soros being given a platform to share his subversive regime change agenda to undermine India tells a different story about MSS he said The 92yearold investor started his speech at the conference talking of understanding the current state of affairs and finding a way to distinguish what is important from what is less so Let me start with a bold assertion While two systems of governance are engaged in a fight for global domination our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change This is a very succinct statement but I believe it provides an accurate summary of the current state of affairs he said devoting a good deal of his speech on climate change He then stated that as the founder of Open Society Foundation he considers open societies morally superior to closed ones At this point he talks of repressive states and distinguishes between open and closed societies India is an interesting case Its a democracy but its leader Narendra Modi is no democrat he claimed Modi he said maintains close relations with both open and closed societies India is a member of the Quad which also includes Australia the US and Japan but it buys a lot of Russian oil at a steep discount and makes a lot of money on it he said before turning to Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey Erdogan has much in common with Modi he said But while Modi seemed to be firmly in the saddle until recently Erdogan has mismanaged the Turkish economy and will face elections in May All his efforts are focused on winning the elections Soros thereafter talked about how Erdogan was autocratic his attempts to jail opponents and the governments slow response to the massive earthquake in Turkey He then made the comments on Modi and his links with Adani before moving on to other countries like Brazil Russia and its conflict with Ukraine US president Joe Bidens role in the war and finally to China Turning to China Xi Jinping would be an obvious loser His close association with Putin would hurt him But China may be already undergoing a revolution he said adding Xis Zero Covid policy was his biggest blunder After devoting time on talking about what ails China he turned to the US saying democracy isnt functioning very well When Donald Trump became president in 2016 he posed a real threat to our democracy he claimed Trump is a deeply flawed character a confidence trickster whose narcissism grew into a disease He hoped that in 2024 Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida would slug it out for the Republican nomination To conclude I want to repeat what I said at the beginning while open and closed societies are in a fight for global domination our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change I believe this sums up the current state of affairs accurately he added adani modi,Soros in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Thursday said Modi would have to answer questions from foreign

Singh of DLF,The turmoil engulfing Gautam Adanis business empire following damning allegations by a US short seller has not shaken the faith of global investors in India real estate doyen K P Singh said rubbishing suggestions that banks would have lent to Adani group on instructions from higherups The punishing stock market selloff Adani group companies have seen following the January 24 report of Hindenburg Research is a temporary blip concerning just one corporate group and hasnt harmed faith in India as an investment opportunity he told PTI in an interviewHe however felt the Adani group needs to beef up capital and cut down debt to continue to remain on the high growth trajectoryKnown for his plain speaking Singh cited how a Canadian firm had threatened to bring out a report when his retail estate firm DLF was bringing out an IPO oneandahalfdecade backWe said pushoff to the Canadian firm do whatever you can  he said adding there are blackmailers who bring out reports around any big share saleThe Hindenburg report that alleged accounting fraud and stock manipulation at the Adani group came just as a Rs 20000 crore followon share sale of the conglomerates flagship firm Adani Enterprises openedCompletely nonsense he said on the AdaniHindenburg row impacting Indias attractiveness as an investment destination India is too big a country today So this story will die down Investment will not be hurt Modi is a sensible and dynamic person and so long as he remains prime minister India will remain an attractive destination he saidThe applestoairport conglomerate has denied all allegations calling them malicious baseless and a calculated attack on IndiaThe Adani groups listed firm lost about USD 125 billion in market value in three weeks after the report Some recovery has been seen in the last couple of daysWhile the groups rapid expansion  from cement to hydrogen and data centres has largely been fuelled by debt funding Singh who is now chairman emeritus of DLF said suggestions that banks lent money to the Adani group because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi telling them to do so was rubbishWhat has the prime minister got to do with it lending money to a corporate No banker even if the prime minister tells anything will give money unless it is justified he saidI have no clues about Adani but if somebody thinks today that a call from the prime minister will make bankers give loan then they are living in a fools world No banker will do this thingCiting the example of former ICICI Bank chief executive Chanda Kochhar who was arrested on charges of irregularities in loans to Videocon Group  he asked Would any banker do anything which is not according to the regulations No they wontOpposition parties used the Hindenburg report to attack the government alleging Modi aided the Adani groups riseThe Prime Minister has not referred to Adani by name since the crisis triggered by the Hindenburg report but earlier this month he told Parliament that the blessings of 140 crore people in the country are my protective cover and you cant destroy it with lies and abusesSingh said Modi need not respond and should continue to do his jobSo many dogs will bark he should not respond to it System will take care They will go away He should continue doing what he is doing he saidOn the troubles facing Adani group he said entrepreneurs are risk takers but its always smart to strike a balance between equity and debtAdanis rival Mukesh Ambani has done the smart thing of balancing debt by bringing in equity investors across businessesEvery businessman goes through this thing In your zest for growth you get debt But Balance debt with equity And grow again he said adding Adani was trying to do that through the FPO of Adani EnterprisesAdani group has maintained that its debt of Rs 196 lakh crore as on September 2022 was balanced with assets it has and the revenues all the businesses are generatingAlways have a healthy balance between equity and debt At the moment Adani seems to have heavy debt So I wish him good luck I dont know but eventually he has to beef up his capital Singh said,Completely nonsense he said on

American investment firm Hindenburg Research published a report that has shaved off half the value of the Adani Group I boarded a train from Delhi to Jaipur  under the glare of Prime Minister Narendra Modi Every TV screen at the railway station in Delhi beamed images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi Photo Supriya Sharma Seated next to me on the train was a young man looking up stock prices on his phone He worked in the finance department of a private healthcare company If you look around my office during working hours you ll find everyone glued to their phones trading stocks he said Even the peons India had indeed seen a surge in retail investors during the pandemic years Had it not been for a buoyant stock market the young man said people like him would have struggled Since demonetisation salaries have stagnated inflation has skyrocketed No one is doing well he said Except Adani He smiled as if he had shared an inside joke He was a supporter of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party He had voted for the party in both the national and state elections and said he would continue to do so Comfort milta hain he said his eyes narrowing behind his glasses They give me comfort The comfort had nothing to do with Hindutva he added quickly as if reading my mind Bahut Hindu Muslim karaa rahe hai  the BJP is instigating trouble between Hindus and Muslims he said disapprovingly But Narendra Modi was working hard to attract investment into the country he claimed which would eventually raise all boats  not just that of Gautam Adani founder and chairman of the Adani Group best known as Modi s closest business ally Modi pe bharosa hai the young man said I trust Modi The protective shield Trust was the keyword in Modi s defence in Parliament last week The Opposition had sought to corner the government after the Hindenburg report which accused the Adani Group of brazen stock manipulation and fraud  triggered a meltdown that had made headlines across the world In Parliament Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reeled off a list of alleged favours the Modi government had advanced to the conglomerate  from getting public sector banks to give the group millions of rupees in risky loans to making stateowned Life Insurance Corporation invest in its firms to bending rules to award six airports to Adani unleashing investigative agencies to bulldoze rival businessmen into selling assets and armtwisting governments in neighbouring Sri lanka and Bangladesh into signing deals with Adani In 2014 when Modi became prime minister Adani was ranked 609 on the list of the richest people in the world Gandhi said Then magic happened and he reached the second rank he said Fellow MPs thumped their desks and quipped Modi hai to mumkin hai  Modi makes the impossible possible When PM Modi was Gujarat CM one man stood shouldertoshoulder with PM Modi Adani was LOYAL to the PM The result of that was tremendous expansion of his business in Gujarat The real magic began when PM Modi reached Delhi in 2014  Ji pictwittercomSjJLICFvgM  Congress  February 7 2023 The next day it was the prime minister s turn to thunder back In the Lok Sabha Modi boasted that he had the trust of 140 crore Indians  You can t penetrate this protective shield with your lies he said He did not once name Adani  nor did he respond to the Opposition s allegations Instead amid a din in the Rajya Sabha of AdaniModi bhai bhai  Adani and Modi are brothers  he raised his hands and roared The country is seeing that one man is enough to take on a brigade Is that actually the case A conspiracy of silence It isn t as if the Adani crisis hasn t already claimed a political scalp It has  in the United Kingdom The brother of former prime minister Boris Johnson stepped down as director of Elara Capital one of the firms that allegedly served as stock parking entities for the Adani Group helping it evade regulatory scrutiny according to Hindenburg The Adani Group has denied this claim In most democracies crony capitalism is a serious charge But in India it is unclear whether it can dent Modi s image For one the Opposition s chances of taking the message to voters is hobbled by the reluctance of the mainstream news media to broadcast it As Alt News reported India s major TV channels and Hindi newspapers blanked out the Hindenburg report for two whole days A day after Gandhi s speech in the Lok Sabha I bought copies of the top Hindi newspapers in Delhi Amar Ujala hadn t even considered the day s biggest political story worthy of front page space It isn t just the media India s independent regulators have chosen to maintain a stony silence even as global indices rating firms and investors have reviewed  and downgraded  Adani firms So what Yet a stock rout is impossible to hide At least from India s largely uppercaste urban middle class which despite its small size has a disproportionate sway on the country s politics It s all over my social media timeline this ModiAdani talk said Achla an IT professional I met on the Delhi metro while she was heading for a job interview But tell me who takes Rahul Gandhi seriously Most others I accosted at Rajiv Chowk Delhi s busiest metro station  named after Rahul Gandhi s father  also shrugged off the allegations So what if they are true asked Mohit a civil services aspirant from Bihar Such cooperation between the government and business groups happens all over the world Adani had built his fortunes by working hard argued Tapasya Acharya 32 He started out by cycling and selling clothes she claimed incorrectly As for Modiji he can only act in desh hit  the country s interest One young man however was scathing in his criticism Everyone knows this is a scam he said Any other businessman would have been raided by CBI ED by now he said referring to India s federal agencies the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate But nothing will happen in this case kyunki ghar ka aadmi hain  he alleged  Adani is like a member of Modi s family A chartered accountant by profession the young man did not want to be identified by name Maybe it is better not to even say I m a CA he said as he walked off Who knows this government can come after anybody A protest organised by the Congress in Kolkata last week Photo AFP A change in psychology What s helping the government tide over the crisis is that so far at least it hasn t caused much direct pain to ordinary Indians I called up LIC agents in four cities  Chennai Hyderabad Mumbai Delhi They claimed they hadn t been deluged with phone calls from clients fretting about the possibility of their hardearned money going up in smoke Only one agent Vikas Rana who lives in Ghaziabad abutting Delhi said of the 350400 clients he has two or three had called He said he assured them they had nothing to worry LIC s investments in Adani amounted to talab mein balti  a bucket in a lake In a statement issued after the stock rout the insurance behemoth said its exposure to Adani firms amounted to just about 1 of its assets under management But as the Indian Express had reported last year the key distinction was that private insurers and mutual funds which usually shadow LIC s investments into companies had stayed away from investing in Adani A financial advisor in Ahmedabad described this as the the saving grace  The middle class is invested in mutual funds which are untouched by this collapse he explained on the phone Even Rana the Ghaziabad agent who helps people invest in a range of financial products LIC policies for the lower rung  stocks and mutual funds for people like you and me  said he had made sure none of his clients had invested in overvalued Adani stocks Yet he didn t think the LIC investments were questionable At best it was a case of halka phulka foul  he said  lowkey wrongdoing He continued with a laugh Hindutva has changed the country s psychology Hum Modi ji ki baat maanna chahte hain  We want to trust Modi But it isn t just Hindutva that makes people look the other way claimed the financial advisor in Ahmedabad who did not want to be identified People are tolerant of crony capitalism he said because they believe that s the only way for India to grow Agar wo log paisa nahi banayenge to hum kaise bana payenge If they don t make money how will we Rana the Ghaziabad agent claimed that many people believed the Congress had instigated the Hindenburg report Just when the country is doing well wo log tang adda rahe hai  they are attempting to derail it The only cause of worry for the government the financial advisor in Ahmedabad said would be if the Adani fall caused a larger contagion in the stock market In 2008 there was panic selling he said People even exited good stocks But this time the market has shown maturity Does it really matter if one company went down he asked The fate of Adani s projects It is a question that those who live in the shadow of Adani Group s upcoming projects are asking In Mumbai the sprawling slum of Dharavi is being handed over to Adani Realty for redevelopment  a process that involves replacing lowincome lowslung housing with highrise buildings to free up valuable real estate for sale The Adani firm won the tender in December 2022 months after the BJP returned to power in a coalition government in Maharashtra Shakir Husain 25 who lives in a 6 by 10 feet room with his parents said he has been hearing about Dharavi s redevelopment since childhood We don t care who redevelops it We just want redevelopment he said He was hopeful the Hindenburg report wouldn t affect Adani s plans Adani still has a lot of money he said But Ghanshyam Bhapkar from Jhopadpatti Chalval association said the Adani stock collapse was a wakeup call for the government which must take back the project from the company else slum dwellers will suffer  The company is sinking he said It has committed fraud Is the government sleeping A view of Dharavi Photo Danish Siddiqui Reuters In sandswept Jaisalmer in Rajasthan villagers who fought a long legal battle against Adani s acquisition of land for a solar park said they were happy to hear about the company s misfortunes Der hai andher nahi  justice comes even if it is delayed said Bhairon Singh the former sarpanch of Nedan village While the land acquisition had started under a BJP government when the High Court struck it down in 2021 Congress was in charge We were hopeful the High Court verdict would be swiftly implemented and people would get back their land Singh said But that hasn t happened When it came to Adani he said the BJP and the Congress are the same  Adani in Opposition states The Opposition s efforts to corner Modi on Adani will be tested by the conglomerate s presence in the states it rules While speaking in Parliament Rahul Gandhi held up a photo of Modi travelling with Adani in a plane The BJP was quick to respond by circulating photos of Adani with Ashok Gehlot Congress veteran and chief minister of Rajasthan The next day I met a political consultant who has worked closely with the Congress The time has come for the Opposition to decide who it should not be taking money from he said Business groups fund political parties in India The funding details remain shrouded in secrecy thanks to the opacity allowed under the electoral bond programme The consultant claimed cashstrapped Congress had turned a blind eye to Adani money flooding Congress units in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh states where his companies have coal thermal and renewable energy projects You need money for the benefit of the party the consultant said If the money is eating up the chances of your party then you must end the deal He added it wasn t just money though He claimed Opposition state governments mistakenly believed that by helping Adani they could help stave off action by the Enforcement Directorate against their leaders They have to be ready to go to jail he said But they must seize the moment by cancelling Adani projects So far the only state to have cancelled an Adani contract after the stock collapse has been BJPruled Uttar Pradesh Tabassum

wipes out a substantial chunk of Gautam Adani s personal wealth and sees him lose his position as Asia s richest man In Australia where the Adani Group is involved in the controversial Carmichael mining project the market regulator says that it will review the Hindenburg report February 2 As the Adani empire s market losses exceed 100 billion the market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India launches an investigation into the stock crash and Hindenburg s allegations The Reserve Bank of India reportedly tells banks to provide details of their exposure to the conglomerate In Parliament the Opposition demands an investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee or a panel constituted by the Supreme Court There s Evidence That The Adani Group Likely Bought Into Its Own 25 Billion Share Sale  pictwittercomQRSF75Vyrk  Forbes  February 1 2023 Ratings downgrade The valuations of Adani s companies have rocketed over the past three years Between April 2020 and August 2022 the value of its stocks rose nearly 4000 Now that the stocks are plummeting these companies are facing a downgrade in ratings Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee points out that some of the group s securities that Credit Suisse had assigned a lending value of 75 are now rated zero This makes it difficult for the conglomerate to raise money Its lenders are either asking for more collateral or are scrutinising the value of the companies debt to lend against The American investment bank Citigroup has already stopped giving loans to the group against securities The botched share sale of Adani Enterprises has only added to this heightened scrutiny There are reports that at least two companies allegedly linked to the Adani Group underwrote and likely bought in the share sale An underwriter pledges to buy the unsold shares in a share sale These two companies were accused by Hindenburg of helping the Adani Group engage in corporate malfeasance The conglomerate denied the links The oversubscription of the Adani share sale was assisted by rich Indian individuals at the last minute after retail investors stayed away reported Bloomberg the Financial Times and The Economic Times Retail investors are individuals or nonprofessional investors Potential spillover It is not only Hindenburg that has made such allegations against the Adani Group In August 2022 American finance and insurance company Fitch Group warned that the group had taken on too much debt and raised the possibility of a default in the worstcase scenario  However the report also said the Adani Group draws comfort from its strong relationships with banks and India s government Indeed the conglomerate has been described as being too big to fail for the Indian government In December Quartz argued that any Adani company defaulting would damage not only the stock market but also the wider Indian economy The taxpayer will be hit additionally by her indirect exposure to the group through LIC and the stateowned banks the business news platform said A bailout would limit the damage That too would be funded by the public exchequer but it would be unavoidable if the government decides that the Adani Group has indeed grown too big to be allowed to fail The suggestion that the Modi government will have to act if the Adani Group needs rescuing is driven by concerns that the crisis will potentially spill over onto the Indian economy at large Not without reason The stock crash has raised concerns about the high exposure of the public insurance company LIC to the Adani group and how it could risk the savings of middleclass Indians The insurer has sought to alleviate such concerns saying its total exposure in the Adani Group companies is less than a percent of its total assets under management at book value referring to the total market value of investments that an entity controls Some commentators such as Bloomberg columnist Mihir Sharma have raised concerns about whether the Adani Group following this crisis can deliver on key infrastructure projects with which it has been entrusted Reputational damage Sharma also pointed out that one factor that distinguishes India from other emerging nations is the transparency of its markets and the quality of its market regulator This crisis he notes is challenging that image As a consequence the Modi government cannot afford to mismanage the crisis On a similar note Wall Street Journal columnist Megha Mandavia noted that the Indian government s handling of the crisis will shape foreign investors perception of the country s attractiveness  Foreign investors who hold a large chunk of the conglomerate s sizable debt may be reluctant to keep financing it until they are confident that the regulator has thoroughly assessed Hindenburg s claims she argued The British Financial Times on Monday described the crisis as a defining test for India Inc  In its daily investment column on Wednesday the newspaper said the relationship between Indian politicians and the business elite is worryingly close  However it argued India can dispel negative interpretations of such ties by investigating the Adani affair thoroughly and with extensive public disclosure ,Here s how the crisis unfolded how it might affect the Adani Group and the Indian economy at largeJanuary 26 The Adani Group dismisses Hindenburg s allegations as maliciously mischievous and threatens legal actionJanuary 29 In a 413page response to Hindenburg the Adani Group calls the allegations a calculated attack on IndiaHowever the report also said the Adani Group draws comfort from its strong relationships with banks and India s governmentIn December Quartz argued that any Adani company defaulting would damage not only the stock

state and private capital,The HindenburgAdani Enterprises faceoff is a telling tale about the volatile relationship between private capital and the Indian state Over the past few decades India s growth trajectory and the relationship between the state and private capital has shared traits with Latin America of the 1980s and Russia of the 1990s For one an adhoc probusiness policy has allowed a few companies to monopolise asset ownership Second there has been rentseeking behaviour  adding wealth without contributing to productivity  at the top with the support of the government while cutting down on competition and the entry of new firms across sectors The rise of Adani Group has helped shape that trajectory which is worrisome In addition to Adani Group headed by tycoon Gautam Adani a few familycontrolled conglomerates dominate the business scene in an opaque manner potentially undermining the resilience of India s corporate governance system and the regulatory structure Adani Group s woes began on January 25 when Hindenburg Research a US firm that conducts forensic financial research  released a report accusing the Indian conglomerate of serious malfeasance It claimed that Adani had illegally used offshore investment funds and accounting fraud to boost share prices and group earnings Hindenburg has a reputation for being an activist short seller  It borrows the securities of companies it believes are overvalued because of alleged wrongdoing anticipating that the price will fall It sells these borrowed securities hoping to buy them back later at a lower price By the morning of January 27 Adani Group had lost 51 billion in market value Over a week since the Hindenburg report was published Adani Group s losses continue to mount On February 2 the Adani Group cancelled a muchawaited fundraising exercise that had closed the previous day citing prevailing market conditions It has now said it will return the money to investors The Adani Group has shed 108 billion in market value since Hindenburg Research accused it of stock manipulation and accounting fraud in a Jan 24 reporthttpstcoXSCcKJl1d9 pictwittercomFMz4MQFKwB  MarketSaga  February 3 2023 State of private capital investment Over the past decade despite the continuous dip in domestic private investment across sectors in the country over the last decade the Adani Group has soared like no other firm in India  and perhaps Asia The fiveyear rise in Adani s stock performance and asset ownership levels have trumped even Elon Musk s Tesla and Jeff Bezos s Amazon As a consequence the Adani Group has been seen as the poster boy of India s aggressive bullish run in the equity markets This means that anything amiss with the company s stock performance or macrofundamentals is likely to affect both domestic and foreign business sentiment in India What does this unfolding situation say about the relationship between big private capital and the government in India Political economy questions Political economist Atul Kohli in his work on the politics of economic growth in India between 1980 and 2005 had a detailed insight on the dynamics of the political economy that shaped the growth trajectory during that period According to Kohli India s entry to the global economic landscape in the 1990s was a result of incremental gradual reforms of the 1980s based on shifts in the relationship between state and private business One question was central to the pursuit of Kohli s thesis did India s growth acceleration in the 1990s and 2000s result from the state s embrace of promarket policies or from a more complex but identifiable pattern of state intervention For many experts the post1991 period after the Narasimha Raoled government s economic liberalisation is viewed as part of the promarket growth trajectory According to Kohli the economic reforms of this period  undertaken more on the capital market side  allowed Indian markets to operate more flexibly in certain sectors telecom automobiles aviation information technology construction consumer goods among them with the aim of bringing in private investment opportunities From this period India saw a strengthening of the statecapitalprivate business alliance often at the cost of the social and economic protection to India s deeply fragmented labour force The AdaniNarendra Modi alliance based on a newly designed probusiness regulatory outlook emerging from the Bharatiya Janata Party s rise to power at the national level signals a similar dynamic The success of the Gujarat growth model that Modi effected as chief minister from 2001 to 2014 pivoted around the emergence of such linkages driven by large infrastructure investment from companies like Adani Group Ever since Modi was sworn in as prime minister in 2014 Adani Group s national footprint has also grown significantly Indias central bank Reserve Bank of India has asked local banks for details of their exposure to the Adani group of companies government and banking sources reports Reuters pictwittercomEHxDfVNmhD  ANI  February 2 2023 As historian Adam Tooze noted on January 28 Driving national infrastructure development Adani personifies the oligarchic linkages and rentier profits generated by a licensing system for infrastructure on which Modi s growth model has heavily relied Tooze means that the Adani Group s ability to accrue and concentrate power and generate sustained profits without substantially adding to overall productivity is anchored in Modi s growth model which emphasises big infrastructure spending The growth of Adani Group  investing in acquiring ports and airports for instance  has been driven by a cycle of rising equity values and corporate debt particularly post 2020 Some argue the concentration of economic power in familyrun conglomerates is a way to fasttrack India s economic development like the chaebol did for postwar South Korea The Financial Times had noted back in 2020 Chaebol are large familyrun business conglomerates in South Korea In the statebig business compact of New India  the extent to which conglomerates like Adani Group are exposed to banks and insurance companies financed or supported by the exchequer or tax money requires greater scrutiny Stateowned banks have already lent twice as much to the Adani Group than private banks Of these the State Bank of India the country s largest financier has given loans of as much as Rs 260 crore to companies in the Adani conglomerate Bloomberg reported The Life Insurance Corporation of India in a public clarification said its total holdings in Adani shares and debt was Rs 30127 crore while the market value stood at Rs 56142 crore after the plunge in Adani stocks as of January 27 However a few days before Adani Group s shares began plunging their market value in the Life Insurance Corporation s books was a little over Rs 80000 crore according to journalist MK Venu In just four days the Life Insurance Corporation saw a portfolio loss of about Rs 23735 crore Venu noted That is a large sum of money to lose for a company that has thousands of crores of longterm savings of average Indians pledged with it For the deeply divided and unequal corporate governance structure in India driven by an everincreasing concentration of business power and wealth inequality there is a worrying lesson in Adani s acquisition of dominant corporate power across sectors in only a few years It also exposes the structural challenges of the relationship between statecapital and private business in India where a few familycontrolled conglomerates with connections to the ruling party dominate business in an opaque manner reflecting a disregard for regulatory scrutiny or the preestablished rules of doing business

in corporate history  The report alleged that the conglomerate has over the decades been involved in stock manipulation accounting fraud used offshore shells for money laundering and siphoned money from listed companies The allegations listed by Hindenberg led to a massive drop in the prices of Adani stocks over the next few days This in turn has raised concerns over the high exposure of stateowned insurance company the Life Insurance Corporation to Adani Group companies Over the past few years LIC has invested significantly in the Adani group channeling millions of rupees of middle class savings into the conglomerate Any sharp fall in Adani stock prices will now end up affecting the returns of millions of LIC policyholders Allegations against Adani Group Hindenburg Research following a twoyear investigation made wideranging allegations of the Adani Group being involved in corporate malpractice It alleged that members of the Adani family had cooperated in creation of offshore shell entities in taxhavens such as Mauritius and generated forged importexport documents in an apparent effort to generate fake turnover and to siphon money from the listed companies The research firm also alleged that some shells seemingly served several purposes such as stock parking or stock manipulation and money laundering Short sellers identify allegedly overvalued companies borrow and sell their stocks at current market price and buy them back at a lower price in the future when the price has fallen in order to make profit To this end activist shortsellers seek to expose such a company s negative financial information This is not the first time questions have been raised about the Adani Group s business practices In August 2022 New Yorkbased finance and insurance

size and scale of LIC make it a critical variable when it comes to the Indian middle class which often depends on the company for critical products like postretirement savings LIC has a massive 250

similarly said if allegations made by Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group are correct it would destroy lives of crores of Indians who park lifelong savings in LIC and the State Bank of India ,This in turn has raised concerns over the high exposure of stateowned insurance company the Life Insurance Corporation to Adani Group companiesOver the past few years LIC has invested significantly in the Adani group channeling millions of rupees of middle class savings into the conglomerateAllegations against Adani GroupHindenburg Research following a twoyear investigation made wideranging allegations of the Adani Group being involved in corporate malpracticeIn terms of the value LIC s holdings in Adani Group companies have reportedly multiplied 10 times since September 2020Similarly in Adani Ports Adani Total Gas Adani Transmissions and Adani Green the LIC holds 914 596 365 and 128 stakes respectively,Nachiket Deuskar,"['embattled', 'explained', 'adani', 'report', 'company',

the conglomerate cannot obfuscate its fraud by nationalism We also believe India s future is being held back by the Adani Group which has draped itself in the Indian flag while systematically looting the nation Hindenburg Research said in a statement On Sunday the conglomerate issued a 413page response four days after the company published its report leading to a steep fall in share prices of Adani Group companies Over two trading sessions on Wednesday and Friday 10 listed companies of the group led by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani lost Rs 417 lakh crore in market capitalisation Adani

firm Adani Enterprises was up 65 on the Bombay Stock Exchange but several other stocks were losing up to 20 In its response on Sunday the Adani Group alleged that the mala fide intention of Hindenburg was apparent as the report was released ahead of a 25 billion share sale by its flagship firm Adani Enterprises It is tremendously concerning that the statements of an entity sitting thousands of miles away with no credibility or ethics has caused serious and unprecedented adverse impact on our investors the Adani Group said It added that Hinderburg Research by its own admission is a short seller and claimed that its aim was to book massive financial gain through wrongful means In its report Hindenburg Research had said that it holds short positions in the Adani Group companies through US traded bonds and nonIndiantraded derivative instruments Short positions are created when a trader sells a security first with the intention of repurchasing it or covering it later at a lower price

objective nor wellresearched Hindenburg Research had said in its report that markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India had investigated and prosecuted over 70 entities for manipulating Adani stocks between 1999 and 2005 The Adani Group however said that there are no ongoing proceedings before SEBI in connection with the matter and all past cases have been closed We are neither aware of nor are we required to be aware of any proceedings against these other entities and individuals  who are not Adani promoters the corporate group said Hindenburg response In its response on Monday Hindenburg Research said the Adani Group had not given specific answers to 62 of the 88 questions the research firm had posed in its report last week It mainly grouped questions together in categories and provided generalised deflections Hindeburg said In other instances Adani simply pointed to its own filings and declared the questions or relevant matters settled again failing to substantively address the issues raised The American company pointed out that Adani s 413page response consisted of 330 pages of court records along with 53 pages of highlevel financials general information and details on irrelevant corporate initiatives such as how it encourages female entrepreneurship and the production of safe vegetables  Hindenburg claimed that Adani s response had largely confirmed its

billion Rs 81 lakh crore over the last three years largely due to share prices of seven of his listed companies rising by an average of 819 during this period However Hindenburg s research said that

Ambani had beaten old school business boys Adani probably better at it The Hindenburg report may be the best thing that ever happened to billionaire Gautam Adani says Swaminathan Aiyar And what is the reason for his optimism Hear it from him In 2006 I researched and wrote a paper for the Cato Institute on Gujarats new strategy of portbased development  This strategy was launched by Congress chief minister Chimanbhai Patel in the early 1990s and expanded by BJP successors I visited Gautam Adani s new Mundra port and was struck by its high automation and speed I was astounded to hear that it financially compensated any ship that was not admitted and unloaded on schedule While working in Mumbai in 1990 I had seen ships wait 20 days for port entry So Mundra seemed to be on another planetThe Hindenburg Research report has alleged vast price rigging and fraud by Adani companies The charges are serious Global investors have stampeded out of Adani shares We need a thorough investigation and punishment of the guiltyLet me raise a separate linked issue Adanis critics say he shot to riches not through skills but manipulation and political favours minting money in cosy monopolies I disagree Going from humble origins to global No 3 in two decades is impossible without exceptional business skillsCritics accuse BJP of giving Adani valuable assets  from ports and mines to airports and transmission lines No What the government initially gave Adani was the right to operate a minor port in the Kutch desert without even a rail connection To convert this desert patch into Indias largest port is close to miraculousAdani has also acquired jetties and ports in a dozen other locations beating global giants like Maersk and Dubai World in competitive auctions He is incomparably Indias top port operator handling an estimated quarter of total Indian freight This makes him a national championSo GoI is backing him to acquire strategic jetties and ports in Sri Lanka and Israel Critics call this a favour Really The Sri Lanka terminal will cost 750 million and Haifa Port 118 billion No Indian rival would dare risk so much even if offered on a platter Adanis skills have made him a strategic player more than just a businessmanA port is no cosy monopoly It has to compete in logistics and pricing to woo ships from established rivals Mundras logistics have attracted business investments of thousands of crores creating an industrial hub in the desert It has the worlds largest automated coalhandling facility A 2017 Morgan Stanley report puts Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone APSEZ in the top 25 of global port companiesCritics focus on government favours to Adani In India business success requires good management of not only factories but politics too All businessmen cosy up to politicians But while this opens doors and overcomes some rules it cannot guarantee success Anil Ambani is often accused by Rahul Gandhi of getting 30000 crore in defence deals Yet he has flopped commerciallyOnce Dhirubhai Ambani was also accused of political manipulation and boondoggles He responded What have I done that every other businessman has not There was no reply Other businessmen many with formidable historical advantages had also wooed politicians and fiddled books For a newcomer like Dhirubhai to beat the old giants at their own game signified immense talent Something similar can be said of AdaniDhirubhais dubious acts are detailed in Hamish McDonalds 1998 book The Polyester Prince But critics are dead wrong to think that he was just a successful manipulator During the licencepermit raj manipulation was inescapable But once the economy was liberalised he built the worlds largest exportoriented oil refinery with operating margins higher than even Singapores famed refineries proving himself world class He got favours in telecom but created the cheapest telephone network in the world Those who focus only on his manipulation are blind to the phenomenal skills that made him a historical titan  warts and all Adani is treading a similar pathCritics say Adani deals mainly in infrastructure where cosiness to the government matters more than true skills No Dozens of new tycoons with strong regional political clout joined the infrastructure boom of 200308 But despite having political godfathers many ran into trouble and went bust leaving banks with enormous unpaid debts Success in infrastructure requires skill not just political friendsReaders may think I am a great Adani fan But I do not own any Adani company shares because of high prices and high risk Adani has been diversifying and expanding at breakneck speed using borrowed money bidding very high prices in auctions and acquisitions This facilitates fast expansion but carries great risks History has examples aplenty of business titans who diversified crazily to create giant conglomerates succeeded for a few decades amid applause but eventually came a cropper like General Electric under Jack WelchSo I think the Hindenburg report may be the best thing that ever happened to Adani It will slow his speed of expansion and diversification and force his financiers to be diligent and cautious in future This could impose highly desirable financial discipline on Adani to his own benefit Hindenburg may have been a blessing in disguise  or in Winston Churchills words in response to his wife trying to cheer him up after his postwar electoral defeat a blessing quite effectively disguisedOne day I might actually buy Adani shares,Swami Speaks Dhirubhai Ambani had beaten
