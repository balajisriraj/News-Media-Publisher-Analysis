The Indian Express,how shaktishaali brij bhushan sharan singh has ducked mud so far,in the wrestling arena or out of it fighting ascandidate of the bjp or the samajwadi party in the contest as candidate or with his wife as proxy brij bhushan sharan singh has rarely lostbout but that streak might end now with the growing allegations of sexual harassment against him by women wrestlers who are demanding singhresignation as the president of the wrestling federation of india wfiwrestler who tumbled into politics via the ram janmabhoomi movement and who continues to facecase in the babri masjid demolition singh 66 has kept his feet planted on the ground courtesy the image ofdabangg leader orshaktishaali powerful one as he likes calling himself who doesnneed the bjp as much as the bjp needs him in at least halfdozen districts around his native gonda in uttar pradesh singh is six term mp once from the sp who has represented gonda balrampur and now moved onto kaiserganj while his son prateek bhushan is into his second term as mla from gonda sadar this formidable record also explains why despite several scraps with the party including the government of up chief minister yogi adityanath there has been no attempt to touch his 10 year tenure as the wfi president and as vice president of the united world wrestling asia local leaders talk about the grand celebrations he holds every year on his birthday on january 8 where students shortlisted viatalent search examination are rewarded with motorcycles scooty and cash this year the event in gonda and adjoining districts such as lucknow ayodhya bahraich shrawasti balrampur and barabanki saw the participation of union minister of state for finance pankaj chaudhary bjp leaders also mention the goodwill brij bhushan singh has earned due to his active association with more than 50 educational institutions including engineering pharmacy education and law that that he helped set up in bahraich gonda balrampur ayodhya and shrawasti districts he has developed an empire in these districts through his clout he givesfee waiver to those students who are unable to pay so if he wins elections it is both because of his clout and goodwill saysbjp leader from gonda advertisement at the same time bjp leaders say the party has kept its distance by not giving him any position within the organisation and union government despite his repeated poll wins his own team of workers look after his constituency including day to day issues that might come up singh only takes the symbol of the party he wins elections on his own says another party leader the confidence means singh has got away with incidents such as his criticism of the adityanath government during the floods in the state in october last year he accused the administration of being ill prepared not doing enough for relief and said people had been left bhagwan bharose to the mercy of god singh also said that the existing government did not tolerate criticism and took it personally advertisement while the opposition raised the remarks to attack the adityanath government singh did not earn any rebuke from the bjp he has praised sp leader azam khan one of the bjpbiggest bugbears in the state asmass leader and threatened maharashtra navnirman sena mns chief raj thackeray against visiting ayodhya till he had apologised publicly for humiliating north indians in mumbai the bjp had been courting the mns leader as an ally at the time of topsy turvy politics in maharashtra in private the bjp had dismissed singhremarks as publicity stunts it was due to his association with the ram janmabhoomi movement and his influence in the areas around ayodhya that singh initially came to the notice of the bjp the party first fielded him from the gonda lok sabha seat in 1991 he won and never looked back in 1996 when he did not contest the party gaveticket to his wife ketaki devi singh and she too wonconstant presence at wrestling tournaments be it national or international senior or junior singh can be spotted withmicrophone in hand overseeing bouts often shouting out instructions to referees stopping and starting bouts and at times even throwing the rule book at judges when he canbe there he is known to monitor the proceedings virtually advertisement whatever comes of the serious allegations singh is now facing that is almost certain

loggerheads with wfi since the tokyo olympic games also claimed that several coaches at the national camp in lucknow have also exploited women wrestlers adding that there arefew women at the camp who approach wresters at the behest of the wfi president advertisement the 28 year old though clarified that she herself never faced such exploitation but claimed that one victim was present at the dharna they began at jantar mantar on wednesday vinesh also claimed that she had received death threats at the behest of wfi president from officials close to him because she dared to draw prime minister narendra modiattention to several issues plaguing indian wrestling when she met him after the tokyo gamesknow at least 10 20 women wrestlers who have told me about the sexual exploitation they faced at the hands of the wfi president they told me their storiescantake their names now butcan definitely reveal the names if we get to meet the prime minister and the home minister of the country vinesh said addressing the media after stagingfour hour dharna at jantar mantarhave received death threats from people who are close to the wfi president if anything happens to any of us sitting here only the wfi president will be responsible rio olympics medallist sakshi malik world championship medallist sarita mor sangeeta phogat anshu malik sonam malik satyawart malik jitender kinha amit dhankar and cwg medallist sumit malik were among 30 wrestlers who assembled at the famous protest site brij bhushan sharan singh 66 was elected president of wfi forthird consecutive term in february 2019 sitting beside vinesh tokyo olympics bronze medallist bajrang punia said the federation is being run in an arbitrary manner and they will not compete in any international competition unless the wfi president who is no less thandictator is removed our fight is not against the government or the sports authority of india sai this is against wfi yeh ab aar paar ki ladai hai ita fight to the finish we will continue this protest until wfi president is removed bajrang told pti we will not compete in any international competition until the wfi president is removed this isfight to save indian wrestling while we are denied help and support of foreign coaches the president has hiredforeign coach for his own academy in gonda punia later said while addressing the media he uses abusive language against wrestlers we can even show you videos of that in december 2021 the wfi president had slapped an overage wrestler during the under 15 national championship when he insisted on competing after being disqualified the sitting bjp mp from kaiserganj in uttar pradesh rejected all the charges against him and refused to quit his post there is no truth in any of the allegations why shouldquit even if one woman wrestler comes and proves the sexual harassment chargeam ready to be hanged there is an industrialist behind it conspiracy said the 66 year old wfi president there can be an investigation by the cbi or police there is no dictatorship these same wrestlers had met meweek back and did not say anything he added responding to the allegation of death threats given to vinesh on his behalf brij bhushan said why vinesh did not talk to me or approached the police at that time why did she not meet the pm or the sports minister why is she saying this now the wfi boss indicated that the new policy and the rules they have introduced are perhaps causingbit of discomfort to the wrestlers and thatwhy the protest he said the wrestlers are being asked to compete in the national championships and appear in trials for fair selection and there is nothing wrong in it different states host nationals and all want the countrybest athletes to compete none of these wrestlers has competed in the nationals we have made it clear that only those athletes who compete and win at the national championship will be selected for the national camp the state of haryana has been the pride of the country but we want to take wrestling to other states also so we stopped the arrangements of states sending multiple teams at the nationals states like bihar jharkhand manipur nagaland and mizoram are weak and we need to promote the game there so we introduced national open championships apart from the regular nationals and there also haryana claimed 61 per cent of the medals vinesh said she is labelled an indisciplined athlete because she dares to speak her mindam being tortured every day asked why they did not raise the issued before vinesh said these are powerful influential people we could not muster courage now we were not left with any option ab paani sar se paar ho raha hai the limit has been reached we have to think about the next generation of players as well adding to it bajrang said we are approaching the end of our careers for how long will we play 2024 2026 or maybe 2028 but it isquestion of the entire wrestling fraternity it may be recalled that the wfi while taking disciplinary action against vinesh for not wearing the official singlet during the tokyo games had banned her but later lifted it after receivingwritten apology from the athlete vinesh said she did not wear that singlet because it was zero quality explaining his position the wfi president said that they were facing action from the international olympic committee for flouting the rules and he had to take action against vinesh out of compulsion because he did not wantban on india except for the headline this story has not been edited by the telegraph online staff and has been published

the protest last week vinesh detailed how she struggled to cut weight days before her opening bout at the olympics and how the wfi president and general secretary had access to the games village essentially as part of this limited support staff wfi vs private sports sponsors like ogq jsw another major issue in the eyes of the wfi in the vinesh physio case was that the physio was attached to the private body that backed her olympic gold quest ogq this had beenlong running issue the wfi had denied ogqphysios access to the national camp as well in the run up to the olympics post the olympics singh in an interview with the indian express slammed private bodies like jsw and ogq for trying to take over the sport and sidelining the wfi he felt these private bodies only signed on

Deccan Herald,govtaction does not inspire confidence,the governmentdecision on the demand for action bynumber of women wrestlers against the alleged persistent sexual misconduct by brij bhushan sharan singh president of the wrestling federation of india wfi falls short on important grounds the protest was led by well known athletes bajrang punia vinesh phogat sarita mor and sakshi malik and they sought the dismissal of brij bhushan singh from his position the government announced that he would step down from his position tillcommittee that was to be set up to investigate the charges submitted its report committees are usually signs of compromises or means to delay decisions on an issue the government dillydallied ondecision on the wrestlers demand for three days it was only when it realised that their protest was evoking massive public sympathy that it deigned to talk to them and announced that singh would temporarily move away andcommittee would be set up in the normal course when sexual harassment charges are made and the internal committee system is non existent or dysfunctionalpolice case must be registered and investigations made in this case the charge is that many women wrestlers were harassed and that they did not have the courage to go public because the accused ispowerful person singh isfive time mp andpowerful leader of the bjp he has been president of the wrestling federation for overdecade he is very influential in the party and in the sports field that could be the reason why he is being treated with kid gloves even when serious charges have been made against him it is easy to imagine what would have been the response if the same charges had been made againstless connected person or an opposition party leader the wrestlers who made the charges are unhappy that the members of the probe committee were finalised without consultation with them though they had been told that they would be consulted taking the complainants into confidence would have created greater trust in the working of the committee not only among the complainants but among the public also it should be remembered that the public is alsoparty because the charges are public and are againstperson in public life it is unfortunate that this was not done the charges and the way they were handled expose many faults in the system and the rot within there was no credible grievance redressal system in the wrestlers body which the aggrieved athletes could trust women even those who are well known find it difficult to have their grievances attended to and redressed

The Week,wfi controversy might pin brijbhushan sharan singh for good,dhobi pachhad and kalajang these were the two favourite moves of brijbhushan sharan singh as his interest in wrestling took shape under mahant baba gyan das of the sagariya patti in hanuman garhi ayodhya the first isquick move wherein the opponent is turned over flung and pinned to the ground the second entails hoisting up oneopponent on oneback and then flinging him on his backbig factor that contributes to singhpower is the network of 29 educational institutions he has founded in his home district in uttar pradesh these are the very moves that have served singh well in his political career he is now in his sixth term aslok sabha member the first was in 1991 by the time the lok sabha elections of 1996 came he was locked up in tihar jail on charges of sheltering the associates of gangster dawood ibrahim there was speculation that he had helped ibrahimrelatives escape to pakistan via nepal there was also buzz that he had sheltered gangs that had targeted ibrahimfamily singh stuck to the code of brotherhood of criminals said an old time bjp member he offered help to all manner of criminals no matter which end of the spectrum they were on none of the charges against singh was proved also being in jail on charges under the terrorist and disruptive activities prevention act did little to dim singhpolitical prospects the bjp offeredticket to his wife ketki devi the sympathy for singh who had by then cultivated the image ofstaunch hindutva leader he was one of the accused in the babri masjid demolition case and had ledmatra raksha rath yatra against the activities of pakistaninter services intelligence translated into his wife polling 28 490 more votes than he had balram das of the sagariya patti has known singh since 1986 he dismissed all charges against his former wrestling mate he has worked with passion since he wasstudent he said under him wrestling in india reached its pinnacle he is solely responsible for turning it intosport that can change wrestlers lives those who are making allegations against him have benefitted most under his chairmanship of the wrestling federation of india but not all was well within singhown household in gonda 117km from lucknow in june 2004 his eldest son shakti took his life with his fatherlicenced pistol the suicide note left behind accused singh of not beinggood father there was also the charge that herich man had held back money from his four children while only the family knows if the death led to any introspection on singhpart the politician himself chose to blame television serials you cannot always be friendly with your children serials are poisoning childrenminds he had said when his father jagdamba sharan singh was in hospital for 18 days the son had paid him just one half hour visit unexplained deaths seem to have surrounded singh in 2019constable posted at his official residence in delhi shot himself no suicide note was foundbig factor that contributes to singhpower is the network of 29 educational institutions schools and colleges he has founded in his home district these are the kind of institutions where successful exam performances are guaranteed and where flying squads that make surprise checks to curb cheating never visit yet no one in gonda openly accuses singh of anything this despite the fact that in his 2019 affidavit filed before the election commission singh himself provided details of charges against him these include dacoity attempt to murder and disappearance of evidence rakesh vermagonda based social activist said singh is among the most domineering leaders of purvanchalhave never heard of any kind of allegations against his character maybe someone being beaten up or scolded but these are internal mattersfind allegations of his behaviour towards women wrestlers incomprehensible but then politics isgame of ambition radhey shyam mishraformer teacher from kaiserganj singhconstituency said that he had watched singhjourney since 1979 when he became students union general secretary in thes saketg college ayodhya from where he earnedlaw degree he hasknack of strengthening himself in any and every way said mishra he is bothloyal friend anddreadful enemy in politics from the graduates of his educational institutes he is cultivating an army of young supporters is that right or wrong whatever it might be no one dares open his mouth but some are willing to speak mayank singhconstruction contractor who works in both balrampur singhformer constituency and gonda said he isdabbang muscleman who has his own ways of establishing his men in business and politicscannot divulge whathave seen but infer from the fact that he got his son prateek elected as mla from gonda when he misses no opportunity to say that he is inparty that does not promote nepotism he may have been released from tihar but that isblack stain that will forever mark him there are other stains that dot singhlife in 1993 pandit singhsamajwadi party leader was shot in 2004 ghanshyam shuklabjp leader died in an apparent accident which his wife alleged wasmurder singhhand was suspected in both in the first the mp mla court acquitted him in the second the cbi handed himclean chit while most of singhpolitical career has been with the bjp from 2008 to 2014 he was with the samajwadi party on whose ticket he won his fourth term in parliament he then came down on the party declaring akhilesh yadav the last king of the sultanate of mulayam singh yadav not too long ago he criticised the state government for its lack of flood preparedness saying that public representatives had been reduced to being mere observers it wasjibe at chief minister yogi adityanath as in politics so in his personal life singh gets full marks for enthusiasm he lists listening to bhojpuri music as one of his hobbies and has on occasion taken to the stage to perform given the opportunity he also reels off urdu shayari both are terribly off key the latest charges might however throw him totally off scale and then none of his favourite kushti manoeuvres might be able to save

morning in his village juan sonipat dropped his daughter and son at the local government run akhara rural gymnasium then took them to school on his bike he went about his work on his farm of 21 bighas about 7 acres and did the evening round of the akhara waiting while his children finished as was his daily practice in the evening he flicked on the television on the news familiar faces put him on alert women wrestlers were insit in protest and had levelled charges of sexual abuse against the wrestling federation of india wfi president brij bhushan sharan singhgot into the car with coach sanjeet chhikara from the akhara and without thinking about it too much headed to delhi he says they sat in for three days with the contingent at jantar mantar for mr kumar this was personal his daughter khushi arya 14 had just won silver in 2022 in the under 50 kg category15 grand prix in bahadurgarh haryana it has been five years of sweat and toil for khushi who initially had to face neighbours jibes at taking upmansport she still deals withsporting facility that has no changing rooms for women waiting to shower back home and despite the haryana governmentkhel nursery scheme started to encourage grassroots athletes the scholarship money has never been credited to her account mr kumar thinks back to the beginnings of taking his two children his son isyear younger than khushi to the running track that skirts the mud pit of the akhara khushi would beat her younger brother and even some of the wrestlers who were training at the khajan singh akhada on the 2 to 3 km track he says the family got her enrolled despite the fact that she was just one of two girls amongst 50 55 boys and men at the heart of khushiinitial success is her family and the conversations they have openly for the longest timebelieved that nothing like this could happen towrestler and that wfi would treat its people who are assets indignified way butam not worried as long as my father is there says khushi she is interrupted by her father who calls her naive he says he can accompany her to local camps but not those run by wfi parents are not permitted there if anything ever happens if they are not listening to world champions like olympian sakshi malik and two time medal winner at the world championships vinesh phogat why would they listen topowerless farmer like me says mr kumar rhetorically her mother sharda devi is more pragmatic saying that women face harassment everywhere whether in sports or in schools she also has more faith in the system resolving this with the oversight committee being appointed to investigate the charges she still wonders though sab jaan kar bhi bacche ko jaane dein ya itni mehnat ke baad bacche ke bhavishya par laat maar dein despite knowing everything should we let our child go or after all this hard work should we beat her future down women wrestling with tradition in what underscores haryanadominance in womenwrestling at the national level pankaj nain director sports and youth affairs department haryana says that since 2002 women wrestlers from haryana have won 26 medals including eight golds acrossdozen international events three olympics four asian games and five commonwealth games he claims about six states have expressed an interest in replicating the statesports policy andfew had sent their delegations to study it in haryana community wrestling competitions or dangals aretradition vikas gulia president baba prakash puri sewa samiti one of the committees in sonipatagrarian purkhas village that has been organising dangals for over two decades now says they started inviting female wrestlers about five years ago the committee holds two dangals inyear january 9 and november 18 with the support of patrons including local wrestlers who have landed government jobs under the sports quota businessmen and local politicians like councillor satish gulia who donated 51 000 for their last dangal just as traditional akharas run mostly by former wrestlers asgive back gesture make up for the inadequate sports infrastructure in the state dangals act as crucial software for budding wrestlers helping them financially in the absence of monetary support from the government in the initial years while also offering them an opportunity to compete and learn mr gulia said the prize money at dangals ranged fromfew thousand rupees tofew lakhs many professional wrestlers survived on these community wrestling competitions held all through the year except the monsoon during the peak season march to july one dangal is held every day in the state on an average sonipat rohtak and jhajjar remain the wrestling hubs of the state but the trend has caught on in the adjoining districts of hisar panipat and jind as well with the opening up of private academies and training centres however compared to their male counterparts women may receive less prize money sometimes as low as 50 of the menfee some organising committees object to women participating and some are deterred by the additional costs in terms of wrestling mats toilets and changing rooms the game changer it was after geeta phogat won indiafirst ever international gold medal at the delhi commonwealth games cwg in 2010 that the craze for womenwrestling in the state hit the roof soon womenwrestling was all the rage itno surprise that the participation of female wrestlers at our dangals has grown manifold over these years from around 25 30 five years ago to 100 odd this year says mr gulia who is alsocoach at the local baba prakash puri akhara olympic medallists bajrang punia and sushil kumar too have fought at the dangals in our village before they achieved stardom mr gulia proclaims proudly as he instructs girls and boys teaching them how to holdgrip and select partners while shouting for someone to warm up properly before entering the ring suman kundubronze medallist at cwg 2010 tells us why the event wasturning point for girls in haryana the stellar performance of the women wrestlers from the state the wide media coverage and above all the opportunity for local villagers to watch the women perform live at an international event broughtsea change in their perception towards women wrestling says ms kundu nowharyana police sub inspector posted at rohtak she recalls how fellow villagers who had always snubbed her before the games despite her achievements in wrestling gave herherowelcome on her return to the village after the cwg feat both my father and coach had to face everyoneire for years for letting me choose wrestling haunted by the taunts my father even stopped socialising but continued to support me to give mebetter future my maternal uncles too did not approve of his decision and our families were not on talking terms for two years but the commonwealth games in 2010 changed it all overnight not just for me but for all girls out there and the stadiums were flooded with aspiring women wrestlers after the 2014 commonwealth games and 2016 olympics says ms kundu nowmother of two for girls like khushi the struggle has been more short lived with neighbours quickly changing their punches for praise when she began winning at the local level she also has role models to look up to hers is vinesh phogat and her voice changes when she talks about the time ms phogat met her attraining camp and praised her moves khushi is focussed on making it to the international circuit but with the contradictions ofregular teen what makes her smile is the fact that shethe first girl student to be selected sports captain at her school south point international in ratangarh ambala district it matters to her that her friends admire her and that sheseen as someone who cannot be fooled with sheproud of the way her body has changed to be more muscular and likes to keep her hair short men are more powerful she says and enjoys the challenge of training with them through period pains and stains the boys treat her like one of them retired district sports officer ishwar dahiya credits chandgi ramfreestyle wrestler from hisarsisai village for laying the foundation of womenwrestling in haryana in the late 1990s by encouraging his daughters sonika and deepika kaliraman to take up the sport despite stiff social opposition mr dahiya remembers training his first ever girls batch in rohtak in 2002 initially it was fame and recognition that drew the girls to wrestling courts in haryana but the successive state governments especially bhupinder singh hoodacongress regime tweaked the sports policy to shower the players with heftier cash prize money and government jobs making itlucrative proposition and with haryana always dominating the national wrestling space the girls in the state grabbed the opportunity with both hands it pulled families both with wrestling and non wrestling backgrounds to the sport inbig way says the 66 year old the hooda government filled hundreds of vacancies for coaches set up residential training centres for different sports and amended the haryana police service rules to reserve 3 permanent deputy superintendent of police posts for direct appointment of outstanding sportspersons many players such as hockeymamta kharab wrestler geetika jakhar cricketer joginder sharma boxer vijender singh and incumbent minister and hockey player sandeep singh reaped the benefits of the policy khushimother refers topopular saying in haryanvi it says that while preparingwrestler all four corners ofhouse are shaken inreference to the economic social physical and emotional labour that the whole family goes through the women wrestlers of haryana are shaking more thanhouse they are in fact fighting injustice entitlement andwhole male mindset we

The Indian Express,pushkar singh dhami experts have not linked projects and joshimath incidents development is needed,when cracks appeared on roads and houses across joshimathkey point of discussion was the successive official reports that foretold the disaster in the hilly town as research goes on to assess the situation there uttarakhand chief minister pushkar singh dhami speaks to the indian express about what lies ahead the resettlement plan for the residents and the action plan to prevent similar damage in other parts of the state excerpts the state government is in touch with the central agencies working in joshimath what lies ahead based on the assessment so far there are eight technical institutes here10 member team from the central building research institute cbri another 10 member team from the national geophysical research institute ngriseven member team from the wadia institute seven geological survey of india gsi scientists four central ground water board cgwb scientists and the national disaster management authority ndma officials while temporary relief options are already on rs 3 77 crore has been distributed to 307 affected families as interim relief plans for temporary resettlement will be made according to the findings of these agencies our aim is to provide all possible facilities to people and resettle them in the best way as far as the future of joshimath is considered around 70 per cent of the area is unaffected the shops are open people are going about their day to day life and are regularly visiting the auli town close to joshimath the yatra chardham yatra begins only after four months last year the number of visiting tourists setrecord we are prepared this year too there is no need for unnecessary doubts the chamoli district administration is talking to the affected families is therefinal decision on permanent rehabilitationcommittee headed by the district magistrate has been formed and they are conducting an assessment survey all options are open for permanent rehabilitation currently people are living in hotels and temporary shelters the next step will be to shift them to prefabricated structures built on areas certified by geological experts the third step would be permanent rehabilitation inchosen and verified area multiple options are being looked at one is to give people money and the liberty to go and settle wherever they want another is providing land to help people build their houses both these options would be available and people would have the liberty to choose what they want an amount of rs 1 50 lakh is already being provided to the disaster affected landowners until the permanent rehabilitation policy is determined this includes an advance amount of rs 1 lakh which will be adjusted and an additional rs 50 000 for the transportation of goods and other immediate needs you recently met home minister amit shah what requests were made to the centre is therespecific amount you asked for rehabilitation work the prime minister himself is taking cognizance of the situation and is continuously monitoring it he assured all possible help to joshimath and uttarakhand we requested amit shahji to provide central help for the disaster relief work and he also assured all possible help we have not given an estimated number to the central government advertisement however we informed them that based on the primary discussion with central technical institutions there is need for widespread reconstruction in the area and thatfinal estimation would be given after the technical surveys are over in joshimath the state cabinet proposed spending of funds on various short term and medium term works from its resources till funds are received asrelief package from the centre we assure that there will be no shortage of funds for the works undertaken reports suggest that eight other districts in the state apart from chamoli are facingsimilar situation is the state government aware of this and is therelong term plan we arestate that has always faced such disasters this is the himalayan region and it has always been geologically very active that changeslot of things this is why we want to assess the carrying capacity of the land and make plans accordingly advertisement we have already instructed the urban development department to prepare effective urban town planning in each district instructions have also been given for effective arrangement of drainage and sewer systems in hill townshave also directed officials to makephase wise plan where such systems are not in place there are allegations that we started too late in joshimath and that places like karnaprayag where similar cracks have appeared in houses are not getting the required attention we are fully aware of the situation in places like karnaprayag and dharchula and we are working there too relief work is also on this is why we are focusing on proper drainage and sewer systems in all the affected areas across the state we are making phase wise plans afterdetailed study of the load bearing capacity of all such areas we will makestate wide plan our priority is to balance ecology economy and development moving forward most of these affected places are near the ongoing chardham railway project is there any plan to stop the project or at least reconsider it the expert reports and the findings of the central agencies have not suggested any connection between the projects and the disasters mentioned allwould say is that it is notgood idea to jump to conclusions and it is too soon to assume what is causing the cracks we need to have some scientific basis for making suchclaim people might be making claims for different reasons what we need to understand is that infrastructure development is important for the state and the country development is needed and we cannot stop it just like that for now our focus is on the rehabilitation of those affected we need to take care of the women children and elders we need better drainage and sewage systems and water outlets this is our focus there islot of discussion on the 1976c mishra report both the bjp and congress are blaming each other for failing to implement its recommendations some people will always try to politicise such issues this is not the time for blame game we should all avoid politicising this and come together to workpersonally do not want to blame anyone my job is to provide relief to the people and make long term plans to tackle the situation that is precisely whatam doing advertisement the gag order issued by the ndma after isro published images ofsinking joshimath drewlot of criticismminister in the state cabinet suggested that the state government was involved in this decision we should always wait for official study reports on such sensitive issues saying anything without an official report is hasty therefore such things should be avoided until we have received study reports from all institutions and have compiled all the reports there are all kinds of possibilities uniform civil code was one of your biggest electoral promises can we expect it to be implemented an expert committee is working onucc draft we are the first in the country to have this we expect to have the draft ready by this year and to start working on making itlaw as of now the expert panel is compiling and studying the suggestions received by various stakeholders advertisement the state has takensimilar stand on religious conversion and made the law stricter yes religious conversion wasserious issue in the state some people were using all kinds of tools to lure locals in rural and tribal areas this is the devbhoomi land of gods and suchdisgusting practice should not be allowed here nothing should be allowed here that goes against religion this is why we made the anti conversion law stricter and made unlawful conversionscognizable and non bailable offence punishable withprison term of up to 10 yearsinvite other states also to make similar laws and ensure no one is lured into religious conversion advertisement crimes against scs sts are increasing in the state there was an incident recently in uttarkashi we are making sure such incidents are not repeated in the state we want everyonecooperation,"['when', 'cracks', 'appeared', 'on', 'roads', 'and', 'houses',

jantar mantar in central delhi infew hours she and several other top indian wrestlers would be part of the biggest protest by indian athletes against sports administrators in recent memory but as they placed mattresses around the pavement atsite that has been demarcated asvenue for protests in new delhi the 28 year old says she waslittle underwhelmed itnot like we had any knowledge of what to expect we didneven know exactly what you were supposed to do atprotesthad heard about jantar mantar on tvknew thatwhere people go to protest in delhi butdidneven know exactly where it was the two time world medallist tells sportstar indian wrestlers huddle together as they deliberate during against wrestling federation of india president brijbhushan sharan singh and other officials in new delhi india thursday jan 19 2023 photo credit apactually had this image in my head that we were going to be on some sort of stage and giving bhashan speeches likepolitician then on the first daysaw that we were going to be protesting on the pavementrealised we wereneven carrying microphones luckily we had got some mattresses she says on that first day of what would bethree day long sit in vinesh sat next to olympic medallist bajrang punia and sakshi malik world medallists sarita mor and anshu malik junior world champion sonam malik and asian medallist jitender kumar at this stage there was still little to mark out the wrestlers protest from the dozens that routinely go on at jantar mantar the wrestlers shared space on that first day with striking aanganwadi workers from kerala andgroup of nurses who had been laid off from their jobs in new delhi hospitals prior to arriving at jantar mantar though vinesh alongside sakshi and bajrang had sent out identical social media posts that read athletes win medals for the nation with their hard work but the federation doesndo anything but try to bring them down players are being harassed by imposing arbitrary laws the posts also had the hashtag as word spread of some of indiamost accomplished athletes on the road in new delhi media began to trickle in the wrestlers were tight lipped only saying they were protesting against what they termed the dictatorial nature of the wrestling federation and the wfi president brij bhushan sharan singh who had been in that position since 2011 they only said they would speak at 4m that day with the promise that what they said would createdhamaka explosion it was as they said at 4m the wrestlers accused federation officials and coaches of financial impropriety unsympathetic planning and mental harassment theythen drop the biggest bombshell of all accusing the federation president and national camp coaches of sexual exploitation yaun shoshan of female athletes going backdecade the accusations particularly of exploitation against brij bhushan sharan singhpowerful member of parliament from the ruling bjp who had won the wfi elections uncontested three times were particularly seismic they took the protest beyond purelysporting one it is however learned that it wasnthe alleged harassment that had been the sole breaking point for the athletes according to vinesh anger had been building up forlong time there wasnthat something happened to me or anyone and we decided to protest but things had been getting intolerable she says in vineshcase the immediate trigger had been the federationinitial refusal to include her at the national camp and the first international competition of the season the croatia ranking series in the first week of february ostensibly vinesh had been excluded since she didnparticipate in the national championships something that the federation had mandated for all athletes last year vineshreasoning though was also not without merit she had been injured at the world championships where she had wonbronze justfew months earlier vinesh had requested for an exemption justfew days before the start of the protest vinesh had to plead her case for inclusion beforegovernment panel this was ultimately granted related mc mary kom to lead oversight committee to probe allegations against wfi president this wasnthe first time vinesh and other senior athletes had been made to run through hoops each of us had our own problem each of us had been dealing with something everyone was being troubled in some way says vinesh apart from not being called up for camps there was disagreement over coaching the federation had banned surjeet mann bajrangcoach for the previous year from the camp owing to disciplinary charges after he had stepped onto the mat at the 2022 nationals followingdisagreement withrefereedecision after the tokyo olympics the wfi ended the contracts of all foreign coaches working privately with wrestlers this affected bajrang coached by shako bentinidis vinesh coached by woller akos and ravi dahiya coached by kamal malikov akos exit was particularly bitter with the highly rated hungarian coach accused by the wfi president of misusing funds it was so humiliating with what face could we go and ask someone to work with us again vinesh says at fault wrestling federation of india wfi chief brij bhushan sharan singh addressing the media following the protests photo credit pti then there was the question of what was seen as meddling by the federation in commercial partnerships the wrestlers had at the start of last year wrestlers in india were sponsored by multiple entities over the last year the wfi had got intopartnership with one of them and had been pressing wrestlers signed by other contractors to sign with the first the wfi also made it clear that all sponsorships were to be channelled through them alone the decision to protest was made atmeeting in sonepat justday before the wrestlers actually gathered in jantar mantar onlyfew senior wrestlers who were present on the opening day knew about it the more people knew about this the more chances of it being leaked and we also knew we had to be there together in the past we had heard that one or two had come forward but they got cowed down vinesh says once they showed up at jantar mantar though the protesters wondered whether they were up for what they were going to talk about it wasnembarrassing to be sitting on the ground we have come from the ground only mitti slowly as the media gathered we started gettinglittle nervous on whether we were up for this everyone was scared everyone knows what he wfi president is capable of doing we came in knowing that we would be as good as dead if this protest didnwork out vinesh says that was because of all the complaints they planned to bring up it was the issue of sexual harassment that was the most emotive it was also one that many female wrestlers were particularly wary of addressing you have to understand the background of these girls they are mostly from rural families where such issues mean beizzati loss of honour itnot so easy to come up and say all this happened to me because then you will have to face people who will say this is what will happen when you wanted to play sports says an individual associated with the protesters and didnwant to be named back in 2012 an official complaint of harassment had been made againstmale coach by girls at the junior national camp in lucknow this particular coach was initially suspended and the matter was investigated bysai sports authority of india committee however no final report was made after one of the complainants withdrew her accusation and claimed her signature on the complaint was forged according to those at the protest this was one of the reasons why the accusations were only made some way into the first daypress conference after issues of financial impropriety and lack of coaching support were raised it was finally vinesh who broached the topic everyone was wondering who would be the first to speak up she says itnot like no one knew what was going on in the camps it was to protect girls that parents would come with them to the camp but the problem was the trouble was happening outside india as well paap ka ghada bhar chuka tha vessel of sin had become full already everyone was aware of it but no one had the courage to say somethingam happy thathad the courage to step forward and tell the truth vinesh says according tosource close to another athlete who wasnpresent at the protest and asked not to be named some of the harassment was done with the promise of favours international tours and sponsorshipsamstrong willed girl sowas never going to be swayed but there are so many girls who donhave that ability to say no says vinesh the wrestlers also found support from athletes from other disciplines like boxer vijender singh who is also congress party member who joined the wrestlers at jantar mantar photo credit pti even vinesh wasnsure about speaking out until she thought ofyoung relative who wants to take up wrestling my career is anyway established butwas thinking about the juniorshaveyoung relative who is just starting to wrestlewas thinking about hermight have come through what had happened but if nothing changed the system would just eat her alive vinesh says the protests gathered steam following the allegations as the protests continued more wrestlers joined from the akhadas in the capital as well as towns around delhi the wrestlers got more comfortable with sitting in public at first we were nervous about what to expect but that went away some people were wondering if we were embarrassed to sit on the ground in front of everyone but we have all started our pehelwani in mitti the driven earth in which traditional kushti is played so we were returning to that says vinesh with police permission given for the protest between 12m and 6m each day the wrestlers spent as much time as they could at the protest site women wrestlers usedsulabh toilet complex some 50 metres away from the site where they would change their clothes and freshen up other non worldly support camelittle further away there isfamous hanuman temple in janpath we go and pray in the morning but before that we manage to takebath at the premises said asian medallist jitender kumar related babita phogat joins oversight committee panel formed against wfi while simply taking the first step to protest had beenmajor step for many it was not enough to get what they wanted the resignation of the wfi president with brij bhushan sharan singh denying the charges and refusing to step aside the matter was at loggerheads on the second day the players said they would seek the registry of an fir regarding their accusation of harassment if their demands were not met over the next few hours but that deadline came and went meanwhile there waspush back from the other side several female wrestlers made videos some obviously coached where they spoke in favour of sharan singh others pointed out that the most serious accusation of harassment was brought up far later than other charges others pointed out that one of the protesters sakshi malik wasmember of the wfiown sexual harassment committee others wondered what was the role of babita phogatmember of the ruling bjp who is also bajrangsister in law and vineshcousin babita had showed up on the second day and said she was speaking to the government on the players behalf brij bhushan sharan singh denied the charges and refused to step aside photo credit ani people are going through what we spoke dissecting everything we spoke but we never prepared how we were going to speak none of us have trained for this we are wrestlers we barely know how to speak and put our point forward we hadnplanned anything we hadnspoken to any lawyers we just assumed that people will believe us why would we risk our careers if we didnbelieve what we were saying was the truth says vinesh in the meantime the ministry of sports got involved on the first day of the protest the ministry issuedletter to the wfi requiring them to answer the charges put forward by the protesting athletes within three days the players met representatives of the ministry of sports on the second day without resolution and then went to the home of the sports minister anurag thakur later that night it is learned that several women athletes repeated their claims of harassment at that meeting however that meeting too ended withoutsolution it was only on the night of the third day that the deadlock was broken the sports minister addressedmeeting with five others bajrang vinesh sakshi ravi and babita the minister stated that brij bhushan would step aside formonth whilefive member oversight committee would investigate the charges in turn bajrang said the protest would be called offday later the wfi assistant secretary vinod tomar was also removed from his post while that and the suspension of the activities of the federation seems to bestep forward it also raises several other questions says supreme court lawyer rahul mehra thereno doubt the government has the right to suspend the working of the federation if there is violation of the national sports code you have to specify what is the specific violation and then you can proceed with the suspension ideally it is throughshow cause notice once the reply is not satisfactory you can derecognise the body he says mehra raises the specific example of the wfiown sexual harassment committee what is most problematic is the fact that the wfiinternal complaints committee on sexual abuse violates the vishakha guidelines this is in direct violation of the national sports code 2011 which obliges federations to implement it in suchsituation the intervention of the sports authority of india sai and ioa is necessary says mehra according to the vishakha guidelines for cases of sexual harassment of women at workplace the chairperson of this committee has to bewoman and more than half of the members of the committee will also be women none of this though was followed in the wficommittee notes mehra but there is another issue says mehra while there wasclear violation of the code the ministry has been looking the other side in this case it was the mp from the ruling party so there was no question of derecognising or suspending this body the problem with the violations of all these issues is not so much in the federation who are anyway at fault but with the government of india and ministry of sport which has chosen to look the other way says mehra as it stands the wfi has still not been derecognised or suspended neither has the wfi president stepped down he has merely stepped away from handling the day to day functions of the federation while the five member committee has said they would speak to the alleged victims of harassment there have been questions raised on the neutrality of the committee which is headed by olympic medallist mary kom who was elected to the rajya sabha by the the ruling party another member olympic medallist yogeshwar dutt has also contested state elections onbjp ticket and had also raised the possibility of the allegations being fake when the matter is of suchmagnitude you want the committee to be as neutral as possible and one in which the athletes will have complete confidence in testifying to this doesnseem like that says mehra indeed it is learned that at least one wrestler who says she was harassed and was initially adamant she would tell her story has now takenstep back the prospect of public scrutiny andpotentially long media trial she says has caused her to change her mind union minister of sports and youth affairs anurag thakur along with wrestlers bajrang punia vinesh phogat sakshee malikkh babita phogat and ravi kumar dahiya addressesjoint press conference regarding the wrestlers protest against the wrestling federation of india wfi and its chief brij bhushan sharan singh the protest was called off after this meeting photo credit ani the protesting wrestlers too said that they were not taken into confidence by the government when the committee was being formed and asked the government to include two members of their choice one of whom it is learned was babita phogat on january 31week andhalf after first announcing the formation of the oversight committee the sports ministry did finally include babita phogat while she had once hoped forquick resolution vinesh doesnregret going down this path itnot as ifm sleeping well in factve been barely able to sleep since the first day but the arrow has already left the bow and now therenothing else to do but see whether it hits the target she says the wrestlers themselves have made their peace with the knowledge that the battle will belong one vinesh who had initially been upset over not being included in the team for the croatia ranking series has pulled out of the competition bajrang ravi dahiya and sakshi have done the same as well initially we had protested because it wasquestion of our wrestling careers but now we know that the matter is much bigger than that our wrestling career is not the first priority right now says vinesh vinesh says alongside the messages of support there have been those including some close to her who question the wisdom in going up againstpowerful politician even now we have family members telling us maybe we shouldnhave done this there is so much at stake here but there was no option but to go ahead at the end of this only one of us us or brij bhushan is going to be standing but regardless of what happens at least there will besense of fear in people so that all that had happened doesnhappen again nervousness has given way to wry humour vinesh compares the situation to that ofwrestling competition he wfi president thought athletes would never speak up normally what are we in comparison tobig neta politician agaryeh competition hota he must have seen us and thought he was in an easy bracket he thought he hadbye he didnrealise he was up

brij bhushan sharan singh the protesters raised several issues from sexual exploitation of women athletes mental harassment death threats as well as the poor planning of competition and training the

ESPN,wrestlers protest halfway to probe committee deadline questions linger and sport in limbo,itbeenlittle over two weeks since the wrestlers protests came to an end with the sports ministry formingfive member oversight committee to investigate the charges made against the wrestling federation of india and its president brij bhushan sharan singh the committee was givenfour week deadline to complete its investigation into the allegations of sexual exploitation intimidation harassment and financial irregularities of the federation and its president however halfway through there are no signs of the committee having made any progress meanwhile the wrestlers whose protests led to the investigation have been vocal in their criticism of the committeecomposition on their social media wrestlers vs wfi how the protest built up over months there have been signs of further tension between the athletes and the administration and there is also some concern over the staging of the asian wrestling championships scheduled to take place in new delhi from march 28top wrestler who was part of the protest says that the committee has not shared any updates with them the wrestlers have also not been told whether the asian championships will go ahead committee composition on january 23 sports minister anurag thakur announced the scope of the five member oversight committee the committee is headed by mary kom and includes former wrestler yogeshwar dutt ex badminton player and mission olympic cell member trupti murgunde ex tops ceo rajesh rajagopalan and former sai executive director teams radhica sreeman it should be noted that the committee had no representative from the legal fraternity orneutral person from outside the system all five members were from within the sporting system given the nature of charges it would be expected to function almost asposh committee and so should have had some legal and outside representation additionally mary kom is an mp nominated by the bjp and so is essentially brij bhushancolleague while dutt is very closely aligned with the party and had sided with the administration during the protests in response bajrang vinesh and sakshi malik tweeted that despite being given assurances the government did not consult them before forming the committee this resulted inchange and former wrestler babita phogat was included in the committee it is believed that the protesting wrestlers wanted her on the committee but the criteria for her addition are unclear meanwhilesimilar committee appointed by the indian olympic association seems to have disbanded ceding the probe to the sports ministry in their first action since taking over the committee named the indian contingent 11 greco roman 13 male freestyle and 12 women wrestlers for the zagreb open grand prix top wrestlers including ravi dahiya bajrang punia and vinesh phogat pulled out of the event by stating they were not competition ready as things stand there are stillnumber of administrative and investigative questions left india are hosts of the asian championship which will decide the seeding for the world championship later this year which will serve asparis olympics qualifier the committee has to not only decide the logistics for it but also how the indian squad will be chosen this usually requires trials in advance which means the wrestlers have to start

internationally dangal merely gave them the spotlight they had long been denied in recent years they have been feted not just as athletes but also as stars but if their recent allegations of sexual misconduct against people in power at the wrestling federation of india wfi are any indication their celebrity has not saved them from exploitation on the bitterly cold morning of january 18 several

come out in support of singh meanwhile singh who stepped down temporarily as president of the wfi denied all charges and declared himself ready to be hanged if even one female wrestler could establish

condition of anonymity said that many girls who come from rural and impoverished backgrounds are coerced by senior officials into giving sexual favours on the basis of false promises for these young female athletes the stakes are highfact which probably ensures their silence norris pritamsenior sports journalist who has covered six olympic games told frontline that while sexual harassment was quite prevalent in the world of sports onlyfew cases got publicised onlyminuscule section of such incidents gets reported because of fear of superiors family pressure and societal issueshave met many women who have left promising careers because of sexual harassment he said indian sports federations are still male dominated said pritam even when the federations receive such complaints they mishandle them and nothing much comes out of the investigations and committees that are formed however pritam believes that the recent protest will at least encourage men and women to speak out it will also send outmessage to officials and coaches who should be alarmed he said it has takenlot of courage for us to come together and protest the wrestlers wrote inletter to the head of indian olympic associationt ushap mohan former sports editor of the hindu pointed out that over the decades sports activities have changed from beinghobby or passion to becomefull fledged industry involving

vinesh was outspoken in her allegations at the press conference the protesters addressed this exploitation is happening every day why does the training camp happen in lucknow the reason ithappening

Times of India,apple apple maps privacy bug why iphone users donneed to worry,how iphone users were not at risk what apple had to sayrecently reported apple maps bug was reportedly allowing apps to collect user location data without permission several apps could have exploited this privacy bug to their advantage according toreport by 9to5macbrazilian food delivery app named ifood accesseduserlocation data in ios 16 2 even after the user denied all location access to the app the cupertino based tech giant started rolling out to the general public last month among other new features the latest ios version also includedlist of security updates the apple maps privacy bug that allowed an app to bypass privacy preferences was also addressed by one of these fixes the report also claims that the company has clarified that iphone users were never at risk due to this security flaw the company also denied the report regarding the brazillian food delivery app accessing user locations without permission in ios 16 2 as per the report apple has explained that the maps vulnerability that was patched could only be exploited from unsandboxed apps on macos moreover the company added the fix to all of applesoftware updates including ios and ipados tvos and watchos this was done by the company as the codebase is shared by all these operating systems apple has also claimed that the suggestion that this vulnerability could have allowed apps to circumvent user controls on iphone is false the company also concluded that the app was not circumventing user controls through any mechanism the apple maps security flaw was first discovered by an anonymous researcher instatement to 9to5mac apple said at apple we firmly believe users should choose when to share their data and with whom last week we issued an advisory forprivacy vulnerability that could only be exploited from unsandboxed apps on macos the codebase that we fixed is shared by ios and ipados tvos and watchos so the fix and advisory was propagated to those operating systems as well despite the fact that they were never at risk the suggestion that this vulnerability could have allowed apps to circumvent user controls on iphone is falsereport also incorrectly suggested an ios app was exploiting this or another vulnerability to bypass user control over location data our follow up investigation concluded that the app was not circumventing user controls through any mechanism,"['how', 'iphone', 'users', 'were', 'not', 'at', 'risk', 'what', 'apple', 'had', 'to', 'sayrecently', 'reported',

Times of India,interpretation of law must keep pace with the changing needs of society supreme court,new delhi holding that the courtinterpretation of the constitution must be in tune with the changing times and some of its earlier interpretations are no longer valid the supreme court has said that excommunication or ostracisation ofperson in society is against constitutional ethos as it will result in his civil death and decided to re examine its six decade old verdict permittingreligious community to excommunicate its dissidentsfive judge bench of justices sanjay kishan kaul sanjiv khanna abhayoka vikram nath andk maheshwari said the apex court1962 judgment protecting the rights of the bohra community to excommunicate its members required reconsideration it said much water has flown after that decision and the court at that time did not examine that article 26which talks about the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion is also subject to morality for example the narrow interpretation given to article 21 in thek gopalan era is no longer valid the concept of freedom has undergone changes in the 21st century society looks completely different from what it looked in the last century we seechange in the socio cultural ethos of society thus the interpretation of law must keep pace with changing needs of society justice oka said the court did not agree with the earlier constitution bench verdict and said the issue needed to be decided bylarger bench it held that excommunication or ostracisation is anathema to the concepts of liberty and equality and against anti discriminatory ethos which formspart of constitutional morality even assuming that the excommunication of members of the dawoodi bohra community is always made on religious grounds the effect and consequences thereof on the person excommunicated needs to be considered in the context of justiciable constitutional rights it saidperson who is excommunicated by the community will not be

Times of India,putinwarstrategic failure for kremlin says us treasury secretary janet yellen,bengaluru us treasury secretary janetyellen on thursday said russiaeconomy has become increasingly isolated and the impact of sanctions against that country for war against ukraine is being seen since the early days of the war we have partnered withmultilateral coalition of over 30 countries to impose severe economic costs on russia for its brutal assault our twin goals are to degrade russiamilitary industrial complex and reduce the revenues that it can use to fund its war we are seeing the impacts of these actions yellen said speaking to reporters here she said the russian military is struggling to replace over 9 000 pieces of heavy military equipment that it has lost since february 2022 it has suffered production shut downs at key defence industrial facilities further russiaeconomy has become increasingly isolated estimates indicate that nearlymillion russians may have left the country last year this is putting downward pressure on its productive capacity going forward she added yellen was speaking to reporters ahead of the first g20 finance ministers and central bank governors fmcbg meeting under the g20 indian presidency scheduled on february 24 and 25 here as us joe president biden has said we will stand with ukraine in its fight for as long as it takes the treasury secretary

beenstrategic failure for the kremlin ukraine still stands and nato and our global coalition stand united behind it responding toquestion on concerns about chinadeepening ties with russia and her message to china yellen said with respect to sanctions and aid to russia we have made clear that providing material support to russia or assistance with any type of systemic sanctions evasion would bevery serious concern to us we would certainly continue to make it clear to the chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdiction about what the rules are regarding our sanctions

Times of India,iisc iisc study shows chemically modified nanosheets can aid drug delivery,bengaluru inrecent study researchers from the indian institute of scienceiisc department of organic chemistry oc and materials research centre mrc show that surface modifications of two dimensional molybdenum disulphide an inorganic compound composed of molybdenum and sulphur or 2d mos2 nanosheets can make them highly effective for applications like delivering drugs to diseased cells researchers modified the surface of 2d mos2 nanosheets with thiol sulphur containing ligands and found that these thiols can be exchanged with naturally occurring thiols in biological systems which could allow drugs attached to these nanosheets to be released these chemically modified nanosheets were also found to be safe to use inside living cells our study shows that thiol exchange on 2d mos2 nanosheets is effective and the nanomaterial is stable in the presence of various biomolecules this is an important observation as it will make this nanomaterial highly beneficial for biomedical applications like drug delivery said mrinmoy de associate professor department of oc and senior author of the study published in acs nano the team first usedfluorescent thiol called boron dipyrromethene bod sh to modify the surface of the 2d mos2 nanosheets in order to createfunctionalised version bod mos2 then they tested the possibility of thiol to thiol exchange on bod mos2 using glutathione gshnaturally occurring thiol found in abundance in cancer cells they found that gsh molecules swapped places with bod sh on the surface of the nanosheetprocess that they confirmed using fluorescence techniques when researchers attached an anti cancer drug named doxorubicin dox to the nanosheet surface they found that thiol exchange could also happen between gsh and dox allowing dox to get dropped off at the diseased site because the exchange happens only in the presence of high concentrations of gsh found in diseased cells drugs like dox can be delivered specifically to cancer cells without affecting normal cells which can also potentially reduce any side effects iisc said nanomaterials usually need to be modified or customised depending on the application to improve their efficiency typically they are chemically modified throughprocess called functionalisation which involves attaching ligands small or large molecules to the surface of the nanomaterial previous efforts have focused on using gold nanoparticles for such biomedical applications according to the researchers but these nanoparticles are expensive and have limited efficiency due to their non selectivity between mono thiols and disulphides iisc said pradipta beherapostdoctoral research scholar at iisc and the first author of the study said their experiments show that 2d mos2 nanosheets can be an effective substitute for gold nanoparticles and they will be greatly beneficial in the field of nanomedicine the mos2 nanosheets were found to be stable in the presence of biofluids they also havehigher surface area than gold nanoparticles which means that they can be more efficient moving forward iisc said the team plans to work on improving the stability of the nanomaterial in the presence of various thiol containing liquids and exploring alternative surface modification approaches to customise the nanosheets for other applications this work on 2d mos2 nanosheets can be developed in the future as an alternative to rna and dna delivery applications which can be useful for detecting and treating infections such as covid 19 behera added,"['bengaluru', 'inrecent', 'study', 'researchers', 'from', 'the', 'indian', 'institute', 'of', 'scienceiisc', 'department', 'of', 'organic', 'chemistry', 'oc', 'and',

Times of India,19 wild cows killed in us aerial shooting operation,albuquerquespecialized team of wildlife managers has killed 19 wild cows in the gila wilderness in southwestern new mexico as part ofcontested project to rid the area of the unauthorized animals the three day operation usedhelicopter and high powered rifles to take out the cows inrugged area where federal officials and environmentalists say the animals have been trampling stream banks damaging habitat for other species and ruining water quality the us forest service had estimated there were as many as 150 of the unauthorized cows in an area along the gila river the agency said tuesday that searches were conducted with the naked eye and through thermal imagery the crew spotted significant numbers of elk deer javelina and even rabbits but no additional cattle were found following the operation the carcasses will be left in the forest to decompose and the forest service plans to monitor the area ranchers had opposed the project saying rounding up the animals and removing them would have beenmore humane way to clear them out of the wilderness they accused the forest service of violating its own policies butfederal judge denied their request to sideline the project saying the cows were indeed feral and the forest service had the authority to kill them gila forest supervisor camille howes saidcombination of ground based and aerial removal efforts since october 2021 have substantially reduced the feral cattle population we are committed to removing these feral cattle as safely efficiently and humanely as possible to ensuregila wilderness that is safe and resilient for generations to come she said instatement she also said the forest service is committed to working with the ranching community and will coordinate with permittees to remove any branded cattle from areas where they re not supposed to be ranchers have said fewer people are maintaining fences and the rural neighbors who used to help corral wayward cows are gone some have left the business because of worsening drought making water scarce for cattle and skyrocketing costs for feed and other supplies increased use of public lands including hunting and hiking also has resulted in knocked down fences the ranchers said elk too are to blame for damaging fences meant to keep cows in check new mexico gov michelle lujan grisham even weighed in on the fight over the gilawild cows saying last week that the federal government needed to dobetter job of listening to residents the forest service on tuesday reiterated its position that killing the cows was the most efficient and humane way to deal with this issue,"['albuquerquespecialized', 'team', 'of', 'wildlife', 'managers', 'has', 'killed',

The Indian Express,behind amritpal rise deepening political vacuum widening governance gaps growing discontent,the developments over the last few days seemed to be emblematic of what ails punjabmob led bywould be ideologue stormedpolice station in the border district of amritsar bringing back memories of the dark days of militancy and this happened onday when governor banwari lal purohit and chief minister bhagwant singh mann locked horns over convening of the assemblybudget session the aam aadmi party aap led state government finally approached the supreme court which rapped both the governor and the cm while expressing its disappointment over their actions for precipitating the row for long punjab has been trying to erase the memories of militancy while seeking to lower the heat over issues such as the division of river waters and the capital between punjab and haryana besides the demand for more autonomy now it is faced withdouble whammy as amritpal singh30 year old born again evangelist is not only raking up the khalistan issue but also harping on the stateinability to root out the menace of drugs ravaging its youth and to punish the guilty in the 2015 sacrilege cases the audacious takeover of the ajnala police station bylarge mob led by amritpal who returned from dubai six months ago is causing much consternation in the state it is also giving credence to voices that have been warning that the aap government is too inexperienced to governsensitive state like punjab while cm mann has held that not too much should be read into the ajnala incident the point remains that there seems to be discontent on the ground and that amritpal is feeding on it officials who support the let it take its course policy should know that punjab needs an administration that is both strong and sensitive while amritpalact of taking the guru granth sahib with him during the storming of the ajnala police station has angeredsizeable section of the sikh community which says it was tantamount to beadbi disrespect it has also emboldened him as he has got the support of anti social elements who now see him aspowerful leader capable of providing them protection from the police the self styled preacher who is fluent in english has attracted most of his following on the social media landed in the state amidstdeepening political vacuum the overcentury old shiromani akali dal sad which had always claimed to be the political voice of the sikhs has been in retreat in the wake ofstring of sacrilege and related police firing incidents during its tenure the radical outfits that have mostly worked within the framework of the constitution while keeping the demand for khalistan alive also appear to have run out of steam the congress appears to have been discredited and while the aap swept the february 2022 assembly polls bagging 92 of the statetotal 117 seats their legislators often face the charge of being lightweight with little sense of the statehistory or its political economy there has beengripe among the members of several higher education institutions that the stateyouth do not have anyone they can idolise armed with his fiery rhetoric centred onthree pronged pitch calling for drug eradication return topure form of sikhism and the need for khalistan due to injustices perceived or imaginary meted out to sikhs amritpal is trying to appeal to the gullible and disgruntled youth his focus on drugs and the largely unsubstantiated promise to cure addicts at his two drug rehabilitation centres is helping him expand the base of his followers advertisement at the same amritpalsudden rise has also sparked much speculation about his support system on the street people tell you agency da banda hai he is the product of an agency some say it could bebuild up to presidentrule but there are others who flag social media for fuelling his rise pointing out how he has been active on it for several years now stepping backlittle one would see that there were attempts to destabilise punjab during the initial years of the previous capt amarinder singh led congress government as well the national investigation agency nia had then said that the khalistan liberation force backed bypakistan agency had hatchedconspiracy to disturb the communal harmony in the state with eight targeted killings mostly of the bjp rss leaders between january

Times of India,electronics innovation undergoing change like minded nations should work together to shape future of tech mos it,new delhi minister of state for it rajeev chandrasekhar on saturday said there isfundamental reset underway in semiconductor electronics and innovation world order post covid and like minded nations need to work together oncooperative framework to shape the future of technology to safeguard citizens from online user harm india has defined the boundary conditions of openness safety and trust as well as accountability for platforms and companies to operate on the indian internet the minister said and hoped that with global cooperation these principles will findwider play among other nations chandrasekhar was speaking atpanel discussion on democracyeleven protecting our technology future at the raisina dialogue 2023 toquestion on internet shutdown in india the minister said that the internet shutdowns as percentage of the total number of online users in india as also the diversity or enormity of content ecosystem is among the smallest in the world moreover any internet shutdown or content takedown is lawfully prescribed and lawfully ordered by the government in exceptional circumstances under the law the minister explained post covid clearly the digital supply chains value chains innovation ecosystem and critical technologies ecosystem are undergoingdeep structural change and while there is indeedre ordering of the world order in semiconductors electronics and innovation no country is going to be able to do this alonefew years ago we allowed insenseconcentration of these technologies and these products and the supply chains around certain economies we blindly believed in the global economic system or the global system of trade and we have realised post covid that those hopes or beliefs were not terribly sound sothink the first is that there is this re ordering of the semiconductor world order electronics world order and innovation world order that is underway he said the minister advocatedcooperative framework among like minded countries in shaping the future of technology sothink what we are proposing in india and we ve been steadily arguing for this for some years now is that among like minded countries there ought to be more ofco operative framework whether through that co operative framework or prism you look at future tech critical tech regulating the internet the rules and go no go areas he said the minister asserted the post covid new world requiresmuch more institutional framework in how nations approach technologies and the future of tech in particular that is what we are doing that is what we believe in and we are looking at this re ordered new world order in semiconductors electronics and critical technologies in terms of partnerships with like minded nations he said there is no difference between democracy and digital democracy and the fundamental values for physical world and cyberspace are the same he said the fundamental rights of our citizens are exactly what we transpose and expect to be implemented and available on the cyberspace on the issue of internet shutdowns andthink there is this narrative thatbeing put out there deliberately because the numbers seem large but aspercentage of the total number of internet users in india and the diversity and the enormity of the content ecosystem the percentage is among the smallest in the world the minister said the laws have lagged behind innovation and progress and growth of big platforms he said observing that governments across the world are trying to catch up with that lag over the last ten years certainly in india we are trying to catch up very fast chandrasekhar said the minister observed that the relationship between governments and tech and governments and the internet is undergoingtectonic change there iscorrection in the way governments are responding to platforms and what the platforms mean in terms of good as also user harm and other issues for many years innovation was left unregulated because it was innovation so you suddenly found afterdecade of being left alone we suddenly have to deal with the so called problems of big tech he said india he said has clearly set the boundary conditions for platforms to operate which is that internet should be open it should certainly not be like the chinese internet internet should besafe and trusted space he said citing the this is important given that 800 million indians are using the internet and the number is set to rise to 1 2 billion indians by 2025 26 so the internet beingsafe and trusted space is an article of faith andduty for the government to deliver to its citizens and the third is accountability principle that regardless of whether you rebig tech headquartered inparticular land or nation if you do business in india you have to be accountable chandrasekhar said certain casted obligations of platforms operating in india are prescribed and enforced through the it rules we have got nine categories of content and information that are absolutely no go areas for platforms and there iscasted obligation on them that if they want to enjoy the immunity and safe harbor under our laws from prosecution and continue to pretend that they are not publishers they have to do these comply with rules on one to nine content issues ranging from csam child sexual abuse material to misinformation at the other end of spectrum he said while there is that predictable conversation about whether or not it infringes on freedom of speech or privacy our contention is that we will protect the fundamental rights of indian citizens but at the same time we haveduty to maintain that internet issafe and trusted space for all indians he said,"['new', 'delhi', 'minister', 'of', 'state', 'for', 'it', 'rajeev', 'chandrasekhar', 'on', 'saturday', 'said', 'there', 'isfundamental', 'reset', 'underway', 'in', 'semiconductor',

Sportstar,oc conducts controversy free wrestling selection trial but uncertainty remains over future role,alongside the eponymous death and taxes thereanother certainty of life at least in indian sports you canconductwrestling competition in india withoutmeasure of controversy contentious refereeing headstrong strong men wrestlers and coaches andunilateral decision making federation boss always made forcombustible combination something similar was still expected after the functioning of the wrestling federation of india wfi was suspended last month following unprecedented allegations of wrongdoing financial and otherwise made by top wrestlers against officials and three term president brij bhushan sharan singh and replaced instead with an oversight committee appointed by the ministry of sports the selection trials for the asian championships were the first major competition conducted by the six member committee headed by olympic bronze medalist boxer mc mary kom trouble began two days before the start of the trials when on the 6 th of march five wrestlers approached the courts seeking their inclusion in the tryouts while the protesting wrestlers were duly inducted there was still plenty of tension in the air heading into it police were deployed and spectators were kept tominimum athletes were only permitted to bring in two support staff even the media was discouraged on the first day to keep the number of non athletes and potential troublemakers down tominimum there was plenty of potential for that even the very specific venn diagram of selection trials held at new delhiindira gandhi stadium would throw uppolice complaint after supporters of one wrestler thrashed his opponent after an ill tempered contest in 2018 nevertheless for all their efforts the inevitable happened aftercontentious final second four point throw awarded to sagar won himmatch against sachin sehrawat in the men67kg greco roman category angry coaches of the latter stormed the mat accusations were made suggesting certain judges might have hadbias matters were not helped even afterreview due to inconclusive footage in the past wfi president brij bhushan who hadreputation for wielding the microphone and raining down instructions would have tried to makeunilateral decision and likely inflamed matters worse something similar happened at the commonwealth games selection trials last year also at the ig stadium whenproblematic decision in the menheavyweight category ended up withreferee slapped andwrestler suspended this time though the oversight committee represented on the day by captain retd rajagopalan former sai executive director and former olympic bronze medallist wrestler yogeshwar dutt cooled matters down by simply going by the book and referring the matter tounited world wrestling uww panel for precisely such situations the result came in half an hour later in favour of sagar and with the final decision being made by an international neutral body the protest too died away later on captain rajagopalan would suggest exactly how the situation had been handled we studied the uww rules of how the tournaments are organised once we knew there wasprecedent to handle suchsituation we went by that he suggested indeed but for the legal challenge prior to the tournament with players the selection trials largely passed off without incident unlike in the past bouts were not stopped midway for officials to pose for pictures with players there were no long stoppages of play due to coaches or wrestlers protests and there were no threats of violence from officials or competitorsfew of the senior athletes bajrang punia vinesh phogat and sakshi malik who had led the protests at jantar mantar which led to the initial suspension in the functioning of the federation didncompete at the selection trials but the others barring injury did compete in new delhi what the trials suggested is that it is indeed possible to conductlargely controversy free wrestling event it remains to be seen though what the future would bring the oversight committee is expected to present their fact finding report on the issues raised by the protesting wrestlers some time next week however it is uncertain when the sports ministry would act on the findings and what the role of the oversight committee would be in the functioning of the federation until then despitesuccessful trial not all members of the committee are looking forward to the continued responsibility the oversight committee was expected to deliver its fact finding report on the 23rd of february and that date was subsequently pushed back by another couple of weeks which have now passed we will have to continue being responsible for the day to day affairs of the wrestling federation of india until we are told to stop by the ministry of sport itnot something that is ideal because all of us have our regular jobs work is piling up there as well but this

The Indian Express,as cm sukhu goes about cancelling jai ram regime institutions congress bjp row hitsflashpoint,the face off between the sukhvinder singh sukhu led congress government and the opposition bharatiya janata party bjp over the shutdown of institutions continues to rage even as the latter is looking to turn up the heat on the government on the issue last week the congress government ordered the closure of 19 degree colleges adding them to the list of an estimated over 900 government institutions and offices opened during the previous jai ram thakur led bjp regime that the sukhu dispensation has denotified since taking the reins of the hill state three months ago over the last few weeks the bjp has stepped up its protests against the sukhu government against its continuing bid to close such institutions calling it arbitrary and anti development on its part the government has justified its move as necessary in public interest on mondaybjp delegation led by leader of opposition in the himachal assembly jai ram thakur and state bjp chief suresh kashyap submittedmemorandum to the newly appointed governor shiv pratap shukla against the closure of these institutions according to the memorandum over 900 government institutions opened during the jai ram regime have been closed by the congress government so far significantly one of the first decisions that sukhu took after taking charge as the cm on december 11 last year was to shut down institutions and offices notified or upgraded after april 1 2022 these entities belonged to various government departments and organisations including the pwd power finance police booths schools and healthcare units among others the sukhu government argued that these government entities had been notified by the bjp government arbitrarily as part of vote bank politics just ahead of the november 2022 assembly polls without providing financial resources for their establishment and operation it charged that these institutions existed just on paper and that no recruitments were made for them advertisement this immediately erupted inrow between the two sides with the bjp targeting sukhu for allegedly playing vendetta politics at the cost of public interest citing the instance of the governmentlatest move to close 19 degree colleges the sukhu camp said that each of them had less than 60 students the government also said the teachers and students in these colleges will be transferred to nearby institutions it is embarrassing that bjp was only concerned with playing politics it came to our notice that one of the degree colleges had only 4 enrolments it was then decided that they need to be shut down because they did not serve any purpose except political purpose said naresh chauhan principal media advisor to the cm we have even allowed institutions that have at least 60 students to operate the interests of students are primary for us and we will ensure that the opportunities for them are maximised advertisement in the budget session of the state assembly that got underway tuesday the treasury and opposition benches are set to take on each other fiercely on the row hitting out at the sukhu government jai ram charged several institutions that had been running forlong time have been shut down this shows that the government is only concerned with settling political scores they are not understanding that there issense of anger and discontent among the public if there is no option people will come to the streets to protest we will raise their voice and several other issues in the session as well in state political circles the closure of the institutions has been attributed to cm sukhubid to take strong decisions on various issues the bjp has however called sukhuweak cm

plea submitted by former punjab deputy chief minister sukhbir singh badal but granted it to former punjab chief minister parkash singh badal the court directed sukhbir to surrender before the illaqa duty magistrate within 15 days from the date of granting bail the badals had filed anticipatory bail applications in the case of the kotkapura firing incident of october 14 2015 which followed the incident of sacrilege on october 12 2015 in which torn pages of the sacred guru granth sahib from gurdwara burj jawahar singh wala were found on the streets of bargari village this followed successive incidents in whichguru granth sahib was stolen from the gurdwara on june 1 followed by another incident some months later in which posters with derogatory remarks about the sacred book were found pasted on the walls of bargari village on the intervening night of september 24 and september 25 the third incident on october 12 led to massive protests followed by heavy handed police action that has remainedpolitical issue in the state ever since police firing on that day in kotkapura alone had left around 60 people injured including over 30 cops the chargesheet was filed by an sit led by additional director general of police adgpk yadav on february 24 and march 6 mentioning all eight accused in the fir including the badals all of them have been issued notices to appear before the court of judicial magistrate first class ajaypal singh on march 23 the chief spokesperson of shiromani akali dal sad daljeet singh cheema said the party is exploring other legal options now that the bail application has been rejected we will approach the high court both the sad leadership and our supporters firmly believe that inclusion of the names of the former cm and his deputy in this fir is nothing but political vendetta by the ruling aam aadmi party aap but we have full faith in the judiciary and are sure this chargesheet too will face the same fate as that of the one earlier filed by former adgp kunwar vijay partap singh which was quashed by the punjab and haryana high court on april 9 2021 the counsel of the badals shiv kartar singh sekhon said statements of witnesses are the same as the ones in the reports of previous inquiries carried out by the justice zora singh commission the justice ranjit singh commission and the investigation by then adgp kunwar vijay partap singh the facts remain the same but they the sit under adgpk yadav have filednew report in their own way there is no new evidence against them the badals he added we are looking for further legal processes in sukhbircase and will pursue it accordingly the previous congress government had spent its five years in power harping on this sacrilege case rather than talking about development or other public issues now the aap government is doing the same thing justice needs to be ensured in the incident but indicting people for vendetta is unjustified said cheema advertisement even as the 2015 sacrilege and firing incidents continue to affect the political climate of the state since december 16 2021 an indefinite dharna has been going on at the site of the 2015 firing in behbal kalan from this site vidhan sabha speaker kultar singh sandhwan and cabinet minister kuldeep singh dhaliwal had separately announced around two months ago that the names of the badals would be added to the 2015 firing cases speaking about it cheema said when politicians make such claims even before the chargesheets are filed it shows that this is nothing but political vendetta let them do whatever they like they will also face the same fate as the congress in punjab sandhwan and dhaliwal had visited the dharna on different occasions to encourage the protesters to vacate the site the dharna was launched under the banner of bargari insaaf morcha by sukhraj singh niamiwala son of krishan bhagwan singh one of the two victims of the police firing at behbal kalan village that had followed hours after the firing at kotkapura on october 14 2015 to disperse another group of people blockingroad to protest the incidents of sacrilege advertisementchargesheet in the behbal kalan case will be filed soon dhaliwal had

democracy and this is not an individual battle of rahul gandhi what will be the fallout of this episode such politics will weaken democracy and the constitutional institutions democracy can be alive only if the opposition is alive do you think the politics of the country may takenew turn after this episode at this stage itnot appropriate to say where we will reach before the next lok sabha

The Indian Express,experts reckon peter bol alleged botched test could have potentially massive global ramifications guardian,the guardian reported that sport integrity australia and the government laboratory accused of botching peter bolanti doping test sample are staying silent as pressure builds and experts believe it could have potentially massive global ramifications the tokyo 2020 star and commonwealth games silver medallist bol had tested positive for synthetic erythropoietinperformance enhancing drug in january but last month hissample returned an atypical finding allowing bol to return to competition according to guardian details of two independent scientific reports commissioned by bollawyers became public on wednesday and both found no evidence of synthetic epo in bolsamples raising questions about testing methods used in his case epo isnaturally occurring hormone butsynthetic equivalent can aid performance and improve recovery inletter providing the reports to sia bollawyer peter greene described the body as completely wrong and called on it to end the investigation and admit its mistake according to australian guardian sia and the australian sports drug testing laboratorygovernment body which tests for sia stayed silent on wednesday refusing to respond to greeneallegations the guardian reported sia and asdtl declined multiple requests for comment the australian sports drug testing laboratory carries out testing on behalf of sport integrity australia the asdtl said it would not be appropriate to comment on an operational matter of sport integrity australia bolagent james templeton hit out at sia telling guardian australia he was disappointed it had not yet dropped the investigation and cleared the athletename sia are being disingenuous in stating that they are still investigating he said they have nothing to investigate advertisement templeton said sia had postponed an interview with bol in februarymonth after they had downloaded everything from his electronic devices they have nothing to ask him zero the agent added to guardian itdespicable to continue to throw shade on peter bol they donhave the good grace to properly clear his name observers are highlighting the international significance of wednesdaydevelopments sports integrity expert catherine ordwayresearch lead at the university of canberra and senior fellow at the university of melbourne law school told guardian there would be major ramifications if the world anti doping agency accepted the independent reports this is an international issue for wada she was quoted as saying by guardian it will impact the sydney lab and any of the other wada accredited labs doing epo testing it will impact previous epo cases and future epo analysis it is potentially massive and much bigger than australia advertisement but ordway suggested that more time was needed for wadaexpert group to review the independent reports and either concede that errors had been made or suggest an alternative explanation the information from bollawyers looks damning butm notscientist andm really keen to see what wada comes back with guardian spoke toprominent australian sports lawyer who requested anonymity to speak frankly about the saga calling the situationfarce they described it as the least likely of all the outcomes but certainly the best outcome for bolsake the lawyer addedhope sia drop this apologise and move on the allegedly botched testing was carried out by the asdtlwada accredited lab at the national measurement institute part of the federal department of industry the independent reports are highly critical of the testing methods used the first report by prof david chen at the university of british columbia guardian reported noted that the lab should have immediately recognised issues with the testing and followed the procedure described in the wada technical document td chen identified that another obvious phenomenon that should have been noticed but wasnis the intense band observed on one of the samples research has shown that people who have recently taken synthetic epo do not have high levels of naturally occurring epo the gel pattern showed very strong natural epo intensity indicating it did not come fromperson who recently used synthetic epo chen wrote in his report as reported by guardian advertisement the researcher was also critical of the poor quality of the standards chen concluded the reported finding ofpositive result was improper and did not meet the criteria required by the wada td the second report by norwegian researchers prof jon nissen meyer prof erik boye prof bjarne østerud and tore skotland made similarly critical findings the report said that we have carefully evaluated the documents that report the tests performed on peter bola sample and find no scientific evidence in this document which proves the presence of synthetic epo in bolurine advertisement chen was engaged independently bythird party and was kept unaware of the identity of bol as per guardian the norwegian experts were engaged directly by bollawyers but in an independent unpaid capacity,"['the', 'guardian',

riders the side having experimented with nine other opening combinations since 2019 without much success finally found the answer to its batting woes in powerplay overs in the unheralded all rounder from indore the arrival of iyer right after the five month covid induced hiatus was likewhiff of fresh air opening alongside shubman gill the 6 foot 4 inch tall left handed batter helped the team register back to back wins against virat kohliroyal challengers bangalore and archrival mumbai indians led by the exuberant rohit sharma he scored 41 not out vs rcb and 53 vs mi in that edition he ended up scoring 370 runs in 10 matches at an average of 41 11 his consistent performances didngo unnoticed and november 2021 was when iyer arguably lived his best 30 days immediately after being fast tracked into the indian white ball team for the new zealand series he was retained by kkr ahead of the following season the figure was 8 crore which translates tomind boggling 3900 per cent annual hike in his salary the grin says it allmoment to cherish for as he makes his debut bcci november 17 2021 all that cash besides of course making iyer way richer even changed his perspective life has changed inmanner whereve started looking at things more professionally obviously when you play more cricket you tend to bring professionalism into everything but thathow life has changed my approach towards the gameknow thathave to be precise and professional when it comes to each and everything and yeahve learnedlotnow feel thatneed to be more professional more focused thanever was he says the hefty investment however fetched modest returns in the first year iyeripl batting average dropped to 16 54 in 2022 his top score being an unbeaten half century against mumbai it was his only fifty of the season compared to the four he had clobbered in the previous iteration of the league even in india colours he failed to make heads turn in seven t20i innings he scored 133 in two odis he could only get 24 the hullabaloo had suddenly died down and he was dropped from the national side the knights however have decided to go ahead with him in the upcoming edition once again and iyer is thankful he says kkr has faith in me ascricket franchise they understand that you re not going to havegood season every time more than performances they are looking at the attitudeplayer brings to the team they look at the approach and see whether the guy is sincere and putting in the hard yardsfamiliar face in the kkr dugout might help iyer to quickly find his feet again the two time champion franchise has appointed chandrakant pandit who led madhya pradesh to its maiden ranji trophy title in 2022 as head coachhave worked with chandu sir at mp for about three years now itbeen an amazing

issue might not see the star batter return this season at all although it is being widely reported that the 28 year old has decided to delay his surgery and visit the national cricket academy nca to undergo periodic treatment in the meantime nitish rana has been asked to step in iyer wishes the senior iyer well lethope for the best more than the ipl or anything else we all want shreyas to be 100

says we re going to be ruthless this season as always kkr is known for playing aggressive cricket we have been givenclear template on how to go about our business chandu sir always emphasises on one thing when it comes to cricket and life that he wants us to be very disciplined iyer himself had been struggling with injuries last september he was hit on the neck bythrow from the bowler

Khel Now,why antim panghalrise should be cause of worry for ace wrestler vinesh phogat,wrestling the 19 year old competes in the same weight bracket as the veteran and recently won silver in the asian championships while vinesh phogat has established herself as one of the greatest female wrestlers from india antim panghal is making waves and is perceived to havebright future in the sport despite belonging to the same weight class the two wrestlers have been working on distinctive goals lately they are none other than three time commonwealth games gold medalist vinesh phogat and rising star antim panghal why has vinesh phogat been out of international events for vinesh the battle is not just about herself but evenmuch greater cause besides vinesh many indian wrestlers including tokyo olympics bronze medalist bajrang punia rio olympics medalist sakshi malik and sangeeta phogat led the sit in protest in delhijantar mantar on january 18 2023 against the wrestling federation of indiawfi president brij bhushan sharan singh accusing him and other coaches of sexual misconduct harassment and mental torture vinesh also stated that at least 10 to 20 girls have encountered sexual harassment at the wrestling camps the protest led to the stepping down of wfi president brij bhushan till the issue was resolved however elite wrestlers like vinesh bajrang and sakshi opted out from participating in international wrestling tournaments like the united world wrestling uww ranking series tournament until the indian sports ministryoversight committee submitted their report regarding the case on brij bhushan antim panghalperformance at the asian wrestling championships 2023 however vinesh phogat withdrawing her name from the international wrestling events implied that it was the perfect opportunity for antim panghal to becomestandout performer in the women53kg event antim exactly did so in the absence of her experienced compatriot she capitalized on all the chances with her fine performance in the national selection trials conducted under the supervision of the oversight committee at the indira gandhi arena she thus booked herselfspot in the asian wrestling championships 2023 at the asian wrestling championships 2023 the 19 year old antim lived up to the expectations by advancing to the finals of the women53kg on her way to the final she overcame the challenges from aktenge keunimjaeva in the semi final li deng in the quarter final and alvina lim during the qualifications in the final she facedstiff challenge from akari fujinami the reigning world champion and eventually lost by 0 10 to end up with the silver medal indian sports live coverage on khel now vinesh phogat vs antim panghal considering antimrise in the sport in suchshort span of time there is no doubt that the women53kg will be an anticipated clash in the coming times especially at the national level it is interesting to note that in the matchups held between antim and vinesh phogat the latter defeated the youngster on two occasions during the selection trials for commonwealth games 2022 the two wrestlers locked horns although antim was leading by 3 0 initially vinesh used her experience to turn the tables in her favour the next time the two wrestlers met at the national selection trials 2022 with the women53kg slot up for grabs for the world wrestling championships 2022 unlike last time vinesh was the stronger opponent right from the start as she defeated antim 7 0 by blocking all of her attacks and striking on the counter this came just two weeks after antim had scripted history for india becoming the first ever20 world champion will antimrise in the sport affect vinesh phogatchances although vinesh emerged as the better opponent in their previous encounters antim has shown tremendous potential invery short period this silver medal victory at the asian wrestling championships 2023 will surely add up to her confidence if vinesh continues to miss out on the selection trials antim will be rewarded with experience through her participation at international events against some top level wrestlers of the world the three time commonwealth games champion vinesh might also miss the opportunity to represent india at prestigious events like asian games 2022 if the sports ministry decides to send athletes based on their latest performance and records asresult she might lose out onchance to defend her asian games title as she was the gold medalist in the asian games 2018 held in jakarta indonesia for more updates follow khel now on facebook twitter

people as covid protests spreadbrief history of rare acts of dissent in china protests in china widespread protests are not common in china where the government heavily cracks down on any form of dissent so last novemberlarge scale demonstrations against nearly three years of snap lockdowns with some raising slogans like xi jinping step down and communist party step down were surprisingblaze at an apartment block in urumqi the capital of the western xinjiang region was behind the unusual wave of protests which spread across beijing shanghai and other regions many demonstrators held blank pieces of white papersymbol of defiance against the ruling partycensorship which led some to describing it as the a4 revolution the biggest protests in decades in the country which saw urban chinese students young people and workers hit the streets were mostly peaceful however some incidents of violence where people clashed with the police were reported the protests which eventually petered out had an impact as the government relaxed some lockdown protocols before abruptly scrapping the zero covid policy as per time magazine the government did not resort to repressive measures to quell these protests but adopted other nuisance measures such as checking phones and identity papers to discourage people from joining the marches the agitation showed that the state has learned valuable lessons about how most effectively to deter or demobilise protesters without resort to costly in terms of both resources and reputation and dangerous repression william hurst the chong hua professor of chinese development at the university of cambridge wrote for time magazine in december 2022 notably npr reported in january that the police were tacitly rounding up people they believed were behind the demonstrations they have also shown us that grievances have likely not been assuaged and if anything deeper issues have taken root in the hearts of many that could lead them to take bigger risks

Deccan Herald,is the up model that of bulldozers and encounters,atiq ahmed who was shot dead on live tv while in police custody wasdespicable character whomonce met atconstruction site in prayagraj then allahabad he was contesting in 2004 general elections andwas covering them accompanied then byfellow woman journalist both of us were distinctively uncomfortable surrounded bygangster and his henchmen and it washeightened experience that we have never forgotten there was no doubt we were engaging withpsychopathic violent killer for hire thus the grave discomfort is not over ahmed being dead but at what the extra judicial killing reveals about the nationlargest state uttar pradesh the men who pulled the guns and shot the gangster did so in the presence of policemen and media the shooters are seen in videos and reported in media as shouting jai shri ram as they surrender to the police invideo interview to the media the distraught mother of one of the three shooters describes her son asdeeply religious who did darshans and sang bhajans in another interview the father describes his son asdrug addict the police fir reportedly says that the three shooters have said during interrogation that they wanted to kill the gangster and his brother to become popular presuming the police version is to be believed and the episode was notset up tough questions about the breakdown of law and order in uttar pradesh remain this execution can be seen as an escalation of due process of law being ignored in the state chief minister yogi adityanath is described as bulldozer baba as bulldozers are now used against whomsoever the government sees as trouble makers this is popular with sections of society as some of the targets whose homes and businesses have been bulldozed are feared individuals and social oppressors also read appalling state of affairs in prayagraj frequently bulldozers are also used against the weak and inconvenient such as protesting members of the minority community escalating prejudice against muslims is nowpart of state craft in the bjp bastion this is the uttar pradesh model the template for governance in the state ispitched hindutva on every possible front enrolment of young men in the ranks of militia style groups who would be enforcers of the state ideology and incite fear in opponents this is combined with the doling of free rations very efficiently necessary to offset the inability of the state to provide jobs or genuine economic growth given the polarised politics endemic violence itunlikely any significant industry would move to the interiors since real socio economic justice cannot be given there isneed to provide spectacles of instant justice from bulldozers to now apparently public murders therefore the state finance minister suresh khanna said an hour after the assassination that ita judgement decision from the heavens the heavens are apparently kind to the dons in the bharatiya janata party bjp there is for instance the party mlc from mirzapur vineet singh as tough and nasty as gangsters can be there is brajesh singh of varanasi who spent years in jail but is now out and known to back bjp candidates he began his career assharpshooter of the dawood ibrahim gang of the mumbai underworld fame but is currently arguablydesh bhakt gangster there is of course brij bhushan sharan singh six term mp five terms in the bjp and the chief of the wrestling federation of india wfi whom award winning wrestlers recently accused of sexual harassment the scandal broke in january and an inquiry was supposed to have been completed inmonth but itapril now besides many gangsters surviving radicalised youth and celebration of instant justice makelethal cocktail there are fears expressed by ordinary citizens beyond minorities who wonder if any dispute or disagreement with those in power can have violent consequences should political opponents start worrying that some radicalised youth will come after them to become popular in the short term however there is no electoral damage to the bjp the countdown has begun for the urban local bodies elections that will take place on may 4 and 11 for 760 municipal bodies and mayors will be elected to 17 corporations there is no real challenge to the bjp comfortably winning these elections the results will be announced on may 13 the same day the results from the

counterparts rublev plays withcustomized version of the head gravity pro and like many pros has added weight to the frame this has allowed him to gain more power and stability not only that but adding weight to oneracket also helps with transmitting less shock thanlighter racket however this does lower the rate at whichplayer can swing their racket and it also reduces the amount of topspin they can put on the ball dimitrov plays withstandard wilson pro staff 97s the racket offers many benefits to the bulgarian star like his power and ability to spin the ball however it does offerdownside as it is considered to havehefty swing we can see in the video the importance of having the right racket as we see rublev and dimitrov struggle to match their usual strike speed the pair brought us an

The Shillong Times,atique ahmed killing rule of law not religion matters,by rajdeep sardesai in uttar pradeshnotorious gang wars even crime is seen through the prism of caste and community which is why the sharply polarized reactions to the killing of criminal politician atiq ahmad and his brother ashraf in police custody and in the full glare of live tv cameras by jai shri ram chanting assassins should come as no surprise while senior bjp ministers in up have defended the cold blooded murder as karmic retribution opposition leaders have been just as strident in their denunciation of the yogi adityanath government aimim mp asaduddin owaisi even went as far as likening the case to the gruesome murder of ehsan jafri during the 2002 gujarat riots the celebratory note struck by right wing internet hindu groups on social media is deeply troubling is atiqmurder in brazen violation of the rule of law justified because he ismafia leader who happens to also bemuslim atiqprojection asmuslim gangster is not an exception in 2020 when gangster vikas dubey was killed in an encounter with the up police social media narratives revolved around an element of brahmin pride and victimhood the yogi government then was attacked for killingbrahmin bahubali strongman the yogi government in fact has been routinely accused of being partial to thakur gang leaders with the samajwadi party media cell even coming up withlist of alleged criminals who are reportedly flourishing only because they belong to the same caste as the chief minister the brahmin versus thakur gang rivalries are not new in purvanchal or eastern uttar pradesh nor are the muslim versus hindu gang battles in the 1980s gorakhpur was the epicenter of an infamous gang war between brahmin don hari shankar tiwari and thakur don virendra pratap shahi while shahi was murdered in 1997 tiwari probably the first politician to win an election from jail went on to becomekey minister in several up governments cutting across party lines likewise the war in the varanasi ghazipur belt between mukhtar ansari and brijesh singh gangs both again led by criminals turned politicians has assumeddistinct muslim versus hindu character singhsupporters even branding him asdesh bhakt don what explains this unique caste community crime and politics nexus in up rewind to the late 1980s as the congress began to decline in up in the face of the mandal mandir twin challenge between 1993 and 2017 up only threw up one single party majority government the mayawati led bahujan samaj party in 2007 for almostquarter ofcentury unstable coalitions were the norm every seat mattered and winnability mattered above all else the criminal dons had the clout and resources to win seats in their areas of influence often even when contesting as independents where once the criminals were dependent on politicians for patronage rickety coalitions ensuredrole reversal aroundthird of upmlas had criminal cases against them in the 1990s secondly the aggressive mandalisation of politics where caste identities determined voting preferences meant that political parties were constantly searching for mascots of key caste groupscaste badge was more important thancharacter or education certificate for example when bandit queen phoolan devi was givenlok sabha ticket from the samajwadi party sp in 1996 her mallah or fisherfolk caste identity wascrucial factor in her selection the sp was looking to widen its yadav base to include other backward castes phoolan who was later assassinated went on to win her first election by more than 30 000 votes thirdly post the babri masjid demolition in 1992 religion became deeply entwined with upcoarsened vote bank politics where once upgangs were seen as secular in their composition the religious divide was now acute each gang leader brought along with him the guarantee of their communityvote mulayam singhyadav muslim vote bank meant that the likes of atique found refuge in the samajwadi party contesting and winning on an sp ticket in 1996 from allahabad west having won twice previously as an independentmayawati also competing for the muslim vote made another criminal strongman in mukhtar ansari her posterboy calling himmessiah of the poor the bjp in turn provided space for the likes of brij bhushan sharan singh once accused of sheltering dawood ibrahimaides ironically dawoodgang too wasmixed one until the 1993 mumbai blasts divided the mumbai underworld too finally upgang culture must also be located within the political economy of the state especially in purvanchalregion beset with poverty and backwardness private entrepreneurship has never really taken off here this has increased the dependence on state funding and government contracts through political patronage guns are often available more easily than jobs and crime is seen aslucrative form of illegal capital accumulation kidnapping extortion land grabbingparallel economy has revolved around the bahubalis and their political affiliations when he first came to power in 2017 yogi adityanath vowed to finish this mafia raj agar apradh karenge toh thok diye jayenge if they commit crimes we will knock them down was the blunt message fromsaffron robed neta ironically himself once accused of leading his own private vigilante army more recently he warned in the up assembly that maafiyao ko mitti mein mila denge we will destroy the mafias these hard hitting one liners are designed to boost his tough on law and order strongman imagekey factor in his re election success last year they have also providedcover to the police to pursue with complete impunity an encounter raj where the men in khaki havelicence to kill the up police only last week boasted of having gunned down 183 alleged criminals in the course of nearly 11 000 encounters in the last six years this thok do policy must surely have its limits while atiquekilling may yield political dividends in upcommunally surcharged milieu it has dangerously short circuited the criminal justice system asfeared gangster with over100 cases against him atique deserves no sympathy he did deserve though like anyone else muslim or hindu the assurance of due process post script atmedia event last year when yogi adityanath was asked about gangster vikas dubeycar mysteriously over turning leading to him being killed in an encounter the chief minister shrugged it off by remarking accidents do happen the audience clapped is atiquekilling also to be seen as an accident and be similarly celebrated the writer is senior

First India,veterans capital gains warner ishant star in delhifirst win of ipl season,new delhi skipper david warner found his perfect hitting arc after ishant sharma rolled back the years but even then delhi capitals stuttered badly inmodest chase before beating kolkata knight riders by four wickets on thursday to stay afloat in this edition of the ipl with their backs to the wall after five defeats on the trot the dc bowling line up collectively came to the party as kkr managed only 127 onspicy deck which aided both pacers and spinners alike warner dcbest batter this season was struggling with his strike rate in earlier games but on thursday he smashed 57 off 41 with the target being reached with four balls to spare the dc batting save warner looked wobbly once again butbelow par score perhaps saved the day for the home team as the ball started gripping in the second half of the chase making it difficult for strokeplay axar patel 19 not out off 22 balls despitegroin strain managed to take his team past the finishing line dcvictory was about two veterans winning the powerplay contest for their team the 34 year old ishant 2 19 in 4 overs who is well past his prime got his first opportunity and used his oodles of experience to peg back kkr inside the bowling powerplay the 36 year old warner then showed his destructive avatar hitting as many as 10 boundaries in the batting powerplay to kill the contest and earn his teamfirst win of the competition the manner in which he swept the two kkr spinners sunil narine and anukul roy hardly had any answers in all he hit 11 boundaries the win doesnalter dcstanding in the points table as they remain last but the victory does give them hope forturnaround once warner wongood toss and opted to field ishant playing his first ipl match in over two seasons was bang on target with 13 dot balls and hitting those immaculate three quarter lengths just like yesterday in rhythm he still hits 140 clicks but once he was done with his four overs he literally collapsed in the dug out chair as prithvi shaw came in as impact player his india days are well over and ishant certainly would like to remain an ipl to ipl player till his body allows him to take rigours of top flight cricket mukesh kumar 1 34 in 4 overs also bowled well in the powerplay while axar 2 13 in 3 overs who hasnenjoyed favourable match ups against left handers removed the dangerous rinku singh as kkr lost wickets in clumps if ishant mukesh and axar were brilliant in the front 10 kuldeep yadav 2 15 in 3 overs who got jason roy 43 off 39 balls was brilliant as he created doubts in the minds of the batters by varying his pace the pitch hadliberal tinge of green and anrich nortje 2 20 in 4 overs bowled an ideal test match length and the grass covering helped inbit of deviation as in form venkatesh iyer just managed to dangle his bat and the ball flew to mitchell marsh standing at first slip it was undoubtedly the ball of the innings but credit goes to ishant as he didnlet roy get away withgood start the bit of moisture afterdelayed start due to steady drizzle had also freshened up the track and the bit of extra bounce found the batters inbit ofproblem mukesh got rid of litton das who miscuedpull and the ball that ishant bowled to dismiss nitish rana reared up and he couldncheck his lofted shot however the wicket that completely changed the course was rinkuslog sweep and the ball bounced tad extra to take the top edge and flew atcomfortable height for lalit yadav to catch it at deep square leg once rinku was gone kkr batting unit seemed like losing the battle in its head as andre russell 38 not out off 31 balls despite hitting four sixes couldndo enough to get his team topar score which was

The Wire,who is bjp mp brij bhushan sharan singh at the heart of serious charges by wrestlers,new delhihave committedmurder in the past let people say what they wantdid commitmurder this is not the confession ofconvicted criminal butbold declaration made by brij bhushan sharan singhbjp leader and six time lok sabha mp who has never been tried for murder though tales of the muscle power wielded by singh the mp from the kaiserganj lok sabha seat in bahraich district of uttar pradesh are well known especially in gonda and its surrounding districts it is likely that no one knew that singh had committedmurder until an interview he gave toweb portal in 2022 his affidavit submitted for the 2019 lok sabha elections did mention four criminal cases including one under indian penal code ipc section 307 attempt to murder and other serious crimes singh has also been the president of the wrestling federation of india wfi since 2011 and there are allegations that he often resorts to the use of muscle power in running the federation asresult of his tyrannical attitude olympic level wrestlers were forced to holdprotest against him stagingdharna at delhijantar mantar from january 18 the protestors made serious allegations against singh including sexual harassment of women wrestlers physical abuse dictatorial functioning and financial irregularities in the management of wfi the players called off the protest afterlate night meeting with sports minister anurag thakur on january 20 in which they were given an assurance that singh would be relieved of his duties as wfi president and an inquiry committee would be set up now saying that they have lost faith in the committee the wrestlers are back on protest they have filedpolice complaint against singh which also includes allegations of sexual assault onminor however the police are yet to register an fir and the protesting wrestlers have said they will not leave jantar mantar until an fir is filed they have even approached the supreme court on the matter meanwhile regarding the allegations levelled against him singh claimed that he would hang himself if the charges were found to be true he refused to resign from his post as president calling the allegations politically motivated and terming itcongress sponsored protest he even warned that if he opened his mouth it would bringtsunami he compared the wrestlers protest with the shaheen bagh protest and added thatfew players whose careers are over are levelling allegations against him however singh who calls the protesting sportspersons as pawns of the congress does not haveslate as clean as he pretends while he himself proclaimed on camera that he has committedmurder on another occasion he reportedly confessed that former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee had held him responsible for another murder the many crimes of brij bhushan sharan singh ahead of the 2014 lok sabha elections scroll had quoted senior journalists from gonda district as saying that singhinvolvement in crime in the 1980s ranged from motorcycle bike theft to running liquor shops he even used to get boys to hunt for coins lying at the bottom of temple ponds soon he becamecivil contractor vinod kumar singh alias pandit singhformer minister in the samajwadi party cabinet in up was his associate in all these activities later brij bhushan and pandit singh turned from friends to foes and in 1993 brij bhushan was charged under ipc sections 307 attempt to murder 147 spreading nuisance 148 possessing deadly weapon and 149 offence committed by every member of an unlawful assembly with common object for shooting at pandit singh pandit singh had claimed in an interview to scroll that 20 bullets were fired at him and he was hospitalised for 14 months in the case which lasted for 29 years brij bhushan was acquitted in december last year due to the lack of evidence however the court pulled up the investigators saying that during the investigation no effort was made to collect evidence and even the weapon used in the crime could not be recovered in his defence brij bhushan had argued that he was in delhi at the time of the attack in response the judge said that no effort was made by the investigators to verify this claim which makes the entire investigation questionable pandit singh the victim in the case died in may 2021 after contracting covid 19 aboutyear andhalf before the verdict one of the reasons for brij bhushanacquittal in this case was that pandit singh did not appear to recordstatement against him when asked why in an interview in 2014 the latter replied ifdecide to testify against brij bhushan in the 1993 firing casecan get him behind bars buthave restrained myself from doing so becausewant to keep him alive it is fun to fight withstrong person you stay alert and donmake mistakesdid commitmurder pandit singh hadbrother ravinder singh who wasvery close friend of brij bhushanboth of them were contractors and used to work together once they had gone to holdpanchayat meeting where shots were fired in the air and one bullet hit ravinder while he was standing next to brij bhushan it enraged bhushan so much that he snatched the rifle from the hands of the person who had fired the shot and shot him the person died on the spot this incident was narrated by brij bhushan himself in an interview to the online portal lallantop in the interview he saidhave committedmurder in the past whatever people may saydid commitmurderimmediately shot and killed the person who had shot ravinder dead he further said in the interview that lallu singh who is currently the bjp mp from the faizabad lok sabha seat in ayodhya district iswitness to the incident he added that some time after the incident he was sent to jail under the gangster act by veteran leader and former minister of gonda kunwar anand singh former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee had also suspected bhushan of committing another murder the latter confessed after the death of the bjp candidate of gonda lok sabha seat the former prime minister had said you got him killed brij bhushan issix time mp winning five times onbjp ticket and once in 2009 on an sp ticket he won the first two elections in 1991 and 1999 from the gonda lok sabha seat in the 2004 lok sabha elections the bjp gave himticket from balrampur and nominated ghanshyam shukla from gonda shukla died inroad accident on the day of polling recalling it inconversation with scroll brij bhushan said my opponents spread rumours that it was not an accident butmurder atal ji called me and said marwa diya you got him killed brij bhushan added that this led to his differences with the bjp asresult he made headlines by cross voting against his own party incrucial confidence motion by the opposition against the then united progressive alliance upa government in 2008 the bjp expelled him but the sp opened its doors for him he was elected mp from kaiserganj lok sabha seat in 2009 on an sp ticket in 2014 he rejoined the bjp and again became an mp from kaiserganj repeating his victory in 2019 as well it is noteworthy that he remained in the bjp even after the then prime minister had expressed his suspicion of that bhushan had murderedbjp candidate the bjp expelled him only after his cross vote however brij bhushanpolitical clout remained unaffected despite his confession of having committedmurder and being accused of another murder by the then pm both the bjp and the opposition sp embraced him and covered up his crimes as he continued to get tickets and win election after election for more thandecade he has been the president ofnational sports association according to the indian express he likes to be referred to as powerful and believes that he doesnneed the bjp as much as the bjp needs him in his home district of gonda in uttar pradesh and at least halfdozen adjoining districts he wieldslot of influencelocal bjp leader from gonda told the newspaper brij bhushan only borrows the party symbol he doesnneed it to win the election he wins them on his own he has more than 50 educational institutions running in bahraich gonda balrampur ayodhya and shravasti districts of up which is alsosource of his political domination in the region something he admits he saiddid not establish them college with any political motive but today boys rally around me people may call me mafia but my students idolise me earlierused to touch the feet of brahmins today young brahmins touch my feet calling me guruji this is the reason why brij bhushan who maintainsstature bigger than the party in the region challenges his own party and its decisions with hardly any adverse consequences in october last year while targeting the bjp government in up he said that he had never seen such poor management of floods and that people are at godmercy onquestion asked regarding chief minister adityanath he said donmake me say anything in addition he even praised sp leader azam khan the biggest thorn in the bjpside in up by calling himleader of the people in june last year when maharashtra navnirman sena mns chief raj thackeray expressed his desire to visit ayodhya brij bhushan went against the party line and opposed thackerayvisit attime when the bjp was considering mns as an ally duringtumultuous phase of maharashtrian politicswill not allow raj thackeray who insulted north indians to enter ayodhya until he apologises to all north indians with folded hands he claimedrequest chief minister yogi adityanath to not meet him the rss the vishwa hindu parishad and the common man playedrole in the ram mandir movement the thackeray family has nothing to do with it he also launchedtirade against yoga guru and businessman ramdev accusing his company patanjali of selling spurious ghee and warned him ofnationwide agitation against patanjaliproducts terming him the king of adulteration he also called upon the sant community to stand against ramdev and appealed to the centre as well as the up and uttarakhand governments to take action against the latter brij bhushan singhimage ofstaunch hindutva leader also corresponds with the political ideology of the bjp his controversial remarks for instance about the ancestors of aimim chief asaduddin owaisi calling them hindu only help the bjpcause this is perhaps why his defiance against the party is largely ignored by the top brass brij bhushanlong tryst with controversies brij bhushan joined the bjp in the late 1990s having studied law at the awadh university it was the era of the ram janmabhoomi movement and he caught the bjpeye because of his good standing in the areas around ayodhya today his wife ketki devi singh is the gonda district panchayat president while his son prateek bhushan singh is the mla from gonda sadar seat brij bhushan was one of the prominent faces of the ram mandir movement and was also arrested along with senior bjp leaderk advani murli manohar joshi and former chief minister kalyan singh in the babri demolition case in which he was the main accused in 2020 the court acquitted all the accused including brij bhushan in an attempt to cash in on his image asstaunch hindutva leader he boasts during the movementwas the first person from the area to be arrested by mulayam singhwas also the first person arrested by the cbi after the controversial structure was demolished in the mid 1990s his relationship with the underworld also came to the fore he spent several months in tihar jail on charges of harbouring members of the dawood ibrahim gangcase was registered against him under the terrorist and divisive activities prevention act tada he was later acquitted due to the lack of evidence while he was in jail his wife contested on the bjp ticket from gonda lok sabha seat and won in 2004 brij bhushan22 year old son shakti singh died by suicide leavingsuicide note in which he blamed his father brij bhushan for the act you could not prove to begood father you did not take care of my siblings and me you always thought about yourself and did not care about us we see our future in darkness thatwhy there is no point in living now the note read tyrannical attitude as wrestling federation head in managing the wfi brij bhushan has often been accused of beingself centred narcissist which is also reflected in his remarks for instance he reportedly said in an interview to the indian express in 2021 they wrestlers are strong boys and girls you need someone strong to control them is there anyone stronger than me here the report stated how his is the final word in every matter related to wrestling in the federation he keeps an eye on every minor and major wrestling tournament and often gives instructions to the referee and even punishes the judges referring tofew standout anecdotes about his dictatorial attitude the report said that he suspendedrailway coach duringnational championship in noida in january 2021 he asked the referee to penalisewrestler from delhi because the wrestlersupporters had entered the playing arena the referee said there was no such rule but singh insisted upon it if he is unable to be physically present attournament he monitors it from home by getting cameras installed everywhere at the venue something he himself admitted the report further added that the wrestlers are well aware of brij bhushanattitude therefore when they lose incontroversial match instead of going to the judge they appeal directly to him meanwhile scenes of wrestlers bowing before brij bhushan and seeking blessings from him are also common during the matches of the national championship in indian wrestling his influence is such that he recently lashed out at the union governmenttarget olympic podium top scheme for the preparation of athletes for olympics and asked the government not to directly approach the athletes under this scheme meanwhile after the tokyo olympics last year he had said that the federation would keep an eye on private non profit organisations supporting wrestlers speaking to the printformer sports authority of india coach said brij bhushan is the goon that wrestling needs without him it would be very difficult to discipline or keep wrestlers under control his hooliganism was witnessed in 2021 duringjunior level wrestling tournament in ranchi when he started hittingwrestler on stage brij bhushan sharan singh the president of the federation of india slappedwrestler from up on the stage during the first round of the under 15 national wrestling championship the quint december 17 2021 dronacharya awardee mahavir phogat had also told the media in detail about singhattitude in running the federation and claimed that apart from interfering with the diet of the wrestlers he also takes half of the sponsorship money they receive translated from hindi by naushin rehman read the hindi original here,"['new', 'delhihave', 'committedmurder', 'in', 'the',

The Indian Express,wrestlers allege threats financial inducements to seven women including minorfamily to withdraw complaints against brij bhushan sharan singh,the countrytop grapplers protesting at jantar mantar said that threats of dire consequences and inducements of money were being made to the seven woman wrestlers who filed separate complaints of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation against wrestling federation of india president brij bhushan sharan singh alsobjp member of parliament from kaiserganj on the third day of the protest two time world championship medallist vinesh phogat said threats were being made to break the resolve of the complainants tokyo olympics bronze medallist bajrang punia accused singhcoterie of threatening the family of the minor one of the seven complainants they are trying to threaten the minor victim and pressure is being put on the family members to withdraw the complaint we have learned that one of the people threatening them iscoach who isdronacharya award winner and the other is the secretary of the haryana wrestling association they went to her house and are putting pressure on the family and also offered money they want her to take the complaint back those women wrestlers who have filed complaints against the wfi president are being threatened too bajrang said at jantar mantar on tuesday the complaints were filed on friday at the connaught place police station in new delhi and it is learnt that the wrestlers have cited multiple instances of sexual harassment dating back to 2012 and as recent as 2022 what is unfortunate vinesh said is that the names of the victims who registered the complaints at the police station seem to have been leaked to the wfi president ifgirl makescomplaint of sexual harassment what should the police do there needs to be an fir an arrest should be made under pocso the protection of children from sexual offences act but why have the police not done these basic things so far and now the complainants are being threatened and being asked to withdraw the case vinesh said unlike in january when they sat in protest till dusk and returned the next morning this time the wrestlers including rio olympics bronze medallist sakshi malik are spending the night at jantar mantar the protesting wrestlers have said they have lost faith in the oversight committee set up by the sports ministry to probe the allegations of sexual harassment against the wfi president the report of the oversight committee headed by boxing legend mary kom has not been made public despite the one month deadline expiring by the end of february the government on monday shared the major findings of the oversight committee but remained silent on the charges against the wfi president advertisement inletter to indian olympic association ioa president and former sprint queen pt usha the sports ministry mentioned only the structural lapses within the wfi including the absence of an internal complaints committee and called for effective communication between the federation and the sportspersons the ministry also declared the ongoing process for the wfi elections scheduled to take place on may 7 as null and void and directed the ioa to form an ad hoc committee no going back hamare saath game ho gaya we were fooled the last time we believed we would get justice and that is why we ended the protest after three days but this time we wonget swayed by false promises till the investigation is taken to its conclusion and arrests are made based on the complaints we will not stop protesting we have faith in the supreme court vinesh said the wrestlers made it clear that just filing an fir against the accused was not enough advertisement we wonend our protest when an fir is lodged he the wfi president has to be arrested and put behind bars so many people roam around freely despite an fir being lodged against them will we be safe if he is free and how will we train if he is roaming free vinesh said between meeting politicians from different parties members of farmer unions and khap leaders the wrestlers had sought the support of political parties and womenorganisations on monday indeparture from their earlier stand former haryana chief minister bhupinder singh hooda communist party of india leader and former rajya sabha mp brinda karat and aam aadmi party spokesperson reena gupta were among those who met the wrestlers on tuesday the question is why those athletes who should have been atstadium are being forced to sit in protest at jantar mantar there needs to bethorough investigation into the matter the athletes need to get justice and my full support is with them hooda tweeted local leaders from haryana and western uttar pradesh who were involved in the farmer protests also came forward with the promise of hundreds of supporters travelling to jantar mantar over the next few days earlier in january we didnwant the people from political parties to come to the protest site because then people would say we are trying to play politics but after that we were fooled we have asked everyone to come including politicians farmers and khap leaders because people want to support us and are fighting for the self respect and dignity of women wrestlers this is not about uttar pradesh versus haryana the up haryana story is being spread by those who want us to fail and those who are close to brijbhushan sharan singh vinesh said advertisement by evening there waspower failure at the protest site as the microphones fell silent and the fans stopped working whatever happens we will be here at jantar mantar night and day till our women wrestlers get justice jitender an asian wrestling championship silver medallist said,"['the', 'countrytop', 'grapplers',

The Indian Express,vinesh phogat at idea exchange when women raise their voices they are targeted first,the sports minister and the government are doing some good for sportsagree that funding has been good and facilities have improved but the respect for athletes is the same as before in their eyes when we get medals they get photos clicked to show they are proud of us but the reality is quite different and for women iteven more difficult those involved in the system wonder howwoman can speak so much against the system they arenhappy when women talk against the system when other athletes raise their voices when it comes to trials etc itokay but when women raise their voices they are targeted first they ask how did we get so much courage to speak against the system they say something but in their heart there is something else and they portray something totally different how we were being treated earlier itthe same thereno change in that aspect nihal koshie how difficult was it for the victims and you to take that step it was difficult to explain to the girls families to explain to ourselves and those around us that we ve started this fight and have to continue we were scared too we fear the police the first day when we took all the girls and went to the police station with the complaints we feared the police so much because we had not faced them before advertisement yes we do have family members in the police but we ve never faced them in suchsituation we didnknow how the cops talk at the police station or how they behavehave not yet received the fir copywill speak onceve received the fir copy says brijbhushan sharan singh president wrestling federation of india on wrestlers protest against him and firs registered by delhi police pic twitter com fvu1fxki35 ani april 29 2023 the ministry told us to give them time and they would file an fir according to the results of their finding they told us not to worry about anything and that they would do everything now we think that we should have filed an fir at that time itself and not waited actually we didnhave courage at the time to file an fir because we were wondering what would happen and whom would we have to explain to media also sometimes troubles the victim by asking questions about the incident and what proof do we have the families are also scared wondering what their children are talking about openly advertisement we got fired up and started this fight we thought it wasmistake to take on the system we could ve just not bothered and been happy wrestlingmeancan compete for another four five yearsll compete at the paris olympics for sure the family is crazy for an olympic medal and just before that we are protesting so many situations have risen but somewhere we have found the courage the fire for justice doesndie we know that we will get support from somewhere god is not stone hearted to see us struggle and fight so much and then make us suffer nihal koshie what led you to file an fir now to be honest we didnplan to file the fir and those who we are against never expected us to file the fir either they thought that if we actually wanted to file an fir we would have filed it then as female athletes they knew the problem or perhaps were trying to ignore it on purpose they took advantage of our situation they knew we were scared and respected people after the fir itlike telling people that we are truthful we have done nothing wrong itgood to get so much support we have fought for smaller things not for suchbig thingbelieve in god and that he hasplan for everything we have fought so much and he ll not let it go to waste hein control of everything his plans are executed through us mihir vasavda you could ve finished your career comfortably gone to olympics brij bhushantenure as president was also getting over what was the thinking behind picking up this fight now actually at trials and competitions where brij bhushan used to be there he would say things likell be in wrestling for another 20 years we thought this is not going to stop if he continues for 20 years so many wrestlers will come into the sport and he ll still be around in my family too girls are getting into wrestling they will becertain age but brij bhushan will still be around we tolerated somehow and got out of the situation with courage but what if the new athletes doneven reach that level where they ll be heard that was worrying that hehere for the long haul he considers it his fiefdom and everyone will be crushed under his feet he ll do whatever he feels like advertisement mihir vasavda how was it dealing with the federation officials how doexplain this supposehave to go late to the national camp for that you have to call assistant secretary vinod tomar tomar will ask neta brij bhushan thenhave to ask the chief coach he will ask for an application even if nothing is in his hands then tomar wonpick up the call the next day if heangry with me he ll issueshow cause notice if my family has to getcertificate signed forcash award from the haryana government ifm not around they woneven sign and will demand the athlete comes herself they ll keep troubling for the smallest of things they ll act obnoxiously and threaten by using the netaname the treatment was awful eventea seller there had this attitude that who the hell are youam the boss even the water boy hadlot of attitude advertisement the way any athlete would be treated when we were going for any competition and the facilities given to us would be of zero quality we would mail asking them to send us two days in advance or forphysio that we need desperately or to give usgood coach itnot like we can wrestle till 50 years our career span is small half of it goes in gaining experience and when we are experienced these people donsupport us we would be more exhausted dealing with them rather than in training or competition athletes are of no value in their eyes mihir vasavda you have madelot of comments about the federation sports ministry and sports authority of india if the solution is reached to your satisfaction how easy or difficult will it be for you to makereturn to top level competitions thata difficult question we are thinking about what the situation can be in the future but now that we have put our hand in the lionmouth why be afraid if we donsay anything then too we will be targeted and if we open our mouths something bad will happen to us so letsay it and face the consequences advertisement also read an idol crumbles how pt usha missed the podium again we know that we will face tough times even if we win this fight not just during our careers even after that attempts will be made to remove any trace of our name and achievements from the sporting world and the sports community but why care about those people and their feelings who have never achieved anything ifhave wonmedal that is registered in history they canerase it shivani naik wrestling hasculture of giving respect of listening to and following everything that people in authority say was that culture misused when brij bhushan was new in wrestling he used to respect any good and upcoming wrestler but as he started gettingfirm foothold he began to show his true colours iffew wrestlers were good friends and training well together he would send his own people there to break their friendship he used to practise divide and rule policy most wrestlers come from haryana punjab and maharashtra and are big on respect brij bhushan has taken undue advantage of thatwould also blame athletes as we stayed silent forlong time and toleratedlot if we had drawnline earlier things wouldnhave come to this athletes would have faced difficulty in drawingline against the system there is not one brij bhushan but several how can we fight against so many but if we can successfully deal with one that will bebig thing in itself sandeep dwivedi winning an olympic or world championship medal takeslifetime of effort but no upcoming athlete would know how to counter these other challenges what will be your message to them the tough journey is appreciated only by an athlete and their family the toughest sports are taken up by those from the lower income level families who are used to hardships and difficulties they think that they donhave anything and so have no option but to work hard they donhaveplanthey only know they have to go ahead also read for wrestlers protesting against wfi chief day and night bouts at jantar mantar the craze of wrestling and other sports is growing especially in haryana people sell off their land to fund this dream to fundyoungstertraining diet and participation in competitions to ensure that they stay fit and healthy parents even stay awake with them they save money to accompany them to competitions if they donhave money they borrow it thinking they will repay it infew months they put everything in it in the hope that if their child becomestop athlete they will get everything money prestige social status thinking about all this we thought what will come out of this struggle even if we are successful what will be our future we knew we would perish regardless of whether we fought or not but we thought that if we fought and won we could form something better but if we didnfight we would have hadregret in life that we didneven try sandeep dwivedi what gives you the strength to keep going on we donknow from where we are getting the strengthdonknow if we are actually normal or we are acting to be normal we have stopped feeling anything we doneven know where the path we have chosen will lead us there are so many obstacles along the way if we clear one hurdle something else will come up but yes if all the athletes come together if they gather the strength that we have to fight then no one can do anything to an athlete not just wrestlers but every sportsperson the entire country worships cricket but notsingle cricketer has spoken up we arensaying you speak in our favour but at least put outneutral message and say there should be justice for whichever party this is what pains me also read brij bhushan sharan singh and anand mohan how justice is politically mediated every sports federation hasproblem andlot of athletes are my friends as well but there should be no pretensionsgo to their matches they come for mine we getphoto clicked together congratulate one another upon winningmedal put nice messages like onwards and upwards athletes need to get out of the social media bubble and express real world emotions they should look beyond their personal gains and ask their conscience we are human we will also quit the sport someday we should leavelegacy outside sports too sriram veera you spoke about lack of support some might fear oh this issensitive issue how do we know what really happened how can we get into this what do you have to say to those people what do they think will we do these things just to get exemption from trials or not take part in national championships we dontake these allegations lightly they should have this common sense if you canraise your voice against the system if this was suchsmall issue then why would we fight this battle that ll only lead to lifelong animosity log kehte hai wrestlers ka dimaag ghutno mein hota hai people say wrestlers are not intelligent butll say our dil heart dimaag brain everything is in the right place other athletes need to check where their brain is dil toh unke paas hai hi nahi they donhaveheart if we dondeserve their support in these times of struggle then god willing if we winmedal tomorrow and we will work very hard for it then doncome to congratulate us donsay you had faith in our abilities because you didnthatwhy you are doubting us now sriram veera can you talk about your courage where does it spring from itmy mother our relationship is stronger than the bond between friends we share everything she was about 32 when she becamewidowfeel sad thinking about it she struggled for us in that struggle we didneven realise when we grew upsingle woman she would be taunted by others how they treated her before my father died my mother didneven step out of the house she didneven know what was the price of tomatoes suddenly tragedy struck then she suffered from cancer and would go to rohtak for chemotherapy totally illiterate she didneven know where to sit where to get off no one supported her we grew up seeing her struggle ifsingle woman like that illiterate could fight the society on her own and made us big wrestlers then we can do it too if we donspeak out today then all the struggles of my mother would have gone to wastewon medals thatall right but if we win this battle she will

Deccan Herald,union governmentindifference towards protesting wrestlers is baffling,imagine if wrestling federation of india wfi head brij bhushan sharan singh accused by seven women includingminor of sexual harassment was notmember of parliament belonging to the ruling bharatiya janata party bjp how would have the law caught up with him would there have been propaganda unleashed against those who have accused him by labelling them anti government incruel sense singh is lucky that he belongs to the bjp because otherwise he might have even been in jail by now evensupreme court intervention has not prompted the delhi police to arrest him instead of feeling ashamed he is holding press conferences accusing the congress and wrestlers of conspiring against him to discredit him also read delhi police yet to record statement of women wrestlers protesting against wfi chief this is symptomatic of the malaise which has inflicted the police system and even threatens the judicial system which if allowed to continue can lead to its collapse it smacks of partisanship of the highest order and exposes the hypocrisy ofgovernment which gloats about its programme focused on the girl child beti padao beti bachao this also reflects the fact that some of those who take great pride in the hindu ethos of very exalted status of women and quote the shloka yatra naryastu pujyante ramante tatra devata where women are honoured divinity blossoms there are duplicitous in practice in case of sexual harassment the law is explicit that the word of the woman is sufficient to arrest the accusedsexual harassment charge is criminal in nature and the wheels of justice should have moved immediately instead the government formedcommittee led by renowned boxer mary kom to probe the allegations this could have been justified if intent of the government was to get to the bottom of the matter to cleanse the system and put things in order so that no women athlete would face the same ignominy in future unfortunately the intent was to findpolitical solution the strategy did not work and it is not surprising that the athletes are unhappy with the conduct of the union government the union government has further exposed itself by not making public the findings of the committee report which was submitted in first week of april babita phogatmember of the committee has alleged that she was not allowed to read the report and that the report was snatched away from her before she could glance through if true this further increases the intentions of the government if the government was serious about the problem it should have not only published the report but also acted by now dissatisfied with the governmentresponse the protesting wrestlers knocked on the supreme courtdoor where the delhi police unashamedly has said that if the court desired an fir could be lodged the same day itself it took four months and prodding from the top court for the delhi police to file two firs both naming singh it is obvious that the police is not interested in pursuing this case but what is it that makes it so brazen ideally the police should have arrested singh in january itself but two things worked for him one he isbjp mp who is supposedly very close topowerful minister in the union cabinet two he belongs to the politically powerful community of the rajputs the rajputs in uttar pradesh are very influential and the bjp does not want to upset the community singh himself isseasoned leader and can impact electoral fortunes of the bjp in four five lok sabha seats around gonda districtthird reason is that the delhi police is allegedlycompromised force many senior officers in it are either eyeing post retirement sinecures or are those who toe the governmentideological line without questioning these police officers either do not take cognisance of complaints cases against the ruling alliance or when it does it is not inhurry to do its jobfew years back whenfew masked men and women unleashed violence in front of the tv cameras in jnu and later whenfew were identified as abvp activists bytv channel the delhi police did precious little more thandozen aam aadmi party aap mlas and leaders were arrested on frivolous charges in most cases the courts were livid about the way the investigation was carried out most of them were exonerated by the courts in the past the police has not taken notice of the provocative statements made by bjp leaders such as anurag thakur parvesh verma and kapil mishra serious allegations were levelled against the delhi police during the 2020 delhi riots in which 53 persons lost their lives two third of which were muslims during the investigations into the riots even lawyers who were helping the muslim community were intimidated and their houses were raided it is not surprising that the delhi police has not taken any action based on the wrestlers complaint what is surprising is its audacity despite the apex courtintervention it is disinclined to arrest singh this is not possible unless the delhi police has clear instructions from up the hierarchy is itcoincidence that the delhi police reports to the union government and amit

ESPN,wrestlers protest vinesh phogat alleges sports minister wfi hushed up sexual harassment complaints,vinesh phogat has alleged that complaints related to sexual harassment have been hushed up in the past by the wrestling federation of india wfi and that sports minister anurag thakur did the same by forming an oversight panel instead of taking concrete action vinesh the biggest face of the wrestlers protest claimed that sexual harassment cases were reported twice in the past during the national camp but the wfi succeeded in sweeping the matter under the carpet the world championship medallist said the complainants had shared their ordeal inmeeting with the sports minister but he did not do anything except for constituting an oversight panel the wrestlers had called off their protest in january after getting assurances from the government that the matter would be probed andfive member panel was formed to look into the allegations of sexual harassment against wfi chief brij bhushan sharan singh during the 2012 national campsexual harassment complaint was lodged atpolice station within 24 hours that case was hushed up in 2014physio who was also trainer of geeta phogat raisedsimilar matter and he was removed from the camp within 24 hours from that day his wife could not participate in any competition vinesh said before we started our protest three months back we had explained everything togovernment official how sexual harassment was taking place and how women wrestlers were being tortured mentally the athletes were being pushed tostage where they could have done anything with their lives she added she continued we waited for three four months but when nothing happened we came to jantar mantar when we met the sports minister the women wrestlers shared individual incidents related to sexual harassment the girls were crying before him but no action was taken at that time sports minister tried to hush up matter yet again by formingcommittee we have tried to raise this issue at every level but the matter was always suppressed said vinesh the asian games gold medallist also opined that people could now understand why they were silent for 12 years we had to play sport our career life was at stake and thatwhy we could not muster enough courage now we have reachedstage in our careers where we could speak itnot easy to stand againstpowerful man she said sakshi malik refuted allegations that the protests weremeans to claim exemption from wrestling trials vipin kumar hindustan times via getty images sakshi malik said the motive behind the protest as being projected was not to seek exemptions from trials she claimed she was asked to appear intrial abroad when she had already wontrial in india another girl in 2012 was asked to reappear intrial within 24 hours of winning she was vomiting during the retrial boutshad told her that we do not have status to fight with these men added vinesh vinesh also alleged that the delhi police was not doing its job properly the delhi police has not yet recorded any statement they are helping in breaking the victims using power and position delhi police is trying to delay the matter they are giving information to brij bhushan maybe we will get justice only from the supreme court the kind of language he wfi chief is using on national television gives an indication how he can behave with women inclosed room if he wantsfair probe he should himself go to the police station get himself arrested and co operate with police in probe after that if nothing comes out we should be held guilty said vinesh who added that she has not met brij bhushan in the last two years bajrang punia also claimed that they have support of many wrestlers but they do not want to disturb their training and

The Asian Age,nilanjan mukhopadhyay wfi mess all thatwrong as india sport politics mix,the writer is an author and journalist based in delhi ncr his latest book is the demolition and the verdict ayodhya and the project to reconfigure india and healso the author of narendra modi the man the times he tweets at the manner in which this episode has played out raises doubts over the bjp leadership having such an iron grip over the party as is believed brij bhushan sharan singh epitomises everything that is wrong with indiapolitics and sports management the ruling bjpsteadfast refusal to take prompt action against the president of the wrestling federation of india wfi is indicative of the duplicity of the leadership despite the seriousness of the charges and the protests since january the government dragged its feet on the matter the ruling partyleadership chose not to act on at least three occasions to swiftly end this controversy and secure justice for women wrestlers who accused mrbsingh of sexual molestation first the bjp leadership chose not put pressure on the accused to step down from the post eventually appointing last week an ad hoc committee to run the wfiaffairs second the delhi police inexcusably delayed filingfirst information report fir finally doing so only after the supreme courtdirective third and last the police did not move with the swiftness it has shown in several parts of india while acting against political adversaries and communities whose loyalties are considered suspect this lends credence to the allegation levelled most recently after rahul gandhiconviction for defamation that the same laws apply differently to people depending on their identity the response of the ruling party and the government so far exposes the disingenuousness of slogans and campaigns like beti bachao beti padao and the idea of selfie with daughtercall for which was given during an earlier episode of mann ki baat this is not the first time that the party and its leadership failed to promptly walk the talk earlier too there wasmuch publicised incident involvingsenior haryana bjp leaderson who stalkedradio jockey while she was returning from work after dark in chandigarh back then several bjp leaders defended the young man by contending that the girl exposed herself to danger by being out of home alone at night all programmes and statements regarding promoting the girl child and providing equal opportunities come tonaught if transparent investigations are not launched against those alleged to have committed crimes against women by not ensuring that the law took its course the bjp and government opened themselves to the grave accusation that it was shielding the accused the manner in which this episode has played out raises doubts over the bjp leadership having such an iron grip over the party as is believed this is true of the central leadership including the prime minister as well as the state leadership the chief minister included it has been pointed out that mrbsingh is necessary for the bjpfuture electoral runs in almostdozen eastern uttar pradesh parliamentary constituencies if this is indeed true it would mean that the verdicts in 2014 and 2019 were not chiefly the outcome of the popularity of prime minister modi and yogi adityanath to some extent the failure of the bjp to act against mrbsingh and also of the samajwadi party to not lend support to the agitating wrestlers is an indication that the bahubali model of indian politics in which parties hands out tickets tofew mafia dons in return for safe passage in more constituencies still thrives in india despite lip service by parties this isharsh reality despite the claims of the bjp central and state leadership that it has eliminated goons drastically reduced crime and marginalised gang lords that mrbsingh is still politically thriving despite his past gives rise to an elementary question are political leaders with criminal backgrounds and continuing involvement with the underworld from just one community being marginalised ita grave tragedy that mrbsingh is being handled with kid gloves even after three decades of being known asleading light of the criminal politician tribe the bjp had given him the first electoral nomination in 1991 from gonda for the tenth lok sabha the political coming of age for the party in up it wonmajority in the assembly and secured 51 lok sabha seats significantly mrbsingh in this election represented the so assumed plebeians as against the sitting congress mp anand singhlocal royal the rivalry between the two spilled over to the subsequent elections although in 1996 mrbsingh was represented by his proxy wife ketki devi singh because of tada cases due to allegations of having sheltered the shooters of thecompany significantly by 1996 anand singh had crossed over to the samajwadi party in the next polls that followed in 1998 anand singhson kirti vardhan singh entered the fray also as an sp candidate and defeated mrbsinghverdict that was reversed in 1999 importantly kirti vardhan singh is nowbjp mp from his old constituency gonda whilebs singh represents kaisarganj importantly all three political leaders the father son duo and mrbsingh have been in the sp too at different points the father was onceminister in the government formed after the partyvictory in 2012 this was the reason why mrbsingh was confident that akhilesh yadav would not lend his name to the agitators against him not insignificantly mrbsingh crossed over from the bjp to the sp whilelok sabha mp in july 2008 undercloud of allegations to bail out the upa government and support it in the vote of confidence necessitated after the left parties withdrew support due to the india us nuclear deal despite his expulsion on charges of violating the party whip and allegation of involvement in the cash for votes he was readmitted to the bjp in 2014 and has since beenmember of the lok sabha the ease with which the three singhs have been politically mobile underscores the limitations of all popular central leaders or electoral mascots it is evident that despite perceived unprecedented popularity if mr modi or even mr adityanath needs support of political leaders with questionable criminal records they will get it this demonstrates that the idiom of the campaign may have changed but it has not dramatically altered how elections are won the final issue the episode highlights is that sports management in india remains in the hands of political leaders either ruling party members or at least blessed by them an old tradition in india this was continued by the bjp disproving its claim of being an agent of change and new ethos stray nominationst usha as ioa chief for instance are made

Tribune India,sportswomen merit respect,julio ribeiro brij bhushan sharan singh the bjp mp representing the constituency of kaisarganj uttar pradesh is popular in his part of the country he runs many educational institutions and must be doing countless favours to his constituents to get repeatedly elected the bjp cannot afford to cross him even as wrestlers who have won laurels at the olympics asian games and commonwealth games have accused him of sexual misconduct chief minister nitish kumar has consciously crossed the laxman rekha he tweaked biharjail rules to hasten the release of anand mohan singhgangster turned neta had the mp beenmember of the samajwadi party or any other opposition party there would have been no hesitation on the part of the double engine government in arresting him immediately if and whenpolitician wearsbjp badge he becomes immune to the rule of law the wrestlers have waited for three months already to know the substance of the findings of the mary kom headed oversight committee formed by the sports ministry the ministry has received the panel report but not shared it with the complainants in sheer desperation the wrestlers approached the supreme court firs were finally lodged by the delhi police the same police that had flown down to bengaluru from delhi inmighty hurry to arrest disha ravi the student activist who used to mobilise the youth to protect the environment whenever any woman approaches the police withcomplaint of molestation official instructions are that an fir be immediately recorded and the offender arrested departmental action is taken against officers who fail to do so on the sound principle that women are not likely to submit false complaints when their own reputation and that of their family are involved this caveat has been circulated to all law enforcers throughout the land in the case of the women wrestlers the compulsions were overwhelming they were all nationally known and had each been congratulated by our prime minister when they won laurels in international competitions the only contrarian factor that the police faced in this case was the status of the culprit asbjp mp the delayed action by the police lends credence to the widely held belief in the country that the law can be ignored if the offender is fairly high up in the ruling partyhierarchy many legislators of opposition parties have been crossing over to the ruling party to escape ed and cbi inquiries if media reports are to be believedfew years ago brij bhushan had called teenaged girl wrestlers atlate evening hour to his residence to be introduced to him they had voiced their fears at that time itself if this information is correct why did the sports ministry not advise brij bhushan not to call girls to his residence and definitely not after dusk courts have stopped the police from summoning women to police stations at unearthly hours why can such rules not be applied to sports officials by the ministry many sports bodies are headed by politicians they know nothing or very little about the game but they crave the tangential benefits that accrue from the position these include access to funds and foreign jaunts to attend important contests and international meetings if the bjp mp gets away with it we can also include access to sportswomen as an add on for those officials who are inclined to misbehave modiji has stopped many malpractices in the governmentfunctioning he should prohibit by law politicians from entering sports bodies that would solve many problems the most significant of which would be extricating party leaders from criminal prosecution in the case of vote catchers like brij bhushan it is difficult for modi to avoidhobsonchoice of losing credibility or losing votes if the mp had not become the president of the wrestling federation of india wfi by fiat modi would have been saved the prospect of being damned if he did the right thing and damned if he did not the accused mp has blamed congress leader from haryana deepender hooda and wrestler bajrang punia for conspiring to nail him in this sexual molestation case would the women wrestlers have taken part in this conspiracy at the cost of their own and their familyreputationdoubt it and if he was so sure of his innocence why did he muster local supporters and that too in droves inmuscular show of strength pt usha isrespected athlete andmother figure in the world of sports hence she was catapulted to the highest position in the indian olympic association she may have beengreat sportswoman but she obviously has not thought this issue through and she may not be ready to take on the might of those who propelled her to the high office another politician now in the opposition bihar cm nitish kumar has consciously crossed the laxman rekha he tweaked biharjail rules to humour his newly minted colleague tejashwi yadav by hastening the release from jail of anand mohan singhgangster turned neta hailing from the powerful rajput community who had been sentenced for life in jail for the murder ofkrishnaiah district magistrate of gopalganj nitish has diminished himself in the public eye and can now bid adieu to any hope of being picked as the oppositionchoice for prime minister in 2024 left liberals and other liberals in the country were shocked when gujarat released prematurely 11 rapists cum murderers in the notorious case of bilkis bano that immoral act helped the bjp win the gujarat assembly elections that followed the release the release of anand mohan in bihar may attract his communityvotes but will it help to upset the bjpapplecart in the 2024 lok sabha electionsdoubt it gujaratis and biharis are different identical outcomes are not possible as cultures and attitudes differ the supreme court should intervene to lay down that 14 20 30 years of imprisonment are specifically prescribed while awardinglife sentence and more importantly periods spent on parole should be

The Hindu,bajrang sakshi slam usha declare sexual harassment cannot bepolitical issue,may 02 2023 08 57 pm updated 08 57 pm ist new delhi bajrang punia and sakshi malik on tuesday took on the indian olympic association top brass directly slamming them for their comments and actions on not just the ongoing wrestlers protest but also the entire issue of sexual harassment in indian sports all of us come from ordinary backgrounds where even getting to watch sports on television wasbig deal whenstarted understanding sports for the first time and heard aboutt usha and her achievementsalways wondered ifcould ever meet her people like usha sania mirza sachin sir they were the heroes we only saw on tv or heard about and always wondered if we would ever be able to meet them in person we had heard of how politics changes people and destroys relations now we are seeing that happen if aswoman and the ioa president you cannot understand the problems offemale athlete what will you do with such power and position sakshi questioned talking to select media as their protest entered the 10th day we were uncertain earlier but as the fight continues the kind of things usha said and mary kom athletes commission chairperson hasneven bothered to comment if such big stars of indian sports cannot stand with us on suchserious issue we feel we are 1000 times better and thatwhat gives us strength she declared asked about brij bhushan sharan singhallegations of the protest being political bajrang retorted that it would have been one if there were any demands or allegations that might benefit someone we are not even talking about his corruption or administration we are only talking of sexual harassment how can that be political this is notdifficult fight but the kind of things he and his people are doing to divert attention is wrong he said he also dared singh to make any evidence he had against him publicwant to tell him through the media to make it all public we are not afraid yesspoke of getting girls to talk it is our responsibility to give courage and support those who want to speak up but are scared there are seven complainants and he is trying to break them sending money and threats to their families even though their identities are supposed to be secret the delhi police is not doing anything sakshi added that so far neither had any girl been called for registering her statement nor any summons issued to singh which putsquestion mark on their fairness if we win this fight it will change the entire sporting ecosystem in india will spare the next generation of all this and will be our payback tosport that has given us everything she declared asked if the wrestlers would consider ending their protest if the supreme court in its hearing on friday assures them of monitoring the investigation bajrang was non committal we will talk to our elders and our legal team and then decide because it iscourt matter and they will know the best way forward he said both sakshi and bajrang also acknowledged that their wrestling career was all but over now he singh has already retired us and we also know that if he or his people continue to run the federation then there is nothing left for us buthave played enough and at every major competition but the youngsters coming up they have their entire lives and careers ahead that is also the reason we are asking everyone even those who are supporting us to come here this is an important year in terms of competitions and we do not want their training or their future to be affected we were prepared for the worst before we started out what we did not expect was the kind of support he is getting bajrang said asked if this was the toughest fight of their careers sakshi laughed not at all wrestling haslot more struggle before every competition we go throughlot physically mentally and emotionally that isdifferent level of struggle and feeling that feeling has not even started here till now we are fighting forgood cause whatthe struggle in that she declared,"['may', '02', '2023', '08', '57', 'pm', 'updated', '08', '57', 'pm', 'ist', 'new', 'delhi', 'bajrang', 'punia', 'and', 'sakshi', 'malik',

wfi president brij bhushan sharan singh the man in the eye of the storm apparently has an option charted out for himself singh according to sources is willing to cross over to the samajwadi party sp if the bjp initiates action against him he gave an indication to this effect last week when he praised sp president akhilesh yadav for not supporting the wrestlers who have been demanding action against him akhilesh knows the trutham being targetted for political reasons all wrestlers come fromsocialist background he had said the developments on this score have become clearer with the samajwadi party asking its media panellists not to support or oppose singh in television debates as per the sources the bjp is unwilling to takedecision on the controversy because it does not wish to upset the apple cart in eastern uttar pradesh where singh wields considerable influence lok sabha elections are justfew months away and singh wields influence in at least six to seven lok sabha seats the party has adoptedwait and watch attitude and we hope that the controversy will die down soon saidsenior party functionary the samajwadi party on the other hand will be ready to welcome singh into its fold if he does decide to join sp the sp does not havethakur leader of stature and after its relationship with independent legislator raja bhaiyya deteriorated the party is facingvacuum where thakur leadership is concerned incidentally brij bhushan sharan singh who sharedwarm rapport with mulayam singh yadav had joined sp in 2008 after being expelled from bjp for cross voting in favour of

The Indian Express,competitions and camps should not be held in up vinesh phogat,national camps trails and competitions must be held outside uttar pradesh the home state of wrestling federation of india wfi president brijbhushan sharan singh world championship medallist vinesh phogat said phogat is among the wrestlers protesting at jantar mantar demanding the arrest of singh alsobjp mp against whom seven women wrestlers have filed complaints of sexual harassment the police have filed two separate firs this needs to be overseen by the government we have not stopped the national camps from happening if the camps will be held in lucknow or the other areas of up that are under brij bhushancontrol we definitely haveproblem anywhere else in india we donmind the young wrestlers need to continue their training and competitions vinesh said vinesh had previously said that she and the other protesting wrestlers including olympic medallists bajrang punia and sakshi malik need to get back into shape with the asian games and the olympic qualification cycle fast approaching they trained in new delhi on monday and tuesday fitness is down our bodies are swelling and getting dehydrated because we re sitting here long hours we need to build it back up butfew days of consistent training will do that on saturday night members of the wrestlers advisory committee met with representatives of the sports authority of india sai including director general sandip pradhan among their demands wasban on any family members of brij bhushaninvolvement in the wfi going forward brijbhushanson karan bhushan singh is the vice president of the wfi andmember of its executive committee we want the future of wrestlers to be secure once hegone if someone just like him becomes the president then how will anything change vinesh said adding that any experienced and qualified member of the huge wrestling family in india should be put in charge of the federation next afterthorough background check tuesday was the 17th day of protests but despitehuge show of support from farmers and khap leaders who are assisting the wrestlers in making decisions regarding the protest the numbers at jantar mantar sawdecline vinesh insisted however that the protest will not fizzle out soon and that only big crowds are not indicative of the support they are receiving from across the country advertisement it doesnmatter how many people are sitting here what matters is how people connect to this which is coming through messages social media posts and other emotions she said insisting that this is no longer an agitation but insteadmovement vinesh said that the reason why she feels so many women have connected to their protest is that in all fields across the country they have had to face similar problems thisvery long fight for the truth and to remind people of the reality go into corporates sports entertainment or any industry women are struggling with these issues she said people should realise that even in sports even at the very top level these things happen so this isfight to get the truth out about the problems that women face everywhere we would like them to come forward and share their stories and maybe if they couldnfind justice by joining us they could advertisement she added that she wishes this movement spreads throughout the country rather than staying relevant in the northern states where wrestling is popular and major support is coming from there is an acknowledgement that the protests may not come to an end any time soon as police conduct investigations after filing firs against brij bhushan if they arrest him today we ll leave if they donwe could even be here for six months so we will sit for however long we have to it is in their hands how long

Tribune India,bahubali power play,rohit mahajan even the most powerful people of the land are oppressed by the yoke of compulsion this compulsion however is not particularly oppressive or repugnant to them because itthe compulsion of power indemocracy where votes and numbers are of the utmost importance notions of justice and fairplay are expendable these are the lessons from the reactions of bjp leaders over serious allegations of sexual harassment made by female wrestlers against brij bhushan sharan singh the bjp member of parliament from gonda in uttar pradesh and the wrestling federation of india wfi president singh seems to be just the sort of electable candidates who are courted by political parties despite their shady past in the 1990s singh spent months in jail after being arrested under the terrorist and disruptive activities prevention act for allegedly helping associates of gangster dawood ibrahim he has several criminal cases pending against him including attempt to murder on camera he has confessed to killingperson in 2004 ghanshyam shukla died inroad accident after replacing singh as the bjpcandidate from gonda and then prime minister atal bihari vajpayee called singh and said marva diya you had him killed the same year his son shot himself with singhlicensed gun addressing singh thus you have not proved to begood father you have never cared about my sister or me you thought only of yourself we see our future as dark suchman carryingbaggage of crime extreme emotions trauma and entitlement exudes bad karma and proves to bepolitical time bomb logically he should be an anathema to all political parties for his past his actions the allegations against him would be in conflict with the avowed principles of any political outfit yet singh thrives delhi police filedsexual harassment case against him on the complaint of female wrestlers only after being asked to do so by the supreme court one of the complainants is underage asdelhi police statement noted the first fir has been registered under the protection of children from sexual offences pocso act along with relevant sections of the indian penal code ipc it was filed based on the allegations ofminor ita non bailable offence and legal experts say that arresting an accused in such cases is the norm even though arrest is not mandatory singh hasnbeen arrested for some reason could it be that hea powerful politician from the ruling party at the centre and wields significant power through his businesses and vote bank in gonda that would bereasonable conclusion top indian wrestler bajrang punia has thrown his lot with the protesters atsignificant risk to his career what is the force that drives him apart from the wish for justice to prevail and the betiyan of india to be safe well hemarried to sangeeta phogat herselfwrestler and cousin to vinesh phogatprominent face of the wrestlers protest bajrang says he knows what female wrestlers have gone through bajrang and the other wrestlers astutely had foretold the likely response from singhsupporters and party brethren after opposition leaders visited the protest site at jantar mantar union minister meenakshi lekhi said when people who are caught by the ed who are involved in the excise scam and facing heat oversheesh mahal of rs 45 crore reach there the credibility of the dharna gets dented with these discredited people joining in what more can be said she said the government hasvery sensitive approach towards the wrestlers and women the partysupport for singhpocso accused belies this claim politicians in sport some well meaning but naïve commentators have suggested that the political leadership across the spectrum must bar politicians from administrative positions in sports associations just which political party is free of politicians who are or have been sports administrators prime minister narendra modi gave up his position as the gujarat cricket association president only after being elected as the pm he was replaced by amit shah the current gca president is dhanraj parimal nathwani son of rajya sabha mp parimal nathwaniysr congress member anddirector at reliance industries

The Wire,for bajrang dalpmchant for bajrang puniamidnight police assault,bengaluru the delhi policemidnight manhandling of protesting wrestlers at jantar mantar is the latest instance of the bharatiya janata party led union governmentinclination to crush any form of dissent not many would have thought that even internationally reputed indian wrestlers and olympic medalists like sakshi malik and bajrang punia will be treated with the same apathy as most other groups who have had reason to protest in the recent past the wrestlers have been demanding punishment for alleged sexual offenders in the wrestling federation of india wfi they claim that the wfi president and bjp mp brij bhushan singh and some coaches have sexually harassed multiple female athletes for similar accusations againstj akbar the union government had swiftly removed the former union minister but it has been largely muted in its response to the wrestlers protest singh is an extremely powerful and resourceful mp from uttar pradesh and has never hidden his strongman image he is rumoured to havedirect or indirect role in several crimes including murders even while dismissing such accusations singh himself admitted to have committed only one murder he is said to have great influence in overdozen assembly seats in upgonda which is why the bjp is reluctant in letting him go the assault on wrestlers on the night of may 3 2023 isculmination of many moves already made by the government and its bjp supporters to malign and invalidate the serious charges that the wrestlers have been making against the governing members of the wfi first the union sports minister anurag singh thakur claimed that he had already met the protesting wrestlers for over 12 hours and heard their accusations however the wrestlers denied having ever met thakur alleging that many requests made to the ministers went unheard singh on the other hand accused the wrestlers of conspiring against him at the behest ofpolitician and an industrialist at the same time the bjp and compliant media have only complemented each other in efforts to protect singh by equating the wrestlersprotests over sexual harassment allegations with those who it could easily berate as the tukde tukde gang or anti india now following the assault on wrestlers by alleged non uniformed drunk policemen the government has transformed the site of their protest intofortress guarded by more policemen the heavy barricading of the protest site reeks of the criminal treatment that the government has meted out to the indian wrestlers heavy barricading at jantar mantar after last nightstandoff between delhi and police and protesting wrestlers media is also not being allowed inside pic twitter com k6davqtnxk himanshi dahiya may 4 2023 the chain of events around the wrestlersagitation only highlights the fact that the union government may have settemplate to deal with all forms of dissent the justness of the cause simply does not matter to the powers that be who have shown their incapability to understand any concern outside their own electoral interests the year long farmersmovement on the borders of delhi was treated insimilar way firstly the government and their supporters berated the protesting farmers as stooges of khalistani separatists the bjp supporters dismissed the agitation as sponsored by rich farmers and criminals when clearly all sections of the farming community were participating in it the tags of tukde tukde gang and anti national were slapped on them from the first day the farmers began agitating the government officials and ministers engaged with them in multiple rounds of talks but only to hammer down the point that the farming laws could not be revoked even when the government was forced to revoke the laws it has reneged on its promise of legalising the minimum support prices msp system like last night when the wrestlers were faced with police attacking them late in the night the protesting farmers saw multiple assaults on them at the protest sites late in the night the barricading of the jantar mantar amidst heavy police deployment reminds one of the delhi policeattempt to stop the marching farmers by erecting nails and barbed wires on roads and constructing cement walls the course of events during the anti caa protests were similar castigating the peaceful muslim protestors down by equating them with terrorists booking many supporters of the movement in conspiracy and uapa charges lathi charging university students and other protestors across the country creating riot like conditions through fringe rightwing organisations ministers deriding the protests that swore on constitutional nationalism with hateful islamophobhic statements all happened before the protest sites were uprooted by forces injoint action by delhi police and hindutva organisations the more things change the more they stay the same the bjp led government has only proven the old adage to be true in all its aspects while the protesting wrestler and olympic medalist bajrang punia who is agitating in support of his female colleagues is being reprimanded with the use of sheer force the prime minister narendra modi and the bjp has been defending the violent bajrang dal in karnatakaelectoral ground the congressdecision to equate bajrang dal and the popular front of india while promising to ban fundamentalist organisations has been projected by the saffron forces as an affront to hindu faith most karnataka residents are familiar with bajrang daltendency to stir up religious controversies where there are none most of them also know about the organisationproclivity for violence while whipping up hate campaigns against muslims but that perhaps doesnbother the prime minister as he has not only defended bajrang dal but has also asked voters to chant jai bajrang bali before voting in all his rallies over the last two days he has attacked the congress for allegedly denigrating lord hanuman by promising to ban bajrang dal modi doesnmind stirring up polarising sentiments if they entail political benefits to his party in karnataka his last mile push has been that of hardline hindutva alienating muslims further from the mainstream and using bajrang dal asprop to consolidate hindus along religious lines should the pfi now say that the central ban on the organisation was an attack on islam bjplogic was tersely summed by senior journalist neena vyas does the pm know ram naam is not the same as ram sena bajrangbali not equal to bajrang dal the latter the dal has repeatedly shown itself to be above law when bjp split the shiv sena was it insulting lord shiva she tweeted the governmentresponse to both bajrang dal and bajrang punia has beentale of opposites one bajrang has shamed the government for inaction against an alleged sexual offender and was therefore dealt withheavy hand withcomplete lack of humanism the other bajrang that has frequently seen itself as above law is empowered and encouraged to act with further impunity by none other than the prime minister the hollowness of bjpslogan sabka saath sabka vikaas shows through the two episodes they also prove that the government has different yardsticks for different people as long as violent organisations like bajrang dal advance bjppolitical and ideological interests they can be accordedposition above law andplace above criticism but those asking for justice will be nipped in the bud it doesnmatter that those seeking justice could be olympic medalists who brought glory to the nation,"['bengaluru',

The Wire,protesting wrestlers allege hush job by sports minister say delhi police isnacting,new delhi even after two firs including one under pocso being registered against bharatiya janata party mp and wrestling federation of india chief brij bhushan sharan singh on april 28 the protesting wrestlers have alleged that the delhi police is dragging its feet on the matter as neither singh nor the women who complained of sexual harassment have been called in for questioning the delhi police have not done anything so far bajrang punia who among the renowned wrestlers protesting at jantar mantar said according to the tribune the victims statements are yet to be recorded what kind of an investigation is this brij bhushan is yet to be summoned added sakshi malik the reason why the case is dragging and action is so slow according to vinesh phogat is because the union sports minister anurag thakur had engaged inhush job the wrestlers had met thakur in january and called off their protestday later based on his assurances but the promises he made offair probe were not kept we waited for three four months but when nothing happened we came to jan tar mantar when we met the sports minister the women wrestlers shared individual incidents related to sexual harassment the girls were crying before him but no action was taken the sports minister tried to hush up the matter yet again by formingcommittee we have tried to raise this issue at every level but the matter was always suppressed said vinesh according to the telegraph punia malik and vinesh have been at the forefront of the protests against singh vineshsister babita phogat who is alsowrestler had joined the bjp in 2019 and the recent protests have emerged aspoint of disagreement between the two sisters babita has questioned the protests even alleging that they arepolitical ploy if you are not standing for the rights of aggrieved female wrestlers babita sisterrequest you with folded hands not to weaken our movement it has taken years for female wrestlers to speak up against their abusers you are alsowoman try to understand our pain vinesh tweeted recently babita is part of the government appointed panel that was appointed to probe the allegations against singh led by boxer mary kom however the protestors say they have lost faith in this committee which is not acting in the best interests of the sportspeoplet usha head of the indian olympics association has also criticised the protests we are much better than people like mary kom andt usha if former athletes such as them do not support us ita matter of shame we do not want them to sit here with us we just want them to support us malik said according to the tribunehave been hearing since my childhood that politicians cannot be trusted as they turn on their families they usha and mary have proved it these are the peoplegrew up watching and aspired to become buthave learnt my lessons the hard way punia too agreed that these sportspeople were now more worried about their positions than the safety of those playing the games pt usha must realise that she got this position because of her sports achievements but she has becomepolitician now he said singh meanwhile recently declared that all the complainants against him there were seven women who approached the delhi police have been paid the protesting wrestlers according to him were those who were at shaheen bagh and the farmers protest despite the unseasonal rains in new delhi the wrestlers have remained at the protest site in jantar mantar where they refused police security they have also decided to foreground the allegations of sexual harassment to ensure the safety of women wrestlers they said even though there are several allegations of financial irregularities verbal abuse etc against singh as well the wrestlers have said they will continue their protest until they can be certain that the authorities are serious about acting against singh as the wire has reported singh haslong history of being on the wrong side of the law but perhaps getting by anyway because of his political clout he has himself claimed that he has committed murder,"['new', 'delhi', 'even',

The Wire,the hypocrisy of sabka saath and beti bachao,sabka saath islie ordelusion more likelylie because exclusion is deliberately perpetrated and institutionalised in the bharatiya janata party it has no muslim mp or mla but says sabka saath with everyone its ministers garland those who are convicted of lynching the minorities but it says sabka saath who is it really fooling nobody but it wants to say these words because it is not honest or perhaps it wasnice sounding jumla at the time or perhaps that time was not right for the party to openly claim what it really stands for whatever we conclude as the reason it is inescapable that the slogan itself is untrue because the numbers do not lie beti bachao or save the girl is notconvincing phrase in the mouths of those who free convicted rapists for coldly calculated political benefit beti bachao isjumla when bjp supporters national heroines in their own field must sit in protest to beg for action against their oppressor the government is reluctant to act because the man in question islong term party mp and it senses there might be political benefit in not acting this is the only reason it looks away from and in that sense condones and encourages the harassment of indiadaughters and yet it claims to promote beti bachao though in court it is unwilling to reveal the reasons for choosing to release convicted rapists again mark the reluctance to reveal oneself honestly in how many democracies is the political rhetoric this disjointed from the reality of the nation one cannot think of any really of course it is true that hypocrisy and lies arepart of all political activity and that is the reason why many people are not attracted to it but this level of fake piety and pretend virtue while the deception is visible for all to see is likely to be unique to us and that is why we have to talk about it it is quite remarkable thatpolitical party can do this and assume it can get away with it forever but such is the arrogance of power and this time the delusion is likely real on the one hand there ismass media that is feeding at the trough and happy to be seen ascheerleader for the government if not aching to be an actual part of the official propaganda machine from them we can expect no honest survey or assessment add to thisset of the worldmost craven celebrities film stars musicians and cricketers unwilling to stand up even for their own when they are tortured and persecuted both are too afraid to speak and too selfish and greedy to put at stake the riches they have gathered through their fame and so externally there is no large dissenting authoritative and popular voice to point out that what is being shown as day is really night on the other the leader is shielded by those who line up to say in public the opposite of what is manifest and apparent and what probably even they believe to be true this works in particular with those leaders who have convinced themselves that they can only ever do the right thing they want to be shown the evidence of this and there is no shortage of people available to do this if the leader holds gigantic rallies when the second wave of the covid 19 pandemic devastates the land the aides will prove that his rallies do not spread covid the bjp first passedresolution just before the second wave started declaring that the prime minister had defeated the covid pandemic and then deleted the resolution from its website also read pandemic and elections in west bengal modiconjoint failures when religious bigotry is exposed as the fundamental pillar of the bjppolitics they will show that in the distribution of entitlements the party does not discriminate against minorities as if suchthing were even possible and as if anyone had ever accused them of doing this but let us set that aside for now if joblessness and low wages are being experienced by crores of people and being reported on daily they will conjure data that show this is not the case and india is in fact not only marching into the amrit kaal but is already in it the governmentown data that shows poverty increasing and consumption including on food decreasing between 2012 and 2018 is discarded because it is inconvenient no reason is given and the findings are not put out in the open for scrutiny we must accept the governmentword that the data it collected itself is so bad it cannot be revealed the governmentown finding that joblessness has hit record levels in 2019 before the covid 19 pandemic was discredited by the courtiers till the election was over and then released without change or comment this is the ethics and morality of those who surround the king and whisper into his ears that all is well the same people including women in positions of power are complicit in what is happening around them and choose complicity over integrity in suchplace perhaps it becomes too easy to believe in what one says though the evidence all points in the other direction it

true masters of narrative reshapingcouple of days prior an outfit called the united hindu front had set upstall right opposite the wrestlers protest it remained largely empty and not too many seemed

brij bhushan sharan singh the governmentreluctance to take him to task and even modi on the other hand they still see themselves as bjp supporters it is doubtless an unsettling place to be in whether they will continue to believe they are living in amrit kaal despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary or eventually succumb to facts and logic remains to be seen the proverbial penny seems to be

The Wire,everyone can find courage within themselves an interview with olympic wrestler sakshi malik,new delhi sakshi malik vinesh phogat and their fellow wrestlers are certainly not amongst those narendra modi can accuse of being andolanjeevis watching them at jantar mantar it is obvious that theirs is the world of the wrestling mat not the arena of public protest but the unwillingness of the modi government to take action against wrestling federation of india president and six time bjp mp brij bhushan sharan singh for alleged sexual harassment has forced them to sit on an indefinite protest in the heart of the national capital as crowds of supporters continue to swell daily at jantar mantar the wrestlers themselves prefer to stay in the back of their makeshift tarpaulin shelter away as much as possible from the nonstop scrutiny of the cameras lined up just outside the police barricade they givepress conference onceday and try to meet and greet well wishers as much as they can but generally keeplow profile if suchthing were even possible in this situation the media is not allowed inside their barricaded enclosure early in the morning before the crowds arrive though the wrestlers lookbit more relaxed but it is plain to see the pressure of the situation writ large on their faces on friday the supreme court ordered the delhi police to lodge an fir against brij bhushancouple of days priorspoke with sakshi malik first of all how are you doing smiling wryly you can imagine what itlike sleeping on the footpath we have been battling mosquitoes for the last four nights we trained here on the street this morning and then freshened up atroom nearby the rest of the time we stay here we eat and sleep here it is an effort to keep hope alive but we have decided that we will sit here till we get justice the prime minister100th mann ki baat episode will be broadcast on april 30 and many people are sending suggestions for topics they would like to see covered is there anything you would like him to talk aboutwould like to tell him thatwomanpanel should be constituted and their mann ki baat should be heard make sure there issportswoman on that panel and listen to her mann ki baat as well please understand how much we struggle and how many years it takes for us to get anywhere and the sacrifices we have had to make it is not easy to win an olympic medal you know what is making you the saddest about this situation my greatest sorrow is not for myself but for what others are going through asresultam always concerned about any trouble my parents go through on my account look at all the medalists sitting here and not just the medalists but all the decent unselfish people who have come here to express their support to us will god not listen to their prayers either for examplefamily came all the way from bhopal to spend two nights with us here on this footpath just to show us selfless solidarity they haveyoung son who is probably not more than seven or eight years of age who also slept here on the footpath for two nights other young people barely in their teens are also staying here with us we have to keep an eye out for them at well as night to make sure nothing bad happens to themfeel so bad for people like that butalso marvel at their concern for us so many people are joining us and that is what is giving us couragelot of farmers are coming to support you we come from farmers families my grandfather wasfarmer even though my father came to the city and worked atgovernment jobspent my childhood in the villagehave seen farmers struggle how they work in all seasons and how they weep when unseasonal rains comehave seen how they struggle to sell their produce and feed their families every day more and more of them are joining us it gives uslot of comfort and strength do you havemessage for women and girls in india who want to rise above their circumstances the reason we are fighting for justice right now is because we donwant future generations of sportswomen and girls to be wronged as wellwant to tell women you can raise your voice everyone can find courage within themselves if any woman will raise her voice she will be heard donsuffer injustice quietly raise your voice indian women are second to none and their achievements are there for the world to see did you ever think the day would come when you would have to sleep onfootpath never butthink god hasplan in all of thisbelieve very strongly in karmaknow that ifhave done anything wrong thenwill immediately reap the fruits whatever is happening is

The Wire,why india should heed the cry of its wrestlers,the wrestlers who brought glory to india in the olympics the commonwealth games the asian and world championships are today fighting cases in the supreme court against the state and its de facto instrumentalities like the wrestling federation of india wfi and its chief for alleged sexual exploitation of women wrestlers including minors this is notcase of the west accusing us of human rights violations itthe pride of india our olympic and world champions in wrestling who are claiming to have lifted the veil from what could be the most extensive and most shameful moral decay insection of our sports infrastructure the main allegationgroup of highly decorated wrestlers vinesh phogat sakshi malik bajrang punia and others have alleged that the head of the wfi bharatiya janata party mp brij bhushan singh and other office bearers have been sexually exploitinglarge number of women wrestlers for overdecade pressed repeatedly by reporters to give details of the alleged sexual harassment that the wrestlers had faced vinesh phogat said on april 23 2023 main aapko ek do example de sakti hoon kisi ladki ko band kamre mein bula ke usko pakad lena zabardasti uske saath koi harkat karne ki koshish karna wo kya hai wo sexual harassment hai wo kya hai callinggirl inclosed room and grabbing her and then trying to forcibly do something wrong with her is that not sexual harassment what is that complaining to prime minister modi earlier in january 2023 giving another example of the sexual exploitation of women wrestlers vinesh phogat said lucknow mein camp kyun lagaya jaata hai humne pradhan mantri se khel mantri se humne subko request karke letter bhi shoshan wahan easily hota hai why are camps being held in lucknow we requested the prime minister and sports minister and in writing to exploitation happens easily there the words in bold were completed by her colleague sakshi malik prime minister modi has said he personally knows not only vinesh phogat but her entire family while consoling phogat for failing to winmedal at the tokyo olympics modi had said to the wrestler kya beta bahut gussa aa gaya apne aap pe gussa kyon karti ho haan vinesh main to tumhare poore parivaar ko jaanta hoon varna aisa karo hafte das din ke baad mummy bahno sub mere yahan aao child donbe angry with yourselfknow your whole family so come and see me inweek or 10 days with your mother and sisters yet vinesh phogat along with sakshi malik and bajrang punia the three champions spearheading the agitation for action against brij bhushan singh on sexual harassment charges chose to agitate on the streets not once but twice to tell the whole world about the alleged deep rot in the wrestling federation of india why did she and they do that this week phogat again told the media maine pradhan mantri ko inki brij bhushan singh shikayat kar di thi jo jo mere saath hua tha tokyo ke baad mein unhone mujko bulaya tha main apni family ke saath gayi thicomplained to the prime minister about him brij bhushan singh about what happened with me the pm called me after tokyo andwent with my family the prime minister on his part has publicly voiced extreme concern at the way women are treated in general on august 15 2022 he told the nation from the ramparts of the red fort lekin mere bhitar ka dard mein kahan kahun humari bolchal mein humarey wyawhar mein humarey kuchh shabdo mein hum nari ka apman karte hain kya hum swabhav sey sanskar sey rojmarsh ki zindagi mein nari ko apmanit karnewale har baat se mukti ka sankalp le sakte hain where shouldreveal the pain inside me in our day to day conversation in our behaviour in some of our words we insult women can we not in our nature our sanskar in our day to day life pledge to stay away from any such talk which insults women if vinesh phogat had apprised modi of the alleged sexual assault harassment of women wrestlers including herself as claimed by her then it would be reasonable to expect there to have been initiation of some action by the prime minister surely an enquiry should would have been ordered if so what were its findings the unprecedented dharna by wrestlers at jantar mantar in january 2023 and its renewal this week despite prime minister modi apparently being made aware of the allegations of sexual assault harrasment of women wrestlers would indicate that either the allegations were found to be baseless or possibly that the rot was too deep for the truth to come out easily inshort time the silence of the bjp top brass is deeply disturbing the return to jantar mantar the dharna was called off in january 2023 after the union government orderedformal investigation byseven member committee which is headed by olympic medalist mary kommodi government nominated member of the rajya sabha and whose members include olympics medallist yogeshwar dutt who has twice contested an election onbjp ticket at that time vinesh phogat had told rajdeep sardesai of india today tv that feelers were being sent forpatch up between the wfi and the complainants that apparently did not happen and this week the wrestlers returned to jantar mantar the protesting wrestlers have now demanded that not only should the fir filed by the seven wrestlers be registered but that their names should not be disclosed publicly in keeping with the law governing sexual harassment allegations that the recommendations and findings of the seven member committee be made known and that brij bhushan singh be arrested and prosecuted enter the supreme court in view of the delay by the police in registering the fir the wrestlers moved the supreme court which not only issued notice to the police commissioner but observed as reported in the indian express there are serious allegations of sexual harassment in the petition which is instituted by professional international wrestlers who have represented india that the matter merited urgency and that the matter requires the consideration of this court in exercise of its jurisdiction under article 32 of the constitution in interview after interview vinesh phogat and her colleagues had said that the wrestlers did not want to reveal the names of the sexually harassed wrestlers in that context the supreme court observed for the purpose of these proceedings the identity of the petitioners shall be redacted and the cause title be read as xyz and others vs state nct of delhi and others on april 28 2023 the supreme court was informed by counsel for delhi police that it will register the fir of the complainants against bjp mp brij bhushan singh the case is expected to be heard again next week significantly the counsel for the complainants has asked forcourt monitored investigation which was opposed by the solicitor general in view of 1 the inordinate delay in registering the fir inmatter that involvedcognizable offence 2 the vulnerability of the complainants one of whom isminor and the alleged attempts to pressurise them and their parents 3 the profile of the accused bjp mp 4 the fact that the matter was being enquired into byministry headed by anurag thakur in respect of whom the supreme court has inseparate case of alleged hate speech asked delhi police why an fir has not been registered against him and 5 the seriousness of the issues involved as observed by the cji himself while issuing notice to delhi police it is likely that there could becourt monitored investigation into the complaints filed by the wrestlers the political fallout the opposition has been served an explosive issue onplatter by the modi government the protesting wrestlers who initially wanted to keep their grievances apolitical and had turned away politicians like brinda karat from jantar mantar in january 2023 are now welcoming political supportmatter that could have been addressed by initiating timely action against brij bhushan singh regardless of his political clout in east uttar pradesh may now become an alarming political liability for the bjp besides jeopardising the bjpbeti bachao initiative which could becomesubject of public ridicule there is no doubt that the bjp has lost ground due to this explosive allegation and the subsequent filing of firs against brij bhushan singhsupreme court monitored investigation if ordered would befurther setback to the bjpclaims to beparty committed to women empowerment the need for justice never in the history of indian sports has an allegation of sexual harassment of such extensive proportion surfaced the opposition may find it hard to resist the temptation to use the court process aspolitical tool to hurt the bjp but the affected wrestlers have nothing to gain from its politicisation on january 21 2023 cjiy chandrachud had inter alia said the philosophy of the constitution is premised on the supremacy of the constitution rule of law freedom and dignity of the individual and integrity of the nation it is hoped that the rule of law shall prevail and the dignity of our athletes shall be protected for that to happen justice must be delivered in this case and in all such cases intime bound manner rahul singh isformer civil

The Wire,women followed process but only sc petition could force police to file fir against wfi chief,it isnational shame that it took several rounds of protests by our women wrestlers before the delhi police responded to their allegations of sexual harassment on april 28 the solicitor general informed the supreme court that it had decided to registerfirst information report fir on complaints of sexual harassment and misconduct against brij bhushan sharan singh president of the wrestling federation of india andsitting member of parliament from the ruling bharatiya janata party in law an fir is registered on information ofcognizable offence the governmentsubmission on april 28 regarding the registration of an fir is an acknowledgment thatcognizable offence had been committed what then explains the delay and resistance to filing an fir in the first instance from what is available in the public domain evenminor has madecomplaint which automatically attracts serious provisions under the protection of children from sexual offences act 2012 the act mandates that any person who has knowledge that an offence has been committed shall provide such information to the local police and failure to report the commission of such offence is itself punishable additionally the sexual harassment of women at workplace prevention prohibition and redressal act 2013 makes it obligatory upon an employer to providesafe workplace provide assistance to women to filecomplaint in relation to an offence under the indian penal code or any other law and treat sexual harassment as misconduct under the service rules when the president ofsporting federation is accused of sexual misconduct the indian olympic association the ministry of youth affairs and sports the ministry of women and child development failed to take appropriate action as mandated by law the wrestling federation of india appears to have abdicated all responsibility that legally accrues when complaints are received reports show that women wrestlers made complaints of incidents of sexual harassment that date back to 2016 the women have alleged that there have been attempts to intimidate and threaten them for lodging their complaints this incident shows how women continue to face difficulty in registering complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace against those who outrank them in privilege and power in this case the person accused is not only the head of the federation but also has the backing of political influence also read listen to our mann ki baat protesting wrestlers tell prime minister modi justfew years ago the metoo platform was condemned saying women had not followed due process and it was argued that women had chosen to publicly expose the sexual misdemeanours of their male colleagues and superiors inway that was not just or fair women used the metoo platform because there was institutional failure to address their grievances ironically the women wrestlers sought institutional redress and yet it tooksupreme court petition to force the delhi police into assuring that an fir would be registered it is clear that often complaints of sexual harassment do not receive redressal or recognition until sustained public action is organised the courage of women who speak up must be lauded as they often open themselves up not only to social backlash but even the possibility of defamation proceedings being initiated against them it must be noted that the wrestlers protesting are men and women who are putting their sporting careers at risk by making their allegations public it also invites the following question if this is the plight of athletes of stature who are able to easily access public platforms what are the obstacles faced by ordinary women the issue of sexual harassment of women it must be remembered is pervasive and transcends professions and workplaces what this incident has also established is that often an offence of sexual harassment and assault is committed by the same individual and failure to hold him to account results in normalisation of such conduct the fact that multiple women from the same federation have disclosed instances of harassment at the hands of the wfi president establishesculpable pattern of sexual misconduct government bodies must be held tohigher standard of accountability in order to renew womenconfidence in the law this is the responsibility that we have not only to athletes who represent our nation but also to ordinary citizens the writer issenior advocate at the supreme court,"['it',

The Wire,indiawomen olympians on the pavement again where are those who are proud of them,if memory does not fail it was inrally in panipat haryana that the expansive prime minister once raised the slogan beti bachao beti padhao protect and educate daughters well two of haryanaworld renowned daughters vinesh phogat and sakshi malik along with other international medal winning wrestlers are once again obliged to be protesting onjantar mantar pavement in the capital city of new delhi against as they have been claiming persistent sexual harassment of women wrestlers by the chief of the wrestling federation of india wfi brijbhushan sharan singh six times member of parliament from the ruling bjp welcome to party withdifference that sets high store by the so high minded values of sanatan dharma when you recall with what demonstrative alacrity narendra modi greets such ones when they return from abroad with international laurels you would have thought that their shaming plight would have brought him out to be by their side leaving electioneering to satraps far from any such thing these national treasures have not succeeded in persuading the delhi police even to filemandatory fir in the matter given that one of the seven complaining daughters of india isminor inviting the protection of children from sexual offences pocso act provisiona the refusal by the delhi police to filefirst information report fir points but to one thing that the police may not be as free an agent as we are asked to believe is it to be thought that the all knowing numero uno has not heard of this matter yet the more fool you if you so believe after their initial protest at jantar mantar when they scrupulously disallowed any political agent to use their platformcommittee was set up to look into their complaint how them committees come to the rescue of the dissembling state you may not wonder the committees report unsurprisingly remains under wraps barring the leak that it has skirted the specific issue of their complaint against the chief brij bhushan and recommended closer interaction between players and administration was there evermore familiar non sequitur the complainants have had no choice but to approach the top court which upon hearing the redoubtable kapil sibal has encouragingly observed that the matter isserious one and issued notices to the delhi police and the wrestling federation returnable on friday april 28 long live the supreme court one may ask as these so distinguished daughters of india who have brought glory to bharat hold back their tears sitting and sleeping oncity pavement where are the thousands who once went to greet them on their triumphant return from international wrestling events were these fair weather followers who appear when the going is good and disappear when the clouds gather especially the dark ones that challenge the sunny vote catching affirmations of the powers that be how many bharatis truly do care for daughters especially when not their own and still more especially when the wolves who prey on them wear official lapels on their patriotic hearts most heinously news is that under the watch of this federation chief who was once also an accused under the stringent tada law hoodlums are busy threatening the girls whose names have come to be leaked unlawfully reports suggest that they are sought to be persuaded in every conceivable way to drop their allegations or else and the likes of phogat and malik are sought to be maligned as wrestlers who are past their prime and thus busy calumniating the federation chief the fact is that these wrestlers continue to be in prime standing and performance their request that the chief be subjected tonarco test one that they are willing to be so subjected to themselves so that the truth be out thus far finds no takers is it not time that the long standing sordid control of entrenched politicians over indiasports federations be ended and outstanding sportswomen and sportsmen be asked to take over the running of these federations know that the stakes both financially and politically are too high for suchthing to happen any time soon of course had this been the case ofsuresh kalmadi remember commonwealth games instead ofbrijbhushan sharan singh the latterparty would have gone to town to seek his congress head watch protesting wrestlers say they are receiving threats for complaint against wfi chief tailpiece do recall how the delhi police scooted with dispatch to 12 tughlak road once the residence of rahul gandhi in order to seek an explanation from him onremark he had made at the conclusion of his bharat jodo yatra in srinagar they did so in their grave anxiety to follow up on his information that some women he said had shared with him there to the effect that they had been sexually harassed thus the great protector of women the delhi police lost no time to dash to him so as to efficiently investigate the matter and punish the guilty you may well ask why it is that the publicly voiced plight of indiawomen wrestlers put in written complaint to the police has not drawn the same sort of anxiety on behalf of the betis of india and famous ones at that and prompted the police to makedash for jantar mantar as they did to 12 tughlak road is it after all yet again the case where the establishment says show me the face especially of the culprit andwill show you the law welcome to the largest democracy in the world which follows the constitutional order with judicious selectivity after all,"['if', 'memory',

The Wire,in sports or otherwise failing to act oncomplaint of sexual harassment is criminal,all the while that the nation has been applauding our sportswomen who have shown amazing talent and grit in international competitions these remarkably talented women it now turns out have been silently fighting another battle againstvicious nexus of patriarchy power and privilege if there was any doubt in the minds of people with regard to the nexus it should be put to rest by the fact that both sandeep singh the minster accused of sexual harassment by the athlete in haryana and brij bhushan sharan singh the head of the wrestling federation of india who faces grave allegations of similar nature are still in the saddle it is reported that while the former has given up charge of the concerned portfolio the other been asked to step aside and will not participate in decision making while an enquiry is proceeding based on the fir lodged by the complainant what should be noted is thatcommittee headed by the additional director general of police rohtak range mamta singh deputy commissioner of police at panchkula sumer pratap singh and additional commissioner of police at panchkula raj kumar kaushik has been constituted to enquire based oncomplaint lodged by the accused minister however singh still holds charge of the department of printing and stationery however as chief minister of haryana manohar lal khattar would have us believe this will not affect the probe meanwhile the junior athletics coach who is also400m national level athlete who lodged the complaint against singh was transferred to jhajjar where she said that the necessary facilities for her sport were unavailable the reportage on both the haryana incident and that relating to the wrestling federation speaks of the accolades those accused have won for the nation and their public stature this despite the fact that there have been attempts to silence the protests players simply want self respect as they prepare for big sporting events referring to the pressure on those seeking justice from the predatory behaviour of those in the wfi champion wrestler vinesh phogat has stated we wonbog down anymore and will fight for our rights for sportswomen supported by their male colleagues in the case involving the wfi to come forward and highlight the vicious cycle of sexual harassment within the sports establishment requires tremendous courage such complaints threaten to disrupt the ties that have evolved between the sports bureaucracy politicians and the corporate sector the complaints that have been registered need thorough investigation that is necessary if others who may be silently suffering are to pick up the courage to speak up there is an urgent need to put procedures to handle such complaints in place as per the law these are required at all levels be it talent search training selection processes awards and the administrative sphere democratisation of these bodies is urgently required to instil confidence in the players as well as to garner fresh talent as are transparency and accountability specifically in handling complaints of sexual harassment including the actions or inactions of those holding charge and responsibility for enquiry into complaints madeperson in authority who fails to act oncomplaint of sexual harassment is equally guilty of violating the law there is need to deal with incidents of sexual harassment by meting out exemplary punishment it is criminal to have ministers and senior people hold positions when as per the law they have been accused of crimes which include sections that are non bailable governments and those presiding over these bodies must be made to answer finally there isneed for greater transparency in processes of decision making this also includes selection training awards and talent search across the country it is important that eminent sportspersons come forward to initiate such processes to restore the confidence of the people especially women who have contributed in no small measure to achievements in this sphere the womenmovement in india has long argued that violence including sexual violence of which sexual harassment iscritical aspect acrossspectrum of socio political institutions needs to be addressed if women are to attain equality as also equality of opportunity such incidents cannot be approached asone off with delayed responses mired in calculations which smack of political considerations while campaigns such as golong way in enabling individual women to come out and speak the lack of response and abdication of responsibility at the top ensures that many go scot free as the supreme court of india averred in the vishaka guidelines employees and women are entitled toworkspace free of discrimination on account of sexual harassment which createshostile work environment equal opportunity andlevel playing field are the least that women in sports in india are entitled to while we expect them to win laurels for the country even as they perform in extremely competitive conditions under extreme pressure having fought patriarchy and prejudice all along the way as for those who still choose to speak up for the rights and reputation of the accused one is reminded of an incident in 1998 when rupan deol bajaj an officer of the indian administrative service spoke out against senior police officerpgill at that timesenior editor had in famously opined that india asnation does not know how to honour its heroes bajaj took her fight to court which ruled in her favour in 2005

politics to get it in your inbox every week sign up here click on follow have feedback interesting links or thinkm wrong write to me at theindiafix in january some of indiatop wrestlers beganstreet protest in the capital new delhi demanding that brij bhushan singh president of wrestling federation of india be arrested on charges of sexual harassment the protesting wrestlers included some of the top names in the sport including men and women who have won medals for india in the olympics on the other side was singhpowerful member of parliament from uttar pradesh belonging to the ruling bharatiya janata party in response the modi government usedtried and tested tactic to quell agitations it appointedcommittee frustrated with this delaying tactic the wrestlers restarted their agitation in april this had more success than the january agitation on april 28 after the case had been heard in the supreme court the delhi police relented and filed first information reports against the bjp mp one of them was under the protection of children from sexual offences act given that singh was accused of sexually harassingminor backing singh in spite of the severity of the allegations as well as the fact that the people making them were some of the most prominent indian sportspeople alive today the bjp has stuck by singh the delhi police controlled by the modi government filed an fir only after pressure from the supreme court however even then it has not arrested singh in fact singh has released statements brazenly saying that he will not resign as president of the wrestling federation of india how is the bjp managing to resist the political pressures that suchgrave incident could potentially put on the party part of the answer lies in the unfortunate fact that womensafety plays out in complex ways when it comes to voting in spite of the fact that women make up half the electorate by itself it is rare for womensafety to feature asmajor issue during elections instead communitarian identity caste and religion usually dominate indian elections along with economic factors such as inflation and welfare this cold political calculus probably explains why the bjp thinks that it might gain more by backing singh than by supporting the sportspeople who allege they have been harassed the wrestling chief started out life asso called bahubali or gangster and has been accused of working with terrorist dawood ibrahim later he built an impressive political network in uttar pradesh with strong backing from his rajput community lack of impact the fact of community identity trumping gender violence is true not only for the 2023 wrestlerprotest it has beenlongtime feature of indian politics the 2002 gujarat riots for example saw mass sexual violence against women however this played out electorally along the lines of communal identity the violence ensuredhindu vote bank for the bjp catapulting modi to the status ofnational figure as part of this politics the bjp led gujarat government last year released some criminals convicted of gangrape during the riots and the party felicitated them after they walked out of jail as if to illustrate this political phenomenon on sunday in fact one of the protesting wrestlers sharedmessage in support of the bjphindutva push in the karnataka elections so strong is this communitarian superstructure in indian politics that even the wrestlerprotest has used it khap panchayats of the powerful jat caste from haryana and western uttar pradesh have backed the wrestlers ensuring that the protests continue even in the face of strong pressure from the delhi police apart from straight electoral calculation the bjp is also helped by the fact that much of the hindi and english language mass media in the country does not report critically on the modi government part of this has to do with the governmentability to use the legal framework to reign in recalcitrant media houses in other cases owners of media companies are friendly with the government it is alsofact that members of the upper castes who dominate the national media tend to be strong supporters of the bjp the 11 men convicted in the bilkis bano gangrape and mass murder case being welcomed after they are released by the gujarat government in 2022 credit pti the upa exception this stands in stark contrast to the second term of the congress led united progressive alliance where the issue of womensafety actually did acquire the political prominence it deserves the manmohan singh led government was strongly attacked by the media in the wake of the horrific 2012 delhi gangrape and murder in contrast in 2020gangrape in hathras uttar pradesh saw much more limited media outrage in spite of the fact that the bjp led government actually moved to quell protests using draconian force by summarily burning the body of the victim in 2012 delhi had seen large protests for womensafety in 2020 the delhi police used force to make sure no protests happen given that evenlimited protest in the capital would generate tv images that could be beamed across the country and undermine the bjppolitical capital with strong media control and support from powerful upper castes the bjp has ensured that the media is unable to repeat the strong watchdog role it played during the congress years when it comes to womensafety while media control isstrong factor that helps the bjp government control the political narrative it is not impossible to overcome in fact sustained protests seem to be the one thing that can break it farmer protesters have successfully rolled back the farm laws while protests against the citizenship amendment act seem to have led to the law being frozen asresult while modibjp has successfully prevented womensafety from being an issue that could erode its political capitalsustained protest by the wrestlers against allegations of sexual harassment bybjp mp could in theory change that,"['welcome',

delhijantar mantar by the countrytop wrestlers against wrestling federation of india chief brij bhushan sharan singh and what it has revealed about the state of professional wrestling in india the wrestlers who include star names such as sakshi malik bajrang punia and vinesh phogat are seeking the removal and arrest of singhbharatiya janata party mp from uttar pradesh whom they accuse of serial sexual harassment of female athletes at their insistence and the intervention of the supreme court singh was booked by the delhi police on april 28 but has escaped further action thus far those who have made india proud time and again are facing such grave injustices if they can be brought to tears who will listen to us if anything untoward were to happen kajal said duringbreak from training at an akhada in rohtakkhidwali village where she has been practising since she was 12 she was referring to phogat and malik who broke down on camera duringrecent press conference at the protest site we may even have to quit wrestling if the situation remains the same kajalfriend and fellow wrestler simran 18 echoed her we will switch to kabaddi or boxing we are not sure at this moment she said what we are sure of is that we cannot continue being wrestlers if he remains in his position she meant singh who has been accused of sexual harassment by at least seven female wrestlers one of whom isminor although the wrestling federation chief has been booked for outraging the modesty ofwoman and under the stringent protection of children from sexual offences act his alleged conduct has distressed many budding female wrestlers and their parents in haryana scroll met and spoke with at least 15 such wrestlers and their parents in titoli khidwali and sunderpur villages in rohtak chhara in jhajjar and gohana in sonipat the three districts have been called the wrestling belt of india by former wrestler satpal singh and have produced such athletes as sonam malik pinki malik sakshi malik and reetika hooda trainees in my akhada are inspired by such personalities and like them they want to be known nationwide for their talents said joginder 40 who runs the only akhada for female wrestlers in khidwali but now there is additional vigilance by parents they accompany their children even to practice sessions every morning and evening this started only after chatter about the allegations against brij bhushan started circulating among pehelwans joginderakhada also trains girls from neighbouring titoli and sanghi villages but he has lately noticeddecline in youngsters or their parents approaching him to be admitted joginder left with fellow wrestling trainers from haryana at jantar mantar credit sneha nearly 28 km away in gohana trainer ajmer malik 53 echoed these concerns after the allegations against singh emerged he said parents have been reluctant to leave their girls out of sight even inside the akhada ajmer started his netaji subhash chandra bose academy overdecade ago and has coached sonam malik who wonsilver medal at the 2022 world junior wrestling championships held in bulgaria parents look with suspicion even at me andunderstand why the stories of brij bhushanconduct towards female wrestlers have evokedsense of fear among them he saidonly wish the best for my students and hope that more girls from my academy reach the world stage for the parents although havingmedallist in the family would bepride achievement their sense of assurance has been shaken by the allegations of sexual misconduct against the head of the national sports body that would exercise considerable control over their careers virender dalal 55 who runs the only akhada for girls in chhara village and has trainees from as far as rajasthan said he never lets them go alone to any wrestling camps the local camps are daylong andensure thataccompany them along withfew other pehelwans from our village but parents canstay with their children when it comes to national camps run by the wfi said dalal who also trains his two daughters everybody has now become afraid of that we donknow what will happen butam not letting them be there alone ever this hesitation is swiftly shrinking the opportunities available to young female wrestlers according to dalaldaughter swati who recently wongold medal in an inter university championship being in those camps is important for national events she said moreover escorting pupils to camps and tournaments is expensive in titoli antim 17 who hasbox full of gold and silver medals said her unclefarmer goes with her everywhere now from the morning practice to tournaments like khelo india some of the trips have ended up costing him rs 35 000 but he doesnsee any other option she is very talented and it is our duty to encourage her all our hopes are pinned on her the uncle said but if we do not go with her who will be responsible for her safety antim with the collection of medals she has already won in her fledgling wrestling career credit sneha girls who come from families that cannot afford to travel with them are slowly dropping out of practice according to joginder at least two girls from titoli have stopped coming to his akhada because their parents were not inposition to accompany them every day nisha 17pupil of joginder said some of her peers including one friend of hers are being told to leave wrestling for good there were girls here who came from families where every member was working to sustain themselves this sport is expensive as it is and revelations about brij bhushanactions have only made it all worse she said it would help ease the prevailing anxiety she said if singh were removed from the wrestling federation if we succeed in the sport and go further we may have to face the same harassment she explained this is why we feel it would be better if he quits wfi on may 1 nisha along with her friends from the akhada participated inrally organised in her village by the hooda

intweet on april 24 from the podium to the footpath said the wrestler with several medals at the world championships commonwealth games and asian games in the hope of justice under the open sky at midnight since april 23 several champion indian wrestlers have descended from the podiums and the mats to stagesit in on the streets of jantar mantar in the heart of new delhi in an attempt to seekfair hearing phogat sakshi malik and bajrang punia are the face ofprotest demanding that brij bhushan sharan singh be removed as president of the wrestling federation of india for allegedly sexually abusing several wrestlers they also want him arrested update wrestlers protesting at jantar mantar allege they were manhandled by delhi police the wrestlers say they hope to end the culture of unchecked power and subservience that engulfs the wrestling federation of india adding to the impression of such imperiousness is the fact that singh isbharatiya janata party mp this is the second time in five months that the wrestlers have taken to the street they staged their first protest in january but dispersed after sports minister anurag thakur promised an investigation into the allegations from the first time they hit the streets to the current protests there has beengreat deal of discussion about the wrestlers and their battle against singh what are their motives why now who is making them do it but though all the noise one thread stands these wrestling stars decided to risk it all by taking this position serious headway is yet to be made although finally delhi police registered first information reports could this entire saga have been avoided in an ideal world and what can indiasports federations do to ensure things doncome to this again grievance redressal observers say there are many lessons to be drawn from this controversy to begin with what many have failed to recognise is that sports isnon traditional livelihood for many indians there issimple motive for pursuing sport one that goes beyond acquiring national and individual glory it ismeans to make ends meet and provides employment this means that for athletes arenas and training camps areworkplace that makes the absence offramework like the sexual harassment of women at workplace prevention prohibition and redressal act 2013 in indian sportsmajor lapse every case of sexual harassment that happens in institutional space is down to the kind of power dynamic that exists said shadab banoprofessor at the centre of advanced study in history aligarh muslim university and joint secretary of the indian association of womenstudies and for that matter all these institutions are expected to have an internal complaints committee and itvery strange thatcommittee was not in place when sexual harassment is so rampant another important point raised by this episode is the need to address the failure of the system and why the athletes thought thatpublic protest was their only resort said deepthi bopaiah chief executive officer of gosports foundation we should be able to havedialogue and close it and at least make them feel like they re being heard bopaiah said she added in the sporting world in one of the most developed countries in the world insport like gymnastics something like that had been happening for years despite multiple complaints more than 360 kids were getting abused by larry nassar we donneed to wait for something like that to happen right this should actually urge us to create something and put inprocess nassar the team doctor for the united states of americagymnastics team was named in hundreds of complaints filed by athletes who claimed he engaged in sexual abuse for at least 14 years while purporting to provide medical treatment he was sentenced to 40 years in prison on paper the wrestling federation does havesexual harassment committee according to the wrestling federationwebsite that is the official name of the organisationethics commission which also deals with issues like doping age fraud and match fixing the composition of wfisexual harassment committee on their website however according to the sexual harassment of women at workplace prevention prohibition and redressal act 2013 an organisationinternal complaints committee needs to be headed bywoman and more than half of the members on the panel need to be women that is not the case here the panel has four men and one woman but the only woman on the committee 2016 rio olympics bronze medallist sakshi malik is among those at the jantar mantar protest the committee also lacks an external member who would be specifically equipped to deal with challenges like these withoutbias the federationwebsite also mentionsgrievance redressal committee but it is headed by brij bhushan sharan singh the very person against whom the grievance is directed also read with pending criminal cases wrestling chief singh accused of sexual abuse is no stranger to controversy the composition of wfigrievance redressal committee on their website while it is vital to look at sports through the prism of employment and livelihood the unique characteristics of the discipline must also be kept in mind athletes are required to stay away from home for long periods travel with others frequently and need the constant guidance of their coaches asconsequence professional relationships with fellow athletes coaches and support staff often become friendships dealing with abuse requiressensitised redressal system withinframework like the sexual harassment of women at workplace prevention prohibition and redressal act 2013 backed by something like the vishaka guidelines the vishaka guidelines areset of procedural directions issued by the supreme court of india in 1997 for use in sexual harassment cases in the workplace aparajita bharti founding partner at the quantum hub consultingpublic policy research firm said that it is essential for sportspeople to feelsense of security safety ishuge determinant of whether women participate in the workforce whether they feel safe in travel whether they feel safe at their workplace the same standard should apply for sports she said because it isprofession we are now building an ecosystem where we are excelling at sports said bharti it is something that we aspire for ascountry if the narrative that women are not safe in sports gets built it can actually have an impact on women participating in sports going further which would eventually be bad for the country too vinesh phogat did we win medals for the nation to see such days the field may 4 2023 reforms are essential the protest also points out an administrative failure by indiasporting federations following the first demonstrations by the wrestlers in january the sports ministry and the indian olympic association set up committees to investigate the allegations and manage the functioning of the wrestling federation however the oversight committee appointed by the sports ministry reportedly could not come to any conclusion about the allegations against singh the fact that this information was leaked to the media by unidentified sources and has not been made public has angered the wrestlers particularly during the second round of protests the indian olympic association set up an ad hoc committee to manage the wrestling federation untilnew body is elected however the wrestlers felt let down by the comments of indian olympic association chief pt usha on april 27 at which she claimed that the public protest wassign of indiscipline ioa chief pt usha wrestlers going to streets to protest is not good for sport shows indiscipline said phogat if we are sitting out in the streets there must be some reasonreason that nobody listened to us be it ioa or sports ministry her saying this is insensitiveeven called her but she did not pick up my phone bopaiah said that the wrestlers have probably taken to the streets because they do not feel they have been heardthink having the empathy and the ability to speak console care and giving them some confidence that we donhave the outcome yet but we are with you was the need of the hour she said she added empathy is so important maybe you donhavesolution but are you there are you making them feel seen and heard are you sharing that you are going to do everything in your capacity to get them to the right person vinesh phogatand bajrang puniaanother theme that is often discussed when reports of sexual harassment surface is the role of women in creating safe spaces still while it is vital for women to occupy leadership roles this does not necessarily ensure swift or just action in such situations bharti said that while spaces do not automatically become safer by having women at the helm they become safer when more women are present women also sometimes havelot of internalised patriarchy she said they also need to be trained about rights the escalation of the protest by wrestlers has directed attention towards the need to institute mechanisms to safeguard the rights of athletes as is evident in this protest powerful politicians continue to be associated with sporting bodies and standing up against them is doubly hard bopaiah said that the administrators must publicly announce those frameworks so that all stakeholders know that they are protected if something happens they will know what steps to take sometimes policies and processes exist on paper but neither the communication around it nor the training for it is happening she said all resistance is political in january the protesting wrestlers declared that they did not want any political support for their demands despite singhown background in politics this time around jantar mantar is being frequented by current and former chief ministers members of the opposition party and other active politicians the wrestlers are more than willing to accept support from all sides unsurprisingly after the renewed protests singh hit out saying that they are politically motivated why did the wrestlers modify their position bano hassimple explanation every resistance is political even if the individual is not very conscious of this she said inlong drawn protest she said participants consider various strategies that could possibly resolve their problem they might have felt that involving politicians at that stage might distract them or might disturb their protests she said they might have also assessed how the protests are being received it is natural that upon realising that the resolution of suchserious matter is takinglong time they are wanting to adopt different ways of reaching out what does it say of the country when it takes so much for hard working athletes to be heard one thing is clear indian sports administration is in dire need of reform,"['podium', 'se', 'footpath', 'tak', 'aadhi', 'rat', 'khule', 'asmaan', 'ke', 'niche',

Scroll.in,political overreach government control low scrutiny the challenge of reforming indian sports,the protest by indian wrestlers against the wrestling federation alleging mismanagement of the sport and sexual exploitation of athletes has brought to public attention the glaring systemic inadequacies of the sports ecosystem in the country on january 18 indialeading wrestlers beganprotest at new delhijantar mantar demanding action against brij bhushan sharan singh the president of the wrestling federation of india following allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse on january 21 sports minister anurag thakur said singh had been asked to step down untilhigh level committee completes an investigation into the allegations sexual exploitation in sports isby product of the skewed power dynamic between athletes and federations this flawed structure is the result of decades of misguided and sometimes malicious policies formulated for indian sports as well as the centralisation of control in the hands of the state change will only come in indian sport from challenging these entrenched power structures and empowering athletes to speak up against exploitation minimum consensus power nexus sports is one of the few activities that unifies indians there iscommon minimum consensus among all arms of the state that sports is to remainclosely guarded domain that is under their control this reflects in the failed attempts atsports law over the years that garnered cross party unity in throttling the bills such as the national sports development bill 2011 or the draft national sports development bill 2013 for instance in 2011 leaders of the congress led ruling united progressive alliance opposed the national sports development bill because they stood to lose their influence with the national sports federation the cabinet thus vetoedbill by its own memberfew years later the draft national code for good governance in sports 2017 was scrapped after disagreements over provisions similarly every new reform policy that is proposed to enhance the smooth functioning of sports bodies actually comes at the expense of the transparency and accountability of national sports federations in indian sports power is centralised incommittee or representative of the statejudge bureaucrat or politician procedural compliance and sports codes change willy nilly based on the regime in power any kind of reform will be futile unless this power nexus with the state is exploded credit via pixabay the policy of appointing chief executive officers to run national sports federations is flawed as the system of nominations and shortlisting of candidates extends the statede facto control appointments are politicised and highly subjective an independent form of recruitment that testscandidatelived and learned experience will bestep in the right direction although there has beenrise of athlete administrators they remain figureheads with little power without the political backing of the ruling regime for sports bodies to effectively exercise power they must be divorced from the state creatingnational sports ombudsman with representatives drawn from civil society and sports would bepossible alternative to the existing institutional framework the formulation of sports policy should involvemix of experts as former athletes policy analysts academics and human rights or equality opportunity activists with real say in the process which will ensure effectiveness equal opportunity and welfare while politicians provide policy direction it is bureaucrats who write sports codes and policies given the power these state actors hold policy formulation by experts will not be effective unless their overreach is checked thus bureaucrats judges and other state actors should have clearly defined roles and stick to them policy tweaks indian cricket continues to churn out talent and winners not because all the cricketing talent in the world is born in india but because cricket right from the grassroots level to the top is an attractive careerranji trophy cricketer has financial security leaving them free to work on perfecting their art raising the overall level of competition in the country this incentive is missing in other sports the current thrust of indiastrategy for the olympics is to identify potential talent and give them the best training and facilities to ensure their success while well intentionedconsiderable amount of money is being spent on creating the right infrastructure and facilities for athletes an athlete during the tokyo paralympic games in september 2021 credit reutersgood representation of this approach is the mission olympic cell which runs the target olympic podium scheme of the sports authority of india it is based on the flawed premise that india needs to find or produce its own lionel messi given indiapopulation it isstatistical inevitability that people with the once ingeneration talent of lionel messi or sprinter usain bolt are already being born in the country the problem is that they are not incentivised to keep playing the sport to leverage indiaedge over other nations with its population and demographic dividend sports policies have to be tailored to reduce dropouts this is only possible if an enabling environment that nurtures athletes is created complete with avenues for them to find fruitful post career employment mid career training education and more for example the short service commission model for the armed forces in which officers serve forlimited period that enables them to change careers after service could be adapted for the sports ecosystem data vacuum research in sports asfield of study is woefully underdeveloped in india the data on indian sports is inadequate andcentralised collection system is needed urgently superficial metrics such as financial allocations and output in terms of medals are measured the focus of data collection needs to move past this to delve intoswot analysis of the entire ecosystem to identify strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats annual data on the number of dropouts from each kind of sport and examining why should be priority data on the age gender and sport category of those dropping out will givecomprehensive picture of the flaws in indiasports policy such data should widely be made available to independent think tanks and scholars for analysis that will help enhance the academic rigour of sports academic programmes in newly established sports universities in india are limited to sports science the acceptance of sports policy as an emerging and exciting field of research can benefit india across sectors union minister for sports and youth affairs anurag thakur with madhya pradesh chief minister shivraj singh chouhan and union minister of state for sports nisith pramanik and state sports minister yashodhara raje scindia at the opening ceremony of the khelo india youth games at tt nagar stadium in bhopal on january 30 credit pti amnesty scheme finally empowering athletes to speak up whenever they are aware of exploitation is key to the success of the sports ecosystem and ensuring that national sports federations are held accountable the current system is designed to punish athletes for speaking up they fear rigged selection trials the imposition of legal technicalities and strong arming by office bearers if they speak upway around this is to offer whistle blowing athletes short term amnesty from administrative backlash from their federations if the fear of never playing again in significant competitions is taken away most athletes will be forthcoming in their experience within the system since sports isfield where performances are easily compared and reduced to numbers that are hard to argue against ensuring that whistle blowers are guaranteedtrial andfair shot at maintaining their careers after they speak up is notdifficult proposition an amnesty scheme giving an athletetransparent yet separate selection trial where they have the opportunity to match the eligibility markers set up for national qualifications will bring further accountability and scrutiny into the politics of sports selections in india there is no comprehensive set of reforms that can address all the problems that plague indian sports butmajor cause has been the historical lack of scrutiny although things are changing the culture created by vested interests will continue to influence all policies unless it is tackled head on all reform must first address this aspect

Scroll.in,with wrestlers protest against sexual harassment is india finally facing its larry nassar moment,the protest against the wrestling federation of india president by star athletes at jantar mantar this week islong due consequence of the most insidious disease in indian sportgroup of wrestlers including commonwealth games gold medalist vinesh phogat have accused the federation president brij bhushan sharan singh who is alsobharatiya janata party mp of sexual misconduct and financial misappropriation they were demanding that he be removed from the post as pressure mounted sports minister anurag thakur announced on friday that singh would step aside until an inquiry into the allegations is completed whispers about the sexual exploitation of indian athletes by people in power are unfortunately all too frequent for sportspeople arms snaking around their shoulders and dreaded phone calls bycoach or selector demandingmeeting are well known experiences everybody knows yet nobody speaks out is this indialarry nassar moment as the country facesmoment of reckoning just like the us did when the doctor for the countrynational womengymnastics team was convicted for sexually abusing hundreds of young women the outcome of the inquiry in light of the protest by indiawrestlers may well impact many other sports bodies enabling factors there are reasons to be optimistic the protest featuring prominent women athletes had the vocal support of male athletes and has gained the attention of the head of the indian olympic association pt usha however the nexus of politicians and vested interests who wish to maintain the status quo in sports administration in india is the biggest stumbling block to achieving substantive change indian sports provide predators looking to exploit vulnerable groups of people withpeculiar combination of enabling factors that few other sectors can match the supply line of indian athletes offersunique set of opportunities for exploitation many indian athletes are drawn from marginalised communities and lack the awareness that could protect them from exploitation by those in power the sports authority of india model of hostels for promising athletes while not without its merits also providesfertile ground for exploitation wards cut off from their families often at impressionable ages face constant pressure to choose the seemingly easy way to progress the sports ministry has asked wfi chief brij bhushan sharan singh to step down for four weeks whilecommittee conducts investigates the allegations against him the field january 21 2023 there are only two ways to progress in sports regardless of talent performance and patronage since performance can be limited by the opportunity to perform especially in team sports patronage is the de facto route to sporting opportunity and success in indiafeature that is specific to india which adds greatly to the nature of exploitation in indian sports is the lack of alternatives for athletes athletes if they drop out of the education system seldom have the opportunity to return and find gainful employment via other routes by the time they start looking for alternatives many are aged out of the system of recruitment in government jobs and other fields this addsdesperate edge to their struggle to achieve sporting success which is frequently exploited by sports administrators due to the historical ties of powerful politicians to sporting bodies and the revenue sports provide to media institutions there is almost an incentivised culture of hushing up whistleblowing indian athletes will always be vulnerable because the very nature and structure of sports rely on conforming to established norms and existing within the ecosystem institutional monopolysportsperson cannot represent india without an affiliation tonational sports federation this institutional monopoly underpins the unequal power dynamic between the sporting body visvis the athlete this is at the root of why so few current athletes can call out the exploitation they face they have too much to lose finally indian sports issystemic black hole that has often escaped the reformative scrutiny afforded other fields of endeavour the draft national code for good governance in sports 2017 does not have the teeth to enforce the safeguards and policies necessary to protect and empower our athletes because these legal provisions are drafted by the same vested interests that wish to protect the status quo the crucial intent for change is missing many false da wns have come and gone sporadic attempts at wresting accountability via efforts like the lodha committee reforms or the national sports bill 2011 have swiftly been shut down or worked around viasystem of proxies and backdoor appointments that maintain the status quo but if india is to truly becomeglobal sports power reform is essential anupriyaformer cricketer who represented jharkhand and delhi

Swarajyamag,how the wrestleragitation could have turned intocaste tussle and why the sports ministryresponse may have ruled that out for good,last week prominent indian wrestlers launcheddemonstration at jantar mantar new delhi calling for the dissolution of the wrestling federation of india wfi wrestlers from the states of haryana punjab rajasthan and western parts of uttar pradesh were among those participating on the third day of the protest posts that seemingly sought to represent the demonstration asconspiracy by jatt wrestlers against thakur dominance in the wfi started doing the rounds on social media allegations on the wfi president woman wrestler vinesh phogat flanked by olympic medalists bajrang punia and sakshi malik alleged sexual harassment of junior female wrestlers by the wfi chairman and bjp mp brij bhushan sharan singhmemorandum submitted to the indian olympic association ioa bygroup of protesting wrestlers stated that vinesh phogat was subjected to mental torture by the wfi president to the point that she considered taking her own life singh has been on the post since 2011 brij bhushan singhdeclining influence once considered among the top thakur leaders in uttar pradesh singh has appeared to lose his influence in the last few years he isfive time mp with his first foray in 1991 onbharatiya janata party bjp ticket singh joined the samajwadi party sp in 2008 and even got elected on an sp ticket in 2009 from kaiserganj constituency he again jumped the ship to join the bjp in 2014 he fought again in 2019 from kaiserganj and won however the sway he had once enjoyed within the party seems to be waning of late in 2021 he openly criticised his own partygovernment in the state and charged it for not doing enough to prepare for floods he alleged that speaking out would lead to being labeleddissident his hostile attitude suggested that he had fallen out of favour with the yogi government swift response by sports ministry with the current controversy erupting bhushan found it difficult to continue his reign as the head of the wfi in response to the demonstration by top indian wrestlers the government has taken swift action following discussions with the protesters it announced the suspension of all ongoing activities including the ranking tournament in gonda uttar pradesh which isstronghold of the federation president on sunday 22 january the sports ministry led by anurag thakur suspended wfi assistant secretary vinod tomar and called for singh to resign within 24 hours manufacturing caste angle the governmentactions seem to have come in time to prevent the issue from taking oncaste dimension singh belongs to the thakur community after the controversy broke out some twitter accounts had attempted to frame the wrestlers demands asjatt vs thakur conflictcampaign with hashtag stand with singh was also started in support of the former wfi president this portrayed him asvictim of caste politics trying to turn the protest intocaste conflict could be an attempt to undermine the genuine concerns of the indian wrestlers there were also reports of haryanakhap panchayats joining the protest that could have further inflamed the situation and potentially done more harm than good for the cause wrestlers keeping politics out the wrestlers however have so far successfully avoided any political or casteist association with their protest athletes like bajrang punia have made appeals to refrain from politicising the issue and have expressed trust in the government to address their concerns they have also actively prevented political figures such as brinda karat from using the protest asplatform for their own motives for now the wrestlers assured by the government response have called off their agitationfive member oversight committee has also been constituted to investigate sexual harassment charges against the wfi president mc mary komrenowned boxer will head the committee which will also manage the wfidaily operations for the next month other members of the panel include olympic medallist wrestler yogeshwar dutt former badminton player and mission olympic cell member trupti
